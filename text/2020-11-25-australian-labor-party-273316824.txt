ECONOMISTS SAY ELEVATED JOBSEEKER RATE NOT A DISINCENTIVE

TO WORK



The temporary boost to unemployment support has not created a disincentive to work,

according to economists.



Economists Professor Jeff Borland and Professor Peter Whiteford today fronted the

Senate Committee on Community Affairs today as part of an inquiry into the Social

Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Extension of Coronavirus Support) Bill 2020.



Professor Whiteford told the committee that while there’s always some employers who say

applicants are refusing jobs, the reality was that the average number of applicants per job

could be as high as 20.



Professor Borland told the committee it was difficult to see how, with unemployment

support below the minimum wage, it could present a disincentive for people to work.



Professor Borland conducted a study which looked into the time taken to fill vacancies and

the flow of workers into jobs



He went on to say that if the rate of unemployment support presented a disincentive to

work, we would have seen an appreciable effect on the entry from unemployment to

employment. But this isn’t the case.



The Prime Minister continues to contradict the evidence of the experts by cynically

insinuating that Australians out of work are choosing unemployment.



With 1.8 million Australians expected to be on unemployment by the end of the year, the

reality is that there are simply not enough jobs for everyone who needs one.
