TRANSCRIPT

PRESS CONFERENCE, GRAFTON NSW

WEDNESDAY 3 MARCH 2021





Kevin Kogan:

Wonderful to be here today with Senator Marise Payne. Marise is obviously the Foreign Minister  but also the Minister for Women. We have International Women’s Day coming up next week so  it’s great to have her here today in Grafton for an International Women’s Day function. She is  also - many of us know her history - but she was also the first woman Minister for Defence so,  you know, a wonderful role for a woman. It was great that she did that role, and she did it  exceptionally well. So, Marise, welcome to Grafton, and I’ll hand over to you.

Marise Payne:

Thank you very much. Kevin, it is fabulous to be here in Grafton. As I said to your assembled  crowd earlier, one of the challenges of COVID-19 in my role is it does significantly restrict travel,  but the bonus for me is the opportunity to spend some time in my large electorate of New South  Wales and to work with colleagues who I value and respect enormously. And it’s great to be here  in Grafton today. Not quite jacaranda time yet, but I will try and come back when they’re in full  bloom.

Journalist:

Specifically, what’s the purpose of this trip and your visit to the North Coast?

Marise Payne:

Well, great to work with my colleagues on issues that are of concern to them. As Kevin said, the  timing is very good for an opportunity to meet with female leaders here in Grafton in particular.  As you can see from the audience, we have school representatives. I’m passionate about  engaging young women in these discussions. We have representatives from business, from  farming, from across the community and, of course the CWA and the View Clubs and those  stalwarts of women’s involvement in so many regional areas. An opportunity to meet with  business people later today as well in a number of areas.

And I know that the challenge for business in 2021 on the other side of the worst of the COVID  experience in Australia is one which we are very conscious of as a Government. That’s why we  took the decisions we did in 2020 to provide the level of support to businesses and through  JobKeeper in particular to businesses and, therefore, their employees so that connection  continued with those businesses for their staff. It is why we are very focused on supporting  tourism, and I know this region has been in receipt of some support. That is an ongoing  discussion, and I’m sure that I will be hearing more about that today.

Journalist:

Just in regards to your portfolio for defence, is it appropriate for the Defence Force Chief to tell  cadets not to make themselves prey to sexual predators by being out late, alone, drunk and  attractive? No doubt you’ve read these comments?

Marise Payne:

I’ve seen those reports this morning, and I understand the CDF was addressing the women and  men cadets at the Australian Defence Force Academy. My message is that it is most important  that those who would seek to be sexual predators don’t - that they stop and that that behaviour  is unacceptable anywhere, anytime, in any circumstances. I understand the message that the CDF  was sending to those young men and women. My message first and foremost is about stopping  that behaviour.

Journalist:

Is that message appropriate coming from the top?

Marise Payne:

Not the words that I would have used. But at the same time, I was not present and I understand  that the CDF was speaking to a large group of cadets. The important, I think, issues that the ADF  has addressed over many years, particularly in regards to culture, have been addressed by leaders  like Angus Campbell over a long period of time, both in his role as the Chief of Army and now as  the Chief of the Defence Force. We’ve seen the Army, the Navy and the Air Force have to deal  with all of those.

I now find myself in a workplace where we are dealing with - I’m not going to say similar  challenges, because I think these issues are not directly equatable - but with challenges obviously  of workplace culture, as a government we have taken a clear decision about appointing an  independent review process, which I am sure will be announced shortly. And that is an important  part of us owning this issue, identifying solutions and progressing those solutions.

Journalist:

And are you referring here to the historical rape allegation?

Marise Payne:

No, I’m referring to the issues, a number of issues, that have been raised in recent weeks in  parliament in particular. When I began my remarks today I said to the people that are here in this  room in Grafton, I said that this is a difficult time for those of us who want to ensure we have a  safe workplace and a positive culture. But it is nowhere near as difficult as it is for those who  have experienced the harassment or assault that has been reported. It is unacceptable any time,  ever.

Journalist:

Should the minister who is addressing the media shortly, speaking about this historical rape  allegation today, should he stand aside?

Marise Payne:

I made some comments on that matter to Sky News, I think, earlier this week and on radio earlier  this week. It is very important that where there are legal processes underway - and I understand  they continue in South Australia - that they be allowed to take their course. I also understand,  as you have said, that a minister is making a statement on that, and I won’t make any further  comment.

Journalist:

But how does it make you feel?

Marise Payne:

I won’t make any further comment.

Journalist:

Marise, there’s a pretty lovely bunch of women gathered here today. This must be a special part  of your job to be able to talk to people like this?



Marise Payne:

It is an incredibly valuable opportunity. One of the things that we have talked about today is the  series of round tables that I have been holding as Minister for Women around the country in both  capital cities and regional areas. Most of them are smaller than this. This is a great group, and it  is fabulous to see so many schools here in particular and young women who have their whole  lives ahead of them.

Journalist:

If you were talking to some of those young women and they happened to ask you, “I’m interested  in politics but can you guarantee me that if I go it’s a safe place for me to work and base my  career,” what would your message be?

Marise Payne:

My message would be that our job as governments - state and federal - is to ensure with  employers and with the organisations that represent employees and with, in fact, the entire  community, that workplaces are safe for everyone. And that includes mine. And I’m absolutely  committed to working with Minister Birmingham and with the other parliamentary parties  around the building to ensure that we are addressing that. So I definitely want to encourage more  women and more young women to see politics as a career.

The world has been through - and I don’t say this with any comfort - the world has been through  too many of these issues in different workplaces and industries in recent years, whether it is the  arts, whether it is, as I’ve already referred to, the defence forces, whether it is our tertiary  institutions. We have been through too many of those to turn our backs on those reforms. We  need to hold those reforms, work with those reforms, work with the ones that are appropriate  for our own workplace to change it and continue to encourage as many young women as we can  into politics. I even told them that I didn’t mind which area they chose in terms of a political party.  I want to make sure that we have broad balance across the political process, but, of course, I  would try and nudge them in one direction in particular.

Journalist:

You hear those comments from the defence chief, though, he obviously hasn’t made them with  the intention of victim blaming, although that’s [indistinct]. Does that show that that culture is  still entrenched [indistinct] and practising it [indistinct]?

Marise Payne:

I absolutely reject - and I note that you did in your question - that the Chief of the Defence Force  had any intention of victim blaming in any way, shape or form. His observations about behaviours

are observations that he has made. Mine are about the behaviour of perpetrators and being very  clear that it is the behaviour of perpetrators that must stop and must stop now. And I know you  haven’t had a chance to ask a question if you wanted to ask a question.

Journalist:

Well, I noticed that you talked about being safe in the workplace. What sort of reforms need to  be put in place for that to happen? I mean, the things we’ve seen in the last couple of weeks  [indistinct] not a safe place to work?

Marise Payne:

Well, that’s exactly the reason that having addressed the issues that have been raised by people  like Ms Higgins and others that the Government is working with other parties across the  Parliament and independent members of the Parliament to put in place an independent review  of the workplace to ensure that we bring to this workplace solutions to address issues of safety,  issues of behaviour, cultural issues, societal issues, whatever they might be.

I do not want to second-guess that review - what shape that review will take - until it is  announced. But importantly, I recognise that workplace safety in this context is not just an issue  for the Parliament; it is an issue for every workplace - every single workplace - that their  employees, women and men, young and old, are able to come to work safely. And that should  be our overriding priority.

Journalist:

You know, when someone’s facing a serious allegation, shouldn’t they stand aside while it’s  looked into?

Marise Payne:

I made my comments on that, and one of the reasons that we are pursuing the inquiry, the  review, as I have said, is to ensure that we have a workplace which has the right sort of structures  underneath it and within its fabric to ensure that our staff and those who work in the  parliamentary building are safe in their workplace. Thanks everyone.
