Subjects: Coronavirus Vaccine, Returning Travellers;

DAVID KOCH

On to the vaccine now, the first doses are set to arrive in Australia within the next 48 hours. 80,000  shots will be flown from Belgium to a central distribution point here under tight security. The TGA  will then complete a final quality test of the vaccines before they are distributed around the country  and into hospitals and aged care centres. The first jabs are expected to be administered by early next  week.

Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack joins me now. Michael the landing, location and storage  facility are being kept under wraps. Why is there such tight security around this vaccine?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, because there needs to be, Kochie. We want to make sure that the safety and security of this  vital product - this vital vaccine - is kept very much under wraps. Of course, DHL will then distribute  the vaccine to its nationwide sources and to its nationwide outlets. It is going to then of course  hospitals, it is going to aged care facilities, it is a very clinical process as you can understand and as  you can imagine. We are rolling out this in the most safe and secure way we possibly can and all  Australians can be assured that that vaccine will be available for them as soon as practically possible.

DAVID KOCH

It’s a temperamental vaccine, isn’t it? Around 80,000 doses are coming out, some of them will go to  waste because of that temperamentality of the vaccine. What is the Government doing to ensure  that wastage is kept to a minimum?









MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well again, I had a look at the facility yesterday, they have got to store it -70ÃÂC. We have put $1.9  billion, we’ve committed that to the initial phase of the roll-out. We have very high-tech machines  which keep the vaccine at the right temperature. Of course, it then goes on to trucks at the right  temperature. It goes to hospitals and other facilities, placed on dry ice and everything as we can  possibly do, we are doing to make sure that it gets the jab in people's arms as soon as possible.

DAVID KOCH

Just quickly, Victoria has stopped taking international travellers during its lockdown despite the  Federal Government wanting to increase the arrivals of international travellers. Who is going to win  that argument?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, it is the jurisdictional responsibility of the states. They have decided, along with National  Cabinet last March, when it was first set up, that they would take responsibility for their  quarantining. We are assisting of course, as best and as much as we can. New South Wales  thankfully have had yesterday 28 days, the longest COVID-free local transmission run since the  pandemic began. New South Wales is the gold standard bearer when it comes to keeping the state  COVID-free. But look, I appreciate it is difficult for Victorians. I have a daughter down there,  Georgina, who is now obviously locked up as well as everybody else. These difficult times for  Victorians and we feel for them very much.
