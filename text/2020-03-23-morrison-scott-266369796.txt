JOINT STATEMENT

BY THE PRIME MINISTERS OF AUSTRALIA AND SINGAPORE

The AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂSingapore Virtual Annual Leaders’ Meeting was convened via video conference between  Canberra and Singapore on 23 March 2020.

The Honourable Scott Morrison MP, Prime Minister of Australia, and His Excellency Lee Hsien Loong,  Prime Minister of Singapore, agreed to expand the two countries’ strong bilateral relationship and  Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) in several areas of common interest.

At a time of global uncertainty, Australia and Singapore both offer a model of good governance and  productive international cooperation. In light of the prevailing COVIDÃ¢ÂÂ19 pandemic, this Virtual Annual  Leaders’ Meeting demonstrated the conviction of Australia and Singapore to continue with governmentÃ¢ÂÂ toÃ¢ÂÂgovernment business, and uphold the excellent momentum of our CSP, even as we each deal with  the challenges presented by the COVIDÃ¢ÂÂ 19 pandemic at home.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Prime Ministers discussed the COVIDÃ¢ÂÂ19 pandemic and its impact on communities, health  systems, economies and global supply chains, underlining the importance of close consultation  on the impact and the longÃ¢ÂÂterm efforts to build resilience and preparedness. They agreed that  Singapore and Australia would continue to engage closely to share best practices and tackle the  COVIDÃ¢ÂÂ19 pandemic. The Prime Ministers reaffirmed the importance of keeping markets open  and supply chains functioning to support the delivery of supplies essential for dealing with the  COVIDÃ¢ÂÂ19 pandemic. They underlined that a stable and open global trading system will be  crucial for a global economic recovery once the pandemic is brought under control, and agreed  to work together to that end, including in APEC and at the G20.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Representing substantial and meaningful progress under the CSP, the Prime Ministers witnessed  the signing of the Treaty on Military Training and Training Area Development. Building on 30  years of Singapore’s training in Australia, the Treaty underpins the AUD$2.25 billion investment  to jointly develop military training areas, as well as advanced training facilities in Central and  North Queensland, which will benefit both armed forces and deepen defence cooperation. The  Prime Ministers also welcomed the 30th anniversary of the Singapore Armed Forces’ training at  the Shoalwater Bay Training Area in Queensland which will be celebrated later this year.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Delivering on last year’s joint commitment to facilitate digital trade, the Prime Ministers  announced the conclusion of negotiations on a bilateral Digital Economy Agreement. The  Agreement will enable interoperability between digital systems such as eÃ¢ÂÂinvoicing and  epayments, promote cross border data flows, and address emerging technologies like Artificial  Intelligence. The Prime Ministers also announced the conclusion of seven Memoranda of

Understanding, ranging from Trade Facilitation to Personal Data Protection, under the ambit of  this Digital Economy Agreement, which will deliver tangible benefits for Singaporean and  Australian businesses and people. The Prime Ministers welcomed the establishment of a new  “Digital Economy” pillar under the CSP to supplement the existing four pillars.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Sharing a resolve to promote an open, interoperable, resilient and secure cyberspace, the Prime

Ministers announced the renewal of a Memorandum of Understanding on Cyber Security  Cooperation, which will enhance information exchanges on cyber and critical technology  priorities, best practices and training, and advance bilateral operational sharing and cooperation  to strengthen cyber resilience, as well as joint regional capacity building efforts.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Prime Ministers welcomed the signing of a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding

between Food Standards Australia New Zealand, Enterprise Singapore and Singapore Food  Agency to promote cooperation in food safety and standards. The Memorandum of  Understanding will also explore new areas of cooperation, including in novel foods and  alternative proteins.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Prime Ministers committed to conclude a Memorandum of Understanding in 2020 to drive

cooperation on lowÃ¢ÂÂemissions solutions, including new and emerging lowÃ¢ÂÂemissions  technologies. Australia and Singapore will work together on practical projects or initiatives in  developing hydrogen markets, supply chains and standards; Carbon Capture, Utilisation and  Storage (CCUS); and renewable electricity trade.
