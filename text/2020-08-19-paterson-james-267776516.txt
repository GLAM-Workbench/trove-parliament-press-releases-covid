New paper: Seizing the opportunity for free trade with the  UK

In a paper published by the Adam Smith Institute of London today, Senator James Paterson proposes  a three stage process for stronger economic relations with the UK post Brexit.

“In the short term the proposed Australia-UK FTA should eliminate tariffs and quotas and provide  visa free opportunities for travel for citizens of both countries.

“In the medium term, we should strive to replicate Australia’s world-class Closer Economic Relations  Treaty with New Zealand, which has unimpeded trade and travel.

“In the long term, we should lay the foundations for free trade and free movement between the  CANZUK group of countries including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK.

“The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the difference between trading partners and long term friends  and allies. In an uncertain world, stronger economic relations with likeminded countries makes  sense.

“Countries like Australia and the UK which share values and unmatched historical, legal and cultural  ties can help secure each other’s freedom and prosperity by working closer together.”
