Minister for International Development and the Pacific Assistant Defence Minister

The Hon Alex Hawke MP

27 August 2020

Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare today discussed key regional issues including the impact of COVID-19 and our joint efforts to combat its spread in the Pacific region.

Having visited each other’s countries in 2019, the two Prime Ministers committed to new measures to further strengthen bilateral cooperation. Prime Minister Morrison informed Prime Minister Sogavare of Australia’s agreement to provide further support for the development of the Tina River hydropower project through the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility, at Solomon Islands’ request. Officials from Australia and Solomon Islands are working through detailed arrangements.

This builds on our support over the last ten years to the Tina River Hydropower Development Project, which will provide electricity to the country’s capital, Honiara.

More affordable and reliable energy will alleviate pressure on household incomes and business costs, and provide opportunities for improved government and community services and entrepreneurship, supporting Solomon Islands’ post pandemic economic recovery. Using a renewable energy source to produce reliable and sustainable energy will enable Solomon Islands to meet its international commitment for emissions reduction under the Paris Agreement.
