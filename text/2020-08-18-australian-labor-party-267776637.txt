UNFORGIVABLE AGED CARE SHORTFALL FAILS VULNERABLE  RESIDENTS LEFT WITHOUT CARE

Concerning reports have revealed the Morrison Government has spent just half of the  money it set aside for a ‘surge’ workforce meant to assist aged care homes impacted by  COVID-19.

With multiple Victorian nursing homes reporting tragic shortfalls in staffing this is another  terrible aged care failure from the Morrison Government.

The funding for the Morrison Government’s surge workforce was inadequate to begin with,  which makes this shortfall even more unforgiveable.

How many more horror stories will we need to hear about residents being left without staff  and care that the Morrison Government should have anticipated?

It is clear the Morrison Government’s ‘surge’ workforce has been completely inadequate to  deal with outbreaks of COVID-19.

Why did Scott Morrison not have a proper plan to deal with the loss of workforce in aged  care homes?

He has said the events that have tragically occurred in Victorian aged care homes could  not have been ‘anticipated’ but his Government had been repeatedly warned.

The Federal Government is responsible for aged care in Australia.

Scott Morrison needs to take responsibility for any failings and provide families and loved  ones with answers to what has gone wrong.

The public needs to know that its Government has learnt from previous outbreaks and  everything possible is now being done.

Why was the Morrison Government not better prepared for outbreaks that would impact  our nation’s most vulnerable?

The Morrison Government must do better for our most vulnerable older Australians.
