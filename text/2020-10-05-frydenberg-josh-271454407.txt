MORRISON GOVERNMENT INVESTS $2.7 BILLION IN TRANSPORT  INFRASTRUCTURE TO BOOST NSW ECONOMIC RECOVERY

The New South Wales economy will be boosted, roads will be safer and thousands of jobs created, with  a $2.7 billion investment into transport infrastructure from the Federal Coalition as part of our COVID-19  economic recovery plan.

The latest funding injection builds on a series of statewide infrastructure investments from the  Commonwealth in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic which now total more than $5 billion.

Key investments for New South Wales include $560 million for the Singleton Bypass on the New England  Highway; $360 million for the Newcastle Inner City Bypass between Rankin Park and Jesmond; $120  million for the Prospect Highway Upgrade; and an additional $491 million for the Coffs Harbour Bypass  taking our total contribution to $1.5 billion.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Tuesday’s Federal Budget would deliver funding for infrastructure  which supports the Government’s JobMaker plan and help New South Wales recover from COVID-19.

“We have been working closely with state and territory governments to invest in the infrastructure that  is ready to go and can help rebuild our economy and create more jobs,” the Prime Minister said.

"These projects will keep commuters safe on the road, get people home to their loved ones sooner and  provide better transport links for urban and regional communities.”

“As part of the COVID-19 economic recovery plan we have invested an additional $5 billion focused on  shovel-ready projects across the state.

“This latest investment will provide another boost to the local economy and is part of our plan to  support an estimated 8,000 direct and indirect jobs across the state.”

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development Michael  McCormack said the Government is focused on delivering priorities and boosting local jobs as part of  Australia’s road to recovery.

“We will draw on local businesses to stimulate local economies through these projects,” the Deputy  Prime Minister said.

“Infrastructure means jobs, it means livelihoods, it means stronger local communities and it means  building a better and more secure future for our nation.”

Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure Alan Tudge said the Government was driving the  delivery of major infrastructure projects in NSW to help on the economic road back from the pandemic.

“Our investment in NSW will help build the State economy, provide jobs right now and give business the  certainty it needs in the long term,” Mr Tudge said.

“Key investments across NSW include $560 million for the New England Highway bypass of Singleton  and $1.5 billion for the Coffs Harbour Bypass, which includes additional funding in the 2020-21 Budget  of $491 million to maximise the benefits of this game-changing project for the community.”

“We will continue our commitment to NSW in the coming years, through projects such as the Western  Sydney International (Nancy-Bird Walton) Airport and new congestion-busting upgrades such as $360  million for a Newcastle Inner City Bypass from Rankin Park to Jesmond and $120 million to upgrade  Prospect Highway in Western Sydney.”

Since being elected in 2013 the Liberal and Nationals Government have committed more than $39  billion for infrastructure in New South Wales.
