Victorian Government sacrifices jobs and economic opportunities at the altar  of ideology

Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia Keith Pitt says the Victorian  Government’s proposed constitutional ban on fracking is depriving the state of the jobs and  economic growth the legitimate industry can deliver.

Minister Pitt said it’s a sad reflection of how irrational Labor-Green ideology is taking  Victoria backwards.

“Unconventional gas projects are set to make significant contributions to the economies of  Queensland and the Northern Territory, and at the same help deliver affordable energy to  all Australians,” Minister Pitt said.

“Research carried out by GISERA, a body led by the highly respected CSIRO, released a study  last year, which found that fracking has little to zero impact on the environment.

“The industry is set to deliver thousands of new jobs, particularly in regional areas, as part of  the Federal Coalition Government’s plan for a gas-fired recovery from the economic impacts  of COVID-19.

“Instead of looking at ways to make the most of the opportunities the gas industry can  provide Victorians, the Labor Government is more concerned about appeasing its green-left  fringe,” Minister Pitt said.

“After the economic damage caused by coronavirus lockdowns in the state, this symbolic  gesture of amending the state’s constitution will only further restrict Victoria’s ability to re-build its economy at a time when Victorians are looking to their government for true  leadership,” Minister Pitt said.
