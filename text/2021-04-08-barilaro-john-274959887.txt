BUSHFIRE COMMUNITY RECOVERY OFFICERS AVAILABLE TO ASSIST  WITH FLOOD RECOVERY

As many bushfire impacted communities are now dealing with flood recovery, it is more  important than ever to keep community liaison and support officers on the ground.

Federal Minister for Emergency Management David Littleproud and New South Wales  Deputy Premier and Minister Responsible for Disaster Recovery John Barilaro today  announced a 12-month extension to the provision of NSW bushfire Community Recovery  Officers (CROs), with their support services extending to flood recovery as well.

The extension means community-based liaison officers are available to help bushfire and  flood victims navigate immediate assistance, grants for household and structural repairs,  and other recovery needs.

Minister Littleproud said local council-appointed CROs, together with the Commonwealth  recovery officers, are well placed to understand disaster recovery within their communities  - bushfire or flood.

“Having visited areas impacted by bushfires and now floods, I have seen firsthand the  impacts of compounding trauma on communities,” he said.

“We will continue to support bushfire affected communities as well as provide assistance  where we can to those living with the aftermath of floods.”

Deputy Premier Barilaro said Community Recovery Officers have been based in local  councils for the past year, working extensively in bushfire impacted communities across  NSW to provide tailored local support and coordination services between government,  recovery organisations and individuals.

“The impacts of the floods and bushfires will be ongoing which is why it is crucial that we  support communities for the long term. We will continue to deliver recovery support  services for as long as they are needed,” Deputy Premier Barilaro said.

“Community Recovery Officers have been working across NSW, connecting people with  everything from rebuilding advice to mental health support and community events. This  extension will ensure they can continue assisting victims of natural disasters as the needs  of communities evolve.

“The demand for services of our 22 Community Recovery Officers is ongoing, especially  with the additional challenges of floods and COVID-19. We will be adding a 23rd  Community Recovery Officer to assist Mid-Western Regional Council for dedicated  support for the community who are experiencing complex recovery issues.”

CRO assistance is funded through the joint Commonwealth-State Disaster Recovery  Funding Arrangements (DRFA).

The Australian and NSW governments will continue to work closely together supporting  longer term recovery.
