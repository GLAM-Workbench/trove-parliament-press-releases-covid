LAGGING TOURISM SUPPORT LEAVES LIVELIHOODS IN THE BALANCE



The Morrison Government has dragged its heels on delivering much-needed support for

Australia’s tourism industry.



Today’s announcement of belated support for travel agents will be welcomed by operators who

have been battling to survive since international borders were closed in March.



But much of their pain could have been avoided if the Government had done what was needed

much sooner.



Labor has been calling on the Government to deliver a clear, industry-wide plan for survival

and recovery from the impacts of COVID-19.



Since March, Opposition MPs and Senators have been contacted by hundreds of travel agents

and have participated in numerous virtual and one-on-one meetings with business operators in

the sector.



In addition, we have made multiple representations to the Tourism Minister, Simon

Birmingham, since April highlighting their plight and encouraging the Government to take



action to support this sector.



What Australia’s tourism industry has needed throughout this crisis is leadership.



But the Morrison Government has instead offered only ad hoc announcements for certain

sectors of the industry, in most cases long after prompt action could have prevented job losses

and businesses closures.



It is well past time that travel agents received some support.



But there are other sectors of the industry that are still doing it tough.



Industry-wide, tourism has lost billions of dollars and shed more than 136,000 jobs while the

Morrison Government waited for its predicted “snap back”.



Tourism is an extremely important contributor to Australia’s economy and a major job provider.



COVID-19 and its impact are not the fault of the 300,000 odd small business owners in the

tourism sector, people who have worked hard to build their businesses and offer amazing

experiences to both domestic and international visitors.



Australian tourism operators and workers deserve a Government that doesn’t take their

livelihood for granted until it’s almost too late.
