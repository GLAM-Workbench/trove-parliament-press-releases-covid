TRANSCRIPT

INTERVIEW WITH KATIE WOOLF, MIX 104.9 DARWIN  27 August 2020





E&OE

Subjects: Australian Electoral Commission Redistribution, Northern Territory Election;

KATIE WOOLF

Joining us on the line right now is the Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack. Good morning.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Good morning.

KATIE WOOLF

Well, Deputy Prime Minister we know that -

MICHAEL McCORMACK

No, I have not ever been suspended from school, I thought that I would get that out there straight  from the outset.

KATIE WOOLF

Good to know. Good to know. Have you been suspended from the Parliament for doing anything?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, I have been thrown out of the Parliament a few times but only for speaking out for and on  behalf of regional Australians.







KATIE WOOLF

That’s alright. That’s alright. Well, you are standing up for Territorians by the sounds of it today,  putting your hand up and really adding to the voices that do believe that we need more than one  seat in the Federal Parliament. I mean, we are looking as though it could come down to the wire  here. Obviously, we've got two at the moment but we're all pretty concerned that it could go down  to one due to our declining population.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

What we need to do is make sure we put in policies that are going to increase the population first  and foremost, so that the Northern Territory in the future doesn't have to face the consequences of  Australian Electoral Commission decisions. But in the immediate future, yes, I do obviously believe  that the Northern Territory deserves two seats in the House of Representatives. Because, you know,  if COVID has taught us one thing it is that being close to government services and representation is  so important. It is such a big, big area. Some of these city metropolitan seats on the eastern  seaboard, I mean, you could throw a handkerchief over them and cover them. The Northern  Territory - I know Senator Sam McMahon, how many kilometres she drives, I mean just the other  day, she drove nearly 1500 kilometres just to touch the hearts and minds of three voters at one of  the pre-polls. Now, that's democracy and that’s Sam hard at work, but it's also the Northern  Territory, it’s the Top End and what people sometimes don't understand, who haven’t either visited  the Northern Territory and shame on them, or just don't get, you know, how difficult it is to get  around these regional seats, is that we need representation. If somebody is in Katherine or Alice  Springs, you know, they just can't easily make a decision to pop in and see the local Federal Member  when that local Federal Member is in Darwin. I come from an electorate that is 50,000 square  kilometres, I know how difficult it is sometimes to get from the top end to the bottom end of my  electorate, which is about a five hour drive, let alone in the Northern Territory where that is more a  Sunday walk in the park.

KATIE WOOLF

I mean, I guess the argument has always been and I would always say that you know, what we lack in  population we certainly make up for in things like agriculture, our cattle exports, our minerals

MICHAEL McCORMACK

You punch well above your weight, no question.

KATIE WOOLF

I understand the argument here and I understand that obviously, our population has declined, none  of us want it to continue to decline. But, you know, I guess the reality is we also need to ensure that  every Territorian’s voice is heard and it's pretty hard to do that with just one Federal Member of  Parliament.





MICHAEL McCORMACK

Look indeed and as I was campaigning the other day with Lia Finocchiaro and her Country Liberal  team - and well done to them and the effort they put in. Of course, congratulations to Michael  Gunner, for being re-elected, let's acknowledge that. When I did speak to Territorians, they were  telling me that they do want representation, they do want better representation, but they don't  want to be served by just one federal Lower House MP and I get that I understand we need a bigger  and a louder and a larger regional voice and you can't do that if you are going to reduce the number  of seats - you just can’t.

KATIE WOOLF

What needs to happen here? It seems as though we've got the support of The Nationals but  realistically, we need the Prime Minister, we need ScoMo to step up here.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Let's see where the legislation goes, let’s see what happens. Obviously, the Federal Parliament can  overturn the decision and make sure that we ratify two seats, Tasmania's had five seats as part of  the Federation. So they've had five seats and of course, they've got the twelve Senators. And of  course, they've got a State Parliament and many local councils besides and you look at the size of  Tasmania compared to the size of the Northern Territory, it is chalk and cheese really. We want to  make sure that the Northern Territory has even more voices in the Parliament, growing the  population is one thing, but in the short term, making sure that there's at least two lower house  seats I think is important.

KATIE WOOLF

And what's the best way for us to do that?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, I know that there is a private member's bill at the moment, let's see where that goes. Let's see  where it takes us. The National Party turned up and very much campaigned for the CLP, Lia and her  candidates during the recent Territory election and I know that Keith Pitt and David Littleproud and  Matt Canavan and myself were all up there and we spent quite a bit of time up there. We spoke to  the people, we listened to their concerns and their issues and certainly, we know how important the  Territories are as you mentioned agriculture and resources. We want to grow those, we want to  make sure that the regional populations of the Northern Territory and really it is one big region, one  very, very big region, we want to make sure it gets best represented and I'd like to see more  Coalition members in and fighting for the Northern Territory’s interests in Canberra. I think that's  important. So we'll get on and do what we need to do. We'll have those discussions when they need  to be held and we will certainly be in there fighting hard as Nationals for more representation for the  NT.





KATIE WOOLF

I just reckon it is so important. We talk about growing the Territory and a lot about the population,  but I think it's so important for regional Australia as well. Whether you only talk about the Northern  Territory or other parts of regional Australia to really try to get people moving to those regional  parts of Australia. When you talk about infrastructure in some of our big locations like Sydney and  Melbourne and Brisbane, it can be you know, it can certainly have pressure placed upon it due to the  high populations, we would love to see more people living in regional Australia.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Bursting at the seams. These regional centres are big enough in which to get a good cup of coffee  and they’re small enough to care. That’s why we are spending $33 billion in infrastructure over the  next decade in regional Australia. That's why I urge and encourage and I get mocked for saying it, but  there are jobs in regional Australia, good jobs, not just necessarily in resources, not just necessarily  in agriculture, but in so many fields of endeavour, I’ll keep pushing the point. I’m a regional member  myself, I love the Top End, I absolutely love it. I intend to come back to it very, very soon, as  restrictions allow. It's a great place. It is a great lifestyle. Why wouldn't people want to live in the Top  End or indeed anywhere in regional Australia?

KATIE WOOLF

And you did touch on the election, now what was your reaction to the results? Did you think that  Michael Gunner was going to get in so convincingly?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, I am not so sure that he did get in so convincingly. I mean you look at the CLP, they had two  seats in the Parliament and now they have extended that to possibly eight. I rang Josh Burgoyne just  last night to congratulate him on his election. I know Lia and her team are going to form a very  credible Opposition. I know they are really going to make sure that the Gunner Government is  accountable, is transparent and certainly works hard to bring down that debt and I know that over  the next four years, there's going to be some fierce debates in the Parliament, to ensure that the  Northern Territory can be its best self. So look, as I say, I congratulated Michael Gunner earlier in the  interview. Well done to him and his team. You put your hand up for public office and when you  succeed and get re-elected, that deserves acknowledgement. And I know I'll be certainly working  with Eva Lawler and others to bring about the infrastructure needs that the Northern Territory  absolutely needs, wants, expects and most of all deserves. So, I'm happy to work with any State or  Territory Government of any political persuasion, to get infrastructure built because it's not about  politics. It's got to be about people. That's what I've always said. That's how I've lived my political life  and that's how I'll continue to do it as well.











KATIE WOOLF

Well, Michael McCormack, talking about politics. I do notice in The Australian though that that there  is an article here saying that there's some destabilisation or a campaign led by some senior National  MPs and party figures -

MICHAEL McCORMACK

You cannot believe everything you read, Katie, come on.

KATIE WOOLF

Rivals laying the groundwork for a leadership transition after the Queensland election. What's going  on?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Look, you're always going to have ambitious people. You're going to have ambitious journalists who  write things, quote anonymous people, unsubstantiated gossip. I mean this is Canberra bubble stuff.  Honestly, I am just getting on in the middle of a global pandemic with representing what people  want me to be talking about. And that is their jobs, their security their future. I think the last thing  people, particularly people in regional areas, who are wearing their heart on their sleeve, who are  doing it disproportionately tough at the moment because of outbreaks in metropolitan areas and  particularly Melbourne and are in lockdown and we're being told to stay inside and our businesses  are shutting. Thank goodness for JobKeeper, they’re keeping the lights on and many doors open as  we can and workers connected to their employment. But the last thing people want to see is  politicians talking about themselves and I am not going to engage in that.

KATIE WOOLF

So, no niggling in the backgrounds by the likes of David Littleproud?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Nope.

KATIE WOOLF

Bridget McKenzie?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Nope.







KATIE WOOLF

Matt Canavan?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Nope.

KATIE WOOLF

Well, I'm glad to hear, it is always good to talk to you, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack.  We appreciate your time this morning.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Any time at all, Katie, I'll continue to fight for the Top End as will Sam McMahon down here in  Canberra.

KATIE WOOLF

Thank you.
