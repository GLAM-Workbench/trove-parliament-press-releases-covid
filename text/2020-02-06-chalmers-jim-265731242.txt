RETAIL TRADE PLUNGES

New data out today shows that retail trade plunged by 0.5 per cent in December and  annual growth in retail values and volumes is weak.

Another big drop in the retail sales data is more evidence that Australians are struggling  with stagnant wages, record levels of household debt, and skyrocketing bills on Scott  Morrison and Josh Frydenberg’s watch.

Today’s figures come just one day after the Reserve Bank highlighted that household  spending has been constrained by protracted weak wages growth which looks set to  continue.

Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg shouldn’t be using the fires and coronavirus as an  excuse for their long-standing failures on the economy.

The economy was weak before the fires and before the virus hit.

Because of the Morrison Government’s economic failures, Australia meets the serious  challenges and uncertainties of the fire season and the Coronavirus outbreak from a  position of weakness, not strength.
