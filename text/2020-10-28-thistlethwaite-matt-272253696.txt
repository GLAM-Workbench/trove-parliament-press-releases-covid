E&OE TRANSCRIPT

DOORSTOP INTERVIEW

PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA

WEDNESDAY, 28 OCTOBER 2020



SUBJECTS: Banking Royal Commission; ASIC.



MATT THISTLETHWAITE, SHADOW ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FINANCIAL

SERVICES: Good morning. The Morrison government are as shallow as a bird bath. It

looks good on the water, but there’s not much going on below the surface. And a classic

example of this is in financial services. It’s almost two years since the Banking and

Financial Services Royal Commission handed down its recommendations, yet 10 of the 76

recommendations have only been implemented by this government. Three quarters of

those important recommendations to fix financial services in this country have not been

dealt with by the Morrison government and they include important reforms such as anti-hawking provisions around insurance and superannuation.



Now we all understand the economy has been affected by Covid, but that hasn’t stopped

the banks and financial services institutions from selling products and Australians are

susceptible to being ripped off by unscrupulous providers during this time, but the

government still refuses to act.



And then we’ve seen over recent days the chaos that’s been occurring in the regulators

who’s job it is to police financial services in this country and ensure that Australians aren’t

being ripped off with their finances and superannuation. And it appears that the Chair and

the Deputy Chair of ASIC are more interested in their personal finances rather than

protecting the finances of the Australian people and that’s simply not acceptable. It’s been

uncovered in Estimates that the ANAO raised these issues about these payments that



were made to the Chair and the Deputy Chair of ASIC over 12 months ago, but they

weren’t disclosed to the board. We also know that the Treasurer knew about this a month

ago, but hasn’t disclosed it to the Australian people.



What’s gone in financial services under this government is a travesty and the people of

Australia are suffering. And this government needs to refocus on ensuring that they’re

delivering the recommendations from the Royal Commission and protecting the finances of

the Australian people. Thank you.
