MEDIA RELEASE  DISABILITY SUPPORT PENSION

Mean spirited Government overlooks disabled people's need for support  once again

The Greens say it's disgraceful and another slap in the face to disabled people  that the Government is not going to index the disability support pension this  year.

"Disabled people feel they have been abandoned by this Government and are  desperate for extra support, particularly those in Victoria", Greens  spokesperson on Family and Community Services Senator Rachel Siewert  said.

Disabled people and carers have been doing it extremely tough through this  COVID pandemic without enough support to assist them with the higher costs  they've been facing for groceries, transport and access to essential supports  and medical supplies. This has increased anxiety levels.

People on the Disability Support Pension and Carer Payment are facing  additional costs due to coronavirus that are not adequately met by the $750  economic stimulus payments.

It makes zero sense that they are not getting the COVID supplement despite it  being very clear that their costs have increased due to this pandemic.

The Government cannot say they don’t know this, they are just choosing to  ignore it..

It’s ridiculous to say that pensions will not get their usual increase because CPI  has not increased. Pension rates are set by many measures, not just CPI.

A responsible Government would be planning to give more assistance to  communities who are more impacted by this pandemic, not taking away support  with mean spirit penny pinching.
