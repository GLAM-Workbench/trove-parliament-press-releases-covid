AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE INDUSTRY FUNDING SUPPORT

The Morrison Government has awarded more than $11 million in grants to 20 Australian small businesses as part of a program that will enhance Australia’s sovereign defence industry.

Minister for Defence Industry Melissa Price said the latest funding support awarded through the Sovereign Industrial Capability Grants Program will also boost innovation and investment in Australian Defence Force capability.

“These grants make a vital contribution to growing Australia’s sovereign defence industrial base,” Minister Price said.

“The Morrison Government is committed to safeguarding the livelihoods of all Australians, including small businesses within the defence sector.”

The Sovereign Industrial Capability Grants Program helps drive innovation in small businesses and make them more competitive, especially in the face of COVID-19 challenges.

“This funding will allow for even greater cooperation and innovation activities across industry and with Defence.” Minister Price said.

“For example, WA-based Franmarine Underwater Services is contributing to our Naval Shipbuilding Enterprise by establishing a new facility to better support underwater maintenance activities.

“Franmarine’s investment will improve the effectiveness and speed of maintenance activities, helping keep our critical naval vessels available for deployment,” Minister Price said.

Grant applications can be made at any time and can be submitted through the Centre for Defence Industry Capability.
