Event grants to boost regional tourism

The Morrison Government has today announced $245,000 in funding for 10 new events and  projects in fire-affected regions in South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales  to support the communities in response to the summer bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is the second round of funding announced under the $10 million Regional Tourism Bushfire  Recovery Grants program, and follows $580,000 of funding announced for 24 events and  projects in June.

The grants program is part of a $76 million tourism bushfire recovery package to protect jobs,  small businesses and local economies.

Assistant Minister for Regional Tourism JONNO DUNIAM said the events, including a vintage  motoring run, art trail, cycling event, concert and food festival, would assist in boosting the  number of domestic visitors to our regional areas when the time was right.

“With restrictions easing in some states and planning for events starting again, it’s great to be  able to announce the latest round of grants that will help to breathe life back into our regional  tourism industry,” Assistant Minister Duniam said.

“These community events and projects are all about encouraging Australians back into our  regions, to keep struggling tourism businesses alive by putting dollars back into the hands of  local vendors and operators.

“Each year, Australia attracts close to nine million international arrivals and with no immediate  return to international travel in sight, it’s more important than ever that Australians support  regional tourism and enjoy the best of what we have in our own backyard.

“This year has been as tough as it gets for so many of our regional communities that  have been hit hard by the combined impact of bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This is not only an opportunity to give visitors a new reason to visit our regions, it is an  important chance for communities to come together and focus on something positive  and to celebrate what’s unique about their region.

“I’m urging all Aussies to consider taking a holiday right here, when it’s safe to do so -  you’ll be doing yourself and the locals a huge favour.”
