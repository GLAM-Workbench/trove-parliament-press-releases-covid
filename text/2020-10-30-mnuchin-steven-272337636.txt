JOINT CALL OF FINANCE MINISTERS

On 29 October (AEDT), Chancellor Rishi Sunak hosted a call with “Five Eyes” nations Finance  Ministers from Australia, Canada and the United States.

The Ministers discussed national economic coronavirus support measures and the steps we’ve taken  to protect, create, and support jobs.

Ministers also shared updates on policy responses currently in place and discussed strategies to  continue supporting jobs and helping to contain the virus in the difficult months ahead.

We agreed to remain in regular contact as a group and will continue to work together to support a  strong and sustained economic recovery.

In light of their recent election, New Zealand representatives sent their apologies.
