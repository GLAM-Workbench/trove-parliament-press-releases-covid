$15.1 million to support this year’s   Royal Easter Show

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $15.1 million under the Supporting Agricultural Shows and Field Days program  to help this year’s Sydney Royal Easter Show go ahead

The Australian Government has provided $15.1 million to the Sydney Royal Easter Show  under the Supporting Agricultural Shows and Field Days program to relieve cash flow  pressures and ensure this year’s Show could go ahead.

Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management, David Littleproud said  Agricultural shows and field days contribute over $1 billion to the economy each year.

“Agricultural shows are an integral part of Australian culture and the most authentic and  accessible display of Australian farming and regional life,” Minister Littleproud said.

“They attract more than 6 million patrons, a lot of who are from regional and remote  communities and are supported by more than 50,000 volunteers.

“Today I am visiting the Sydney Royal Easter Show, which had to cancel in 2020 due to  COVID-19. After the financial turmoil caused by the cancellation it is great to see the event  go ahead in 2021 with the support of the Australian Government.

“The Sydney Royal Easter Show generates $250 million in economic activity each year, a  lot of which flows to agricultural industries and regional and rural communities.

“I am thrilled to see the huge numbers of people coming through the gates this Easter  weekend to support the event.

“The Sydney Royal Easter Show continues to bring the best of the bush to the city and  showcase our incredible Australian produce and innovations.

“It survived the 1919 Spanish Flu pandemic, the Great Depression, World War Two, and  has now survived coronavirus to come back as big, bold and exciting as ever in 2021.”
