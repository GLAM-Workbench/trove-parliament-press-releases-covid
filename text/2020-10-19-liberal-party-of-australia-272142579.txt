More job-ready graduates from next year

More Australians will get the opportunity to study for a university degree from next year, with  more support for students from regional and rural Australia after the Morrison Government’s  Job-ready Graduates legislation passed today.

Starting next year:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ There will be more university places for Australian students, growing to 100,000  additional places in ten years.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Regional students and regional universities will benefit from additional support worth

more than $400 million, including access to a $5,000 scholarship to help with  relocation costs.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Students will pay less to study in areas of expected future job demand, with  discounted fees for teaching, nursing, clinical psychology, English and languages,

agriculture, maths, science, health, architecture, environmental science, IT and  engineering.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A $900 million National Priorities and Industry Linkage Fund will support universities  to work with local industry to produce job-ready graduates.

Minister for Education Dan Tehan said the Job-ready Graduates package was part of the  Government’s plan for education to help drive Australia’s recovery from COVID-19.

“The Job-ready Graduates package is focused on Australian students. It will create more  places at university for more Australians and it will lower the cost of subjects for students  who study in areas of expected job growth,” Mr Tehan said.

“Australia will need more science, technology, engineering and mathematics skilled workers  to help drive our economic recovery and there will be more jobs that rely on those skills.

“In this year’s budget we provided $550 million for 12,000 extra university places and 50,000  short course places plus an additional $1 billion for university research as part of our plan for  education.

“This means, from next year, up to 30,000 more Australians will get the opportunity to benefit  from a higher education.

“Our reforms will ensure more Australians from regional and rural areas get the opportunity  of a university education and are supported to succeed.

“The newly created National Priorities and Industry Linkage Fund will drive universities to be  more responsive to the needs of Australian businesses and to design education that helps  prepare students for the jobs of the future.

“The Bill also provides more money and more certainty for universities. University funding  will grow by $2 billion to 2024 and the Bill locks in indexation at pre-COVID rates for the next  three years.”
