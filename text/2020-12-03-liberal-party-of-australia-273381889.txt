Long-term strategy for international education

The Morrison Government will work with the education sector to develop a long-term plan for  international education.

The Council for International Education met today in Canberra. The Council consists of six  Morrison Government ministers with relevant portfolio responsibilities and international  education experts and practitioners.

Minister for Education Dan Tehan said: “At today’s meeting it was agreed that Australia must  be ready to seize future opportunities by developing a new Strategy for International  Education to chart a path for the international education sector for the next 10 years across  education, research and training.

“We must be prepared for more focus on offshore, online and blended learning, and a  growth in new models of delivery - such as micro-credentials.

“In 2019, Australia hosted more than 750,000 international students, which generated over  $40.3 billion in export revenue, and supported nearly 250,000 jobs nationally.

“While COVID-19 has caused significant disruption to our international education sector,  Australia remains a destination of choice for international students because of the   high-quality of the education and lifestyle we offer, combined with our strong health response  to the pandemic.

“Australia’s latest economic data and the development of COVID vaccines are further  reasons to be optimistic about the future of international education.”

The communique from the Council’s fifth meeting is available here.
