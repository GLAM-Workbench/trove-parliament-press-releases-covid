MORRISON GOVERNMENT FAILING AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURING



After seven years of inaction from this Government, calls from industry are intensifying for

a revitalised manufacturing sector.



In a report today, Andrew Liveris, special advisor to the Government’s own National

COVID-19 Coordination Commission, has exposed the Morrison Government’s deficient

manufacturing plan.



Mr Liveris highlighted the chasm we see under the Morrison Government between

announcement and delivery, commenting:



“We’ve chopped and changed so much… we’ve just got to get to the actual decision and

doing part of it.”



It shouldn’t take a recession for the Morrison Government to start talking about the

importance of Australian manufacturing. Now it’s time to match words with action.



Under the Morrison government there is no comprehensive plan for industry policy or

manufacturing.



The only plan the Morrison Government currently has for R&D is to rip almost $2 billion

from the Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI).



A number of business leaders and experts have raised concerns about Australia’s

research and development capacity, which is inextricably linked to a recovery led by



advanced manufacturing.



Australia has always been a nation that makes things, but this ability is shrinking as the

manufacturing sector has been contracting not growing under a government that goaded

car manufacturers to leave our shores.



Morrison Government must do more to support the Australian manufacturing sector. They

need to come up with a genuine plan to get the economy moving again.
