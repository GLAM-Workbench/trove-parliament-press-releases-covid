6 October 2020  Pensioners respond to Budget 2020: aged care, retirement

income, housing

The following comments are attributable to CPSA Policy Manager, Paul Versteege:

Aged care

This Budget provides 23,000 new home care packages over the forward estimates. The  number of people waiting without an interim, lower-level package is 59,000 as per 31  March 2020. This is an obvious shortfall and will mean 33,000 people entitled to home care  will not get it for the next four years.

There does not appear to a recognition on the part of the Australian Government that not  providing age care to somebody who needs it is an inexcusable aged care quality and  safety failure.

CPSA welcomes Budget allocations for various measures in residential aged care.

Retirement income

CPSA welcomes the two one-off payment of $250 in December and May for pensioners  and holders of the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card.

It is disappointing that this Budget does not commit to a permanently increased JobSeeker  payment. For many, JobSeeker has become a Pre-Age Pension. Before COVID-19, there  were 196,000 people over 55 on unemployment benefits. The chance of them finding  employment was low then, but now there are 318,000 people over 55 on unemployment  benefits, an increase of more than 60 per cent.

As it stands, the Australian Government will remove the COVID-19 supplement at year  end. JobSeeker without the COVID-19 supplement is $565.70 per fortnight. That's almost

40 per cent less than the pension ($933.40 a fortnight).

People over 55 have plenty to offer and will mostly live another 25 to 30 years. They  should not be relegated to permanent unemployment and mutual obligation 'volunteer'  work. They need jobs! It is disappointing that this budget makes no attempt to get the over-55s back into work.

Housing

It is disappointing that JobMaker, the Budget's focus on economic stimulus through  infrastructure, does not include social housing. Three-quarter of a million new social  housing units are required over the next twenty years, an average of 37,000 a year.  Currently Australia is achieving about 5,000 new units annually.

The shortfall in social housing construction is already playing havoc with housing security.  Homelessness is on the rise. The failure of the Australian Government to invest in social  housing at levels to cope with demand is scandalous.

The capital gains tax exemption for granny flats is a welcome initiative, and the  requirement for this to be formally documented and agreed in order to prevent disputes  and reduce the likelihood of elder abuse is thoughtful.
