MEDIA RELEASE  HIGH COMMISSIONER TO SINGAPORE

Today I announce the appointment of the Hon William Hodgman as Australia’s next High  Commissioner to Singapore.

Australia’s deep and longstanding ties with Singapore are underpinned by a Comprehensive  Strategic Partnership covering defence, trade, science and innovation, the digital economy and  people-to-people links. We have shared interests in the strategic stability and economic  prosperity of our region, and work together as like-minded partners to foster these interests.

Singapore is Australia's largest trade and investment partner in ASEAN and our sixth largest  trading partner. We look forward to growing our relationship in priority areas, and continuing our  nations’ work together in responding to the health and economic challenges of the COVID-19  pandemic.

Mr Hodgman was most recently the Inaugural Chair of the Australian Business Growth Fund.  He has previously served as the Premier of Tasmania; held various Ministerial positions  including Attorney-General of Tasmania, Minister for Justice, Tourism, Hospitality and Events,  Trade, Prevention of Family Violence, Advanced Manufacturing and Defence Industries, Parks,  Heritage, Sport and Recreation, the Arts and Aboriginal Affairs; Leader of the Opposition;  Liberal Member of the Parliament of Tasmania; and practised law in various roles.

Mr Hodgman holds a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Tasmania.  He was admitted as a Barrister and Solicitor and became a Practitioner of the High Court of  Australia in 1994.

I thank outgoing High Commissioner Bruce Gosper for his contributions to advancing Australia’s  interests in Singapore since 2017.
