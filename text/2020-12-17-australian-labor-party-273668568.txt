MORRISON GOVERNMENT MUST RELEASE REPORTS INTO ST BASIL’S

AND EPPING GARDENS COVID OUTBREAKS



The Morrison Government must immediately release independent reports it

commissioned into outbreaks of COVID-19 in St Basil’s and Epping Gardens aged

care homes.



Why aren’t these reports being made public immediately when we know the tragic

risks of COVID-19 in aged care? What is the Morrison Government hiding?



Families who lost loved ones in these aged care homes deserve answers.



It is vitally important that all aged care providers across the country have the

benefit of these reviews so lessons can be learnt and applied.



We have seen the devastating consequences of the Morrison Government’s failure

to not prepare our aged care system for COVID-19.



Some families and loved ones were forced to say goodbye over FaceTime.



Ants have been found crawling from wounds, with residents left to languish without

care.



All because the Morrison Government failed to have a proper plan for COVID-19 in



aged care.



Australians must be assured the Morrison Government has learnt from its previous

failings in aged care.



It’s not good enough that the Morrison Government hasn’t been more transparent

about these reports and other reviews into previous outbreaks of COVID-19 in

aged care.
