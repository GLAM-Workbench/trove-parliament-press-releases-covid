Fruit and vegetable supply secured during Coronavirus  KENNEDY MP, Bob Katter has welcomed the Federal Government’s swift action to  secure the essential supply of fruit and vegetables with the extension of backpacker  and farmworker visas up to a year, as well as the many recently unemployed North  Queenslanders who have put their shoulder to the wheel and taken up work in the  packing sheds.

“I thank everyone for their support for this breakthrough including the ministers I’ve  spoken to this week, as well as the many North Queensland farmers and industry  bodies who brought this matter to our attention,” Mr Katter said.

“A lot of people who’ve been out of work have applied for jobs on our farms. We  thank them for making themselves available to work in the packing sheds; ensuring  Australia’s food security during this pandemic.

“There is work available and I am glad people are stepping up to do their bit. I don’t  advocate compulsion and it looks like it won’t be necessary due to the willingness of  these people.”

In a bid to protect regional communities from Coronavirus, the Federal Government  has also announced that these workers will also have to self-isolate for 14 days  before they start working.

“It is essential now that we keep the packing sheds Coronavirus free and that all  workers and farmers abide by the new quarantine measurers,” Mr Katter said.
