NEW RESEARCH SLAMS MORRISON GOVERNMENT’S AGED CARE

SECRECY



New research commissioned by the Aged Care Royal Commission has slammed the

Morrison Government’s lack of transparency on aged care funding.



Despite billions of dollars being poured into aged care, Australians are in the dark about

where taxpayer funding is going.



“An independent report on aged care providers' financial information says that there is

insufficient financial transparency about the use of funds from Government and people in

care, which in 2018-19 totalled approximately $25 billion.”

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ MEDIA RELEASE, ROYAL COMMISSION INTO AGED CARE QUALITY AND

SAFETY, 9 SEPTEMBER 2020

This secrecy is exactly why Labor’s 8-point plan for aged care called on the Government to

ensure transparency of funding.



It’s not good enough that Australians are in the dark on how taxpayer money is spent.



Labor has said for a long time there needs to be more transparency and accountability for

the public funding that is in the aged care system.



Any money going into aged care needs to have full transparency so it's improving the care

of older Australians.



The Morrison Government opposes aged care transparency at every turn.





The Morrison Government continues to hide data about older Australians who have

tragically passed away from COVID-19 in aged care homes.



It refuses to be honest about which aged care homes have been impacted by COVID-19,

and how many cases and deaths have occurred at each facility.



The Morrison Government has repeatedly delayed the release of data on the number of

older Australians languishing on the waiting list for home care.



Day after day the evidence mounts of serious neglect in aged care homes and every day

all we see from the Morrison Government is running away, passing the buck and not

accepting responsibility for its own failures.



Neglect. That’s the legacy of this Government when it comes to aged care.



Australians deserve better on aged care- they deserve honesty.
