CHRIS BOWEN MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR HEALTH  MEMBER FOR MCMAHON

COVID-19 TESTING MUST BE INCREASED TO REDUCE IMPACT OF  VIRUS

Labor is increasingly concerned that insufficient testing for COVID-19 is being  conducted in Australia.

Today Labor echoes calls made previously to the Government to address  testing shortages, and to test as many Australians with COVID-19 symptoms as  possible.

The Government should do everything in their power to ensure every  suspected case is tested based on ‘symptoms or contact’ not ‘symptoms and  contact’.

The Government has acknowledged that their recommendations on testing are  constrained by the availability of tests. Australia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer  Paul Kelly said only two days ago “if we had unlimited amounts of tests, we  could do other things”.

Testing should not be determined by the number of tests available. Testing  should be determined by the number of people who need it.

Labor understands there are global shortages, but we also understand  that countries who have tested in abundance have managed to prevent mass  outbreaks or bring them under control, like in South Korea. These countries  continue to test anyone with symptoms or close contact with confirmed cases.

The Director General of the World Health Organisation said only on Monday:

“We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test. Test every  suspected case.”

Currently in Australia you will only be tested if your doctor decides you meet the

criteria:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ You have returned from overseas in the past 14 days and you develop  respiratory illness with or without fever  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ You have been in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the  past 14 days and you develop respiratory illness with or without fever  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ You have severe community-acquired pneumonia and there is no clear

cause

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ You are a healthcare worker who works directly with patients and you  have a respiratory illness and a fever

Labor respects that the Government have this week imported more tests to  increase capacity and that assert they will continue to address this as an issue.

But they must do more.

The spread of the virus and health of every Australian depends on it.
