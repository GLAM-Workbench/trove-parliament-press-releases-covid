CONSTRUCTION STARTS ON FIRST PINCHPOINT PROGRAM PROJECT

Construction has started today on a new northbound lane on Devlin Street between  Victoria and Blaxland roads in Ryde that will bust congestion for local motorists.

The Devlin Street project is the first of 11 projects being delivered through the Pinch  Point Program across Sydney, to get people home sooner and safer.

The program is part of the Morrison Government’s $451 million commitment to New  South Wales to support priority, shovel-ready projects for an immediate economic boost  into the economy in response to COVID-19.

Federal Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure Alan Tudge said 1000  jobs will be supported across the Pinch Point Program.

“Not only are we addressing the very immediate needs of local motorists, but we’re  creating jobs and getting cracking on projects that are shovel ready,” Mr Tudge said.

“Projects funded through our Pinch Point Program will make a very real difference to  people in their day to day lives.”

NSW Minister for Transport and Roads Andrew Constance said the NSW Government is  contributing $569 million in funding to improve the state’s road network, bringing the joint  commitment to $1.02 billion.

“Ryde is a rapidly growing residential, commercial and shopping district and the Devlin  Street works would cater to this,” Mr Constance said.

“The addition of another northbound lane will expand Devlin Street to four through-lanes,  reducing delays for the more than 65,000 drivers who travel through the intersection  every day,” Mr Constance said.

Federal Member for Bennelong John Alexander said Devlin Street was a key local  transport corridor.

“The works will greatly assist the movement of people and goods within Sydney’s  northern suburbs which is great for businesses, families and the local economy,”  Mr Alexander said.

“The upgrade includes improvements to retaining walls, upgrading streetlight and  overhead signage, adjusting pedestrian fencing, and road resurfacing on Devlin Street.”

New South Wales Member for Ryde Victor Dominello said the new road works would be  a big win for the community.

“This investment will help ease congestion and make life easier for residents and  visitors,” Mr Dominello said.

“More and more families are calling Ryde home and it is important that we deliver critical  infrastructure to cater for our growing community.”

The Australian and NSW governments are jointly funding the works to support economic  growth, job creation and road safety and to reduce congestion on Sydney roads.

Works are due to be completed by late 2022.
