TIME TO CRACK DOWN ON PAYDAY LENDING



Independent Member for Clark, Andrew Wilkie, will introduce the National Consumer  Credit Protection Amendment (Small Amount Credit Contract and Consumer Lease Reforms)  Bill 2020. The bill will provide better protections for consumers from dodgy payday lenders  and rent-to-buy schemes.

WHEN: Approximately 10:10am TODAY 30 November 2020  WHERE: House of Representatives (watch live at  https://www.aph.gov.au/news_and_events/watch_parliament)  “Many people end up in financial strife through these schemes,” Mr Wilkie said. “Those who  peddle them prey on the most vulnerable members of society, many who have ended up with  less money and increased debt due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Take the example of the single mother of three who began gambling online with funds she  obtained from eight different online payday lenders. When she was eventually cut off from  one provider, she was contacted out of the blue by another. This vicious cycle is hard to  break and has pushed this poor woman into dire financial straits and homelessness.

“This bill is a replica of the Government’s Exposure Draft of 2017, which would have  cleaned up the industry and provided better protections to vulnerable consumers. It’s  unfortunate that the Government kowtowed to the pressure from the payday lending industry  in 2017 and didn’t progress their bill.

“The time to act is now. As JobSeeker and JobKeeper are wound back, the number of people  seeking these loans will only increase. The Government must put people over profits and  support this bill to protect consumers.”
