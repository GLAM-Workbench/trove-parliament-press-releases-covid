GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO STAND ALONGSIDE AUSTRALIANS  THROUGH CHALLENGING YEAR

This year, the Morrison Government’s legislative agenda has allowed us to swiftly respond to  the health and economic crisis, as well as keep Australians safe and deliver the essential  services we rely on.

Our health and economic response to the COVID-19 has placed us in a better position than  most other countries in the world. Our economic recovery plan is being implemented and  Australians are getting back to work with 650,000 jobs created in the last five months.

Our legislative agenda has helped navigate Australia through a year like no other, has kept  Australians safe and means our economic recovery is now underway.

JobKeeper, Jobseeker Coronavirus Supplement, the Cash Flow Boost, two $750 payments to  millions of pensioners and others on income support, have all helped cushion the blow and  build the bridge to the other side of this crisis.

JobKeeper, the single largest support measure ever introduced by an Australian Government,  has helped to keep workers in jobs or connected to their jobs and keep businesses in business  during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We also increased benefits for those out of work through the introduction of the Coronavirus  supplement, which was extended until the end of March in this Parliamentary fortnight.

Households and businesses also benefited from tax relief, with Stage Two of our Personal  Income Tax Plan brought forward by two years and the company tax rate for small and  family businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million reduced from 27.5 per cent to 26  per cent.

In the final parliamentary session, we passed 46 Bills through the Parliament, allowing our  economic recovery to continue into 2021 as we build a stronger and safer Australia.
