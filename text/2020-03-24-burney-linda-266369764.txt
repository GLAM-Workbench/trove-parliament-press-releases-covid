LABOR SECURES STIMULUS CHANGES FOR STUDENTS

Students will now be able to access the Coronavirus Supplement after Labor secured  changes from the Government late last night.

230,000 full-time students who receive Youth Allowance, Austudy and Absudy will receive  the $550 per fortnight boost to their payments.

Yesterday, Labor wrote to the Minister for Families and Social Services Senator Anne  Ruston calling for the changes to be made.

Students who lose their job or have their hours significantly reduced - their budgets will be  impacted in the same way as other working age social security recipients.

The reality is Coronavirus does not distinguish between the various categories of those  who need help.

Our social safety net should remain as flexible as possible to meet this great challenge  ahead.

Labor worked with student and community groups to secure the changes.

Labor also expressed concern about the payments only being available from 27 April - in  five weeksâ€™ time - and asked the Government to bring forward the payments on an urgent  basis.

Our social safety net should be there for anyone who needs it, particularly as we face the  health and economic consequences of the Coronavirus pandemic.
