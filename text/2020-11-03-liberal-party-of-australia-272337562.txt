Investing in early career researchers

The Morrison Government is investing $84 million in early career researchers as part of our  plan to help drive Australia’s economic recovery.

Minister for Education Dan Tehan today announced funding for 200 research projects in the  national interest led by young Australian researchers under the Australian Research  Council’s (ARC) Discovery Early Career Researcher Award scheme.

Minister for Education Dan Tehan said 72 per cent of the funded research was in the fields  of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

“Our Government is funding our smartest researchers to tackle the problems that will  improve our lives, grow our economy and generate new knowledge,” Mr Tehan said.

“For example, 72 per cent of bridges in Australia were built before 1976 so a cheap, safe  way to test bridge integrity will lead to safer travel for all Australians and lower maintenance  costs.

“These research projects are part of our Government’s plan to invest in ideas and innovation  to help power Australia’s economic recovery from COVID-19.

“This investment in research will complement the additional $1 billion for university research  and $157 million for research infrastructure announced in the 2020 Budget.

“The Budget also provides $5.8 million to design a scheme to accelerate turning university  research into new products, job creation, productivity gains and economic growth.

“The $900 million Industry Linkage Fund, created as part of the Job-ready Graduates  package, will incentivise university engagement with industry and focus on creating more  STEM-skilled and job-ready graduates in areas of industry and community priority.

“Our Government is investing in research that’s in the national interest and we have a plan to  turn that research into jobs, productivity gains and economic growth as part of our economic  recovery from COVID-19.”

Funded projects include:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $351,948 to develop a new approach to fire management in the wake of bushfires  that will lead to improved governance and policy in bushfire management to better  protect communities and save lives (University of Western Australia).

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $430,075 to develop a low-cost and robust bridge monitoring framework using  advanced data analytics, solely based on the response of a moving vehicle passing  over the bridge that will open a new direction for sustainable monitoring of ageing  infrastructure (University of New South Wales).
