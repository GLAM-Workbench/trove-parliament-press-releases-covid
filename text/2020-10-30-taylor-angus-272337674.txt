BP KWINANA REFINERY



The Australian Government is deeply disappointed by BP’s decision to close its Kwinana  Refinery in Western Australia after 65 years of operation.

The Kwinana Refinery directly employs around 650 staff and is an important contributor  to the local economy.

Our thoughts are with BP’s workers, their families and local business owners who rely  on the refinery for their livelihoods.

The Australian Government expects BP to deliver on its commitment to do everything it  can to support workers through this challenging period.

We will work with BP and the Western Australian Government to ensure workers and  the community are supported.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to place immense pressure on refineries world-wide,  with demand for fuel products significantly reduced.

As BP has made clear, its decision to close the refinery was based on commercial and  international factors, including the age of the refinery and overseas competition.

Closure of the refinery will not negatively impact Australian fuel supplies.

The Government is providing support to the domestic refining sector through the  JobKeeper program to maintain operations and support jobs.

Our comprehensive Fuel Security Package, announced in the 2020-21 Budget, will  enhance Australia’s long-term fuel supply.

We will ensure Australia maintains a sovereign refining capability to support local  industry, meet our nation’s needs during an emergency, and protect motorists from  future higher prices.
