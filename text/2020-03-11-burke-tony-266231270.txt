WHAT PLANET DOES CHRISTIAN PORTER LIVE ON?

Christian Porter is completely out of touch with the reality of casual and gig work in  Australia.

Does this Minister honestly believe casuals - many of whom are low-paid and in insecure  jobs with unpredictable hours - have put aside money in case of a global pandemic?

"Many people would have already made provisions for that because of course the purpose  of casual employment is that you're paid extra in lieu of entitlements” - Porter, ABC News,  10 March.

This is Porter’s “poor people don’t drive cars” moment. He is completely delusional.

Doesn’t he realise wages have flatlined under his Government?

Doesn’t he realise many casuals live from payday to payday?

Doesn’t he realise casual loadings were never meant to apply to precautionary self-isolation?

Has he ever even spoken with a cleaner, or a waiter, or a retail server who needs to work  every hour they can just to pay the bills and put food on the table?

If casuals aren’t given support through this crisis we run the very real risk they will turn up  to work when they’re sick because they simply cannot afford to stay home and lose their  pay.

This isn’t just about supporting Australia’s 3.3 million casuals - it’s about containing the  spread of coronavirus.

The Government must address this issue with its stimulus package on Thursday.
