E&OE TRANSCRIPT

DOORSTOP INTERVIEW

PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA

THURSDAY, 22 OCTOBER 2020



SUBJECT: National Integrity Commission.



TANYA PLIBERSEK, SHADOW MINISTER FOR EDUCATION AND

TRAINING:  Yesterday Scott Morrison used COVID-19 as an excuse for not establishing a

national integrity commission. But we also found out that at the height of the pandemic, the

government has established an integrity unit for students, in Melbourne, in the height of the

pandemic.



The simple fact is Scott Morrison doesn't want a national integrity commission because

he's got no integrity. Think about the scandals that this Government has presided over.

Sports rorts. Water buy backs. Dodgy land deals around the airport. Forged documents.

Branch stacking.



If Scott Morrison had wanted to act on a national integrity commission, he could have done

so by now. The simple fact is it doesn't want a national integrity commission because he's

got no integrity. This is another COVID cover up.
