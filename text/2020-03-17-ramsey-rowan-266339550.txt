First Coronavirus Clinics Open in Grey

Two coronavirus clinics will open in the Upper Spencer Gulf tomorrow in preparation for a likely  increase in the number of people needing to be tested for the virus.

Federal Member for Grey Rowan Ramsey has welcomed the announcement that clinics at Port  Augusta and Whyalla will open Wednesday, March 18, thanks to a 50 per cent funding agreement  with the Federal and State Governments.

“At this stage we do not have any identified cases of the virus in Grey, but it seems inevitable we  will have,” Mr Ramsey said.

“The opening of these clinics is a first step, but if more are required - all issues related to the  spread of the coronavirus are being reviewed regularly throughout the days.”

Mr Ramsey said while this service is now available it’s important that people understand they need  to contact their local GP first, who will arrange an appointment if neccessary.

“At this stage it’s likely most GPs will only send you for a test if you’re experiencing flu or cold like  symptoms and have recently returned from overseas, or have been in direct contact with someone  who is known to have contracted the virus,” Mr Ramsey said.

The Whyalla Hospital Clinic will be located at the Wood Terrace entrance, opposite Roberts Terrace  in the drive-through ramp area. It will operate Monday to Friday 12-3pm. Consumers are to stay in  their vehicles unless directed to exit by healthcare staff.

The Port Augusta Clinic will be located behind the hospital administration building, accessed via  Giles Street entrance. It will operate Monday to Friday 1-3pm.

Those using these clinics are to remain in their vehicles unless directed to exit by healthcare staff.

If unsure about what to do at any time, call the Coronavirus Information Line on 1800 020 080.
