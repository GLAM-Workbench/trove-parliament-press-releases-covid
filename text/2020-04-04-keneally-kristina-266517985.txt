SUPPORT FOR TEMPORARY VISA HOLDERS AND MIGRANT WORKERS

IN AUSTRALIA



After first writing to the Government on 20 March about the impact of

coronavirus on temporary visa holders and migrant workers in Australia, Labor

welcomes changes to the visa system announced today.



This includes sensible measures for backpackers working in Australia to extend

their visas and flexibility for those on skilled temporary visas being faced with

changes to their employment.



All temporary workers pay tax and contribute to the Australian economy - they

are even helping fight coronavirus with 8,000 skilled medical professionals on

temporary visas working on the frontline.



The Government has implemented Labor’s calls to relax the requirements for

fully qualified nurses in Australia on working holiday maker (WHM) visas to be

able to continue working in hospitals rather than being forced to meet visa

requirements - such as completing “specified work” often picking fruit.



We support temporary visa holders having early access to their superannuation

given the large number of people involved. This is a fair and equitable

proposition in the absence of any other means for their support.



Whilst today’s announcements cover some temporary visa holders and migrant

workers in Australia, it doesn’t cover them all. Labor will continue to suggest

changes that need to be made in the national effort to reduce the spread of the

coronavirus.



Labor remains concerned for the hundreds of thousands of temporary visa

holders in Australia who are trapped here, who can’t go home, and are being

forced out of their accommodation.



A virus does not check a person’s visa status. It affects everyone in the

community. It is a real risk to public health of all people in Australia if hundreds

of thousands of people are forced into the streets with no work and no income.



The Government should also consider helping temporary visa holders to return

to their home country where it is possible to do so.



Labor secured amendments in the Parliament that allow Social Services

Minister Anne Ruston to extend the Special Benefits Payment to any visa

holders who need help during this crisis. Today’s announcement does not

include any extension of these payments to temporary visa holders.





Labor is committed to working constructively with the Government to do

everything we can to protect Australian lives during this crisis.
