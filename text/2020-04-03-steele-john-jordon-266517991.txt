NATIONAL ADVISORY GROUP A BIG WIN FOR DISABLED PEOPLE



Friday 3rd April, 2020



Australian Greens Disability spokesperson Senator Jordon Steele-John has

labelled Health Minister Greg Hunt's announcement of the establishment of a

National Advisory Group to guide development and implementation of a

response plan focusing on the unique health needs of disabled people a "huge

win" for the community.



"This is what the Greens, Australia's peak disability advocacy organisations and

the community have been calling for for weeks. This National advisory group

should have been started weeks ago but the reality is that now they'll be forced

to play catch up," Steele-John said.



"We don't have any more time to waste. Disabled people need a dedicated and

natinonally coordinated stategy now to ensure that they have the information

and support they need to get through the COVID-19 pandemic.



"So far the government has failed to actively include us from the response to

COVID-19 and this has caused significant anxiety and concern amongst our

community.



"Today, more than 70 of Australia's disability organisation and advocacy bodies



released a statement calling for ten urgent actions to be taken to address the

impacts of COVID-19 on disabled people, our families and our support

networks.



"I'm calling on the National Advisory Group tomeet urgently and consider these

ten action points to ensure that disabled people, our families and our support

networks can have the information and support we need to get through this

COVID-19 crisis."
