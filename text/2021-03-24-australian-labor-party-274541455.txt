MORRISON GOVERNMENT MISMANAGEMENT MEANS DEFENCE

CAPABILITIES MISSING IN ACTION WHILE COSTS BLOWOUT



New Defence budget papers have shown major declines in the availability of ships,

helicopters, and planes between the October 2020 budget estimates and the February 2021

update.



During this same period, the Defence Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements 2020-21

reveal sustainment costs blew out by $23 million.



Of major concern is the availability of our Joint Strike Fighters.



Our newest fighter aircraft should be our most reliable, however their 2020-21 flying hours

have been reduced by 36 per cent below what was planned four months ago.



Despite this, the cost of maintaining the aircraft remains at a quarter of a billion dollars per

year.



Our pilots are being dudded while taxpayers are being ripped off.





Other capabilities underperforming due to the Morrison Government’s chaos and

mismanagement include:



The Morrison Government cannot blame this latest woeful underperformance on the COVID-19 pandemic.



Our nation had been dealing with this crisis for nine months by the point the availability

estimates were listed in the October 2020 Defence Portfolio Budget Statement.



Therefore the impact of COVID-19 would have been fully accounted for when these availability

estimates were first developed.



Defence capabilities underperforming is nothing new under successive Coalition Governments,

and it’s clear the problem is not improving.



The current incompetent Defence Minister is presiding over a sustainment system that is at

best significantly underperforming, and at worst clearly failing in some areas.



The Morrison Government is in crisis and is incapable of managing our Defence capabilities.
