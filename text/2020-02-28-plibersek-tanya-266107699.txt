SPEECH TO THE UNIVERSITIES AUSTRALIA CONFERENCE

CANBERRA

THURSDAY, 27 FEBRUARY 2020

***CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY***

I want to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we meet, the Ngunnawal  people, and pay respect to their Elders past and present.

Thanks to Universities Australia for inviting me to give this address.

Thanks to Catriona Jackson, the Chief Executive of Universities Australia, for chairing this  morning.

Thanks to Professor Deborah Terry, the chair of Universities Australia.

And thanks to all the Vice Chancellors, academics, administrators and students who have  made their way to Canberra for this year’s conference.  I was looking through the program the other day - and you’ve put together an amazing line  up here.  It’s the Splendour in the Grass of Australian universities.  Or perhaps the Woodstock of Australian universities, depending on your vintage.

Unfortunately, Parliament is sitting this week - otherwise I would have loved to spend more  of the day listening to the fascinating speakers and panels coming after me.

The theme of this conference is ‘Education Changes Lives’.

This was certainly true for me, as I’m sure it was true for everybody in this room.

If you walk through an Australian campus on a sunny day, it’s hard not to be caught up in  the energy and optimism. It’s infectious.

There aren’t many other places like it; where people are given the tools and the space to  develop themselves as critical thinkers, as full human beings.



Universities are places where Australians can discover their passions; where they can  meet kindred spirits; where they can explore the world in its breadth and complexity.

This is true of the first-year student stepping out into adulthood, feeling their way to  independence. And it’s equally true of the mature age student, starting a new chapter in  life.

We shouldn’t shy away from this side of the university. It’s not something to be  embarrassed about or blush over.

I know that conservatives can be uncomfortable with this idea.

In the more paranoid corners of the conservative imagination, universities can be  suspicious places - at best, an indulgence; at worst, a place where people spend three  years reading Derrida before breakfast, plotting revolution in the afternoon, and planning  the downfall of western civilisation at night.

As everyone here knows, higher education is not an indulgence.

The university’s mission stretches back to 9th century Morocco.

The oldest university in Europe, the University of Bologna of 1088, goes by the Latin motto,  Alma Mater Studiorum: ‘the nourishing mother of the studies’.

Almost a thousand years on, universities are still there to nourish us; to develop human  capacity in all its forms.

But this mission goes beyond self-discovery or self-improvement; it goes to the heart of  this country’s economic future.

While the premium on graduate incomes has fallen slightly over the past decade, it’s still  real - and it’s still substantial.

As research from the Grattan Institute shows, on average, young men with a university  degree earn more than $12,500 a year more than younger men who completed high  school.

This is even more pronounced when you look at young female graduates, where the  premium sits at almost $14,000 a year.

For both men and women - but women in particular - this figure has implications that flow  right through their life: from home ownership, to health outcomes, to family planning.

Universities are good for these students - and they’re good for the societies that educate  them.

The evidence is clear.

Research by the Deloitte Access Economics placed the value of universities to Australia’s  productive capacity at $140 billion.



That is, Australia’s annual GDP is $140 billion a year higher because of improved  productivity due to the 28% of our workforce with university qualifications.

When we talk about the modern university, we’re talking about dozens of faculties and  disciplines - each offering its own unique set of skills and knowledge.

The modern university offers courses in commerce, science, engineering, information  technology, medicine and the humanities.

You train the scientists making new discoveries; you train the engineers turning them into  products; you train the marketers selling their vision to the world; and you train the  teachers helping the next generation do it all again.

This is why we need to fight for universities - and it’s why we need to fight like we mean it.

Not because universities are good for people in this room.

But because universities are central to the future of this country.

As advocates for the sector, we should be clear about just how foundational universities  are to Australia’s economic success.

We should be clear about the role they play in the country’s economic, social and  intellectual development.

And we should be clear about why funding them properly matters.

Between this event and last year’s Universities Australia conference, we’ve had a federal  election.

Now, I don’t want to dwell on the results for too long, but there was a lot on the line in May.

The two major parties went to the election with fundamentally different visions of higher  education in Australia - with different promises, different policies, and vastly different  resources.

Most significantly, Labor promised to reintroduce demand driven funding to universities,  which involved an extra $10 billion for the system over the next decade.

On top of that, Labor promised a $300 million University Future Fund, to guarantee funding  to areas of high priority research.

And Labor promised $174 million for student equity pathways - which would support  students from communities with low graduation rates, by giving them the extra mentorship  they need to succeed and flourish.

This was a vision of equity and excellence for our universities.

And it represented one of Labor’s largest spending commitments.

It would have made a real difference to how you all operate.

Elections have consequences. Sadly for us - and sadly for you too, I think - we weren’t  given the power to implement our vision.

There’s an important lesson here. I know it’s sensitive, so I won’t harp on it.

But you shouldn’t be afraid to campaign for your interests as universities.

You shouldn’t feel reluctant to make your views clear - and you shouldn’t feel reluctant to  express them with force.

I’m not asking you to be partisan or overly political. I understand the position you are in.

But you have enormous credibility with students and parents and with business - and you  should use it.

As I said, we all need to fight for our universities.

One of the reasons we need to fight is that we have a skills crisis in this country - and we  can’t solve it without a world class higher education system.

Australia’s skills crisis has two sides to it.

On one hand, we now have almost two million Australians who are either looking for work,  or looking for more hours.

That’s millions of Australians living with the reality of unemployment or underemployment -  on top of the millions who haven’t had a decent pay rise in years, and the thousands who  have suffered wage theft.

At the same time, an Australian Industry Group survey found that 75 per cent of  businesses were struggling to find the qualified workers they need.

These two trends shouldn’t go together - but under this Government they do.

Part of the university’s role here is what you’ve always done: educating the next generation  in the broad skills needed to thrive in a changing world.   Building resilient people, with resilient minds.

This will never lose its value.

But universities need to also work with government, industry and the TAFE systems to skill  our workforce, particularly in areas of shortage.

That means tackling geographic shortages, for instance, by offering training courses at  regional university campuses to fill holes in the rural health workforce; or training people to  fill sector specific shortages.

We don’t need to force students to choose these industries.  If we have strong information  sharing, people will be able to make good decisions for themselves.



There’s a myth that needs busting here: that higher education and vocational education  are somehow in competition; or that a hierarchy should exist between the two sectors.

It’s obvious we need both.

Everybody in this room knows this. We should make it clear to people who want to position  these sectors against each other that none of us accept an ‘either/or’ view of Australian  education.

People are different, and our society and economy need a diversity of skills to function.

Australians will increasingly need or want access to both vocational and university  education across their working life.

This is why collaboration is so important - both across education sectors, and also  between education and industry.

We’ve already seen some wonderful examples of this.

On Monday I met the ACT apprentice of the year - James White - who started engineering  at university before moving into a carpentry apprenticeship.  Despite his change in  direction, he benefitted from his time at university.

Just last week, I read about a partnership between Telstra and the Royal Melbourne  Institute of Technology.

The two organisations have co-designed a new micro-credentialing course, Software  Defined Networking.

The program helps Telstra workers transition from physical to virtual networks, as the  industry around them evolves.

They developed the course to complement existing skills - assisting workers across stages  in their lifelong learning journey.

While micro-credentials need to build on a strong principal qualification, programs like this  can - when designed properly - help people navigate economic change.

This is just one example, but it shows what’s possible when educators and industry work  together.

University research is another area in desperate need of assistance and collaboration.

Australian universities are doing terrific, cutting edge work, but you’re being dragged down  by this Government’s ongoing neglect.

As Universities Australia forecast, government investment in research and development is  set to reach its lowest level as a share of GDP in four decades.

That’s lower than it was in 1978.



Universities Australia described the Government’s cuts as ‘ram raid on Australia’s future  economic growth, prosperity, wealth and development’.

I couldn’t have said it better.

Few things symbolise this government’s failure of foresight and planning - its basic lack of  interest in the future - more than its treatment of university research.

And this is even before we factor in the Minister’s repeated interventions in decisions made  by the Australian Research Council - decisions that elevated government ideology over  academic merit.

University research should be independent of the whims and prejudices of the Education  Minister - and it should be funded like the national priority it is.

It should be the Government’s job to provide certainty to the sector.

As you’ve all experienced this semester with the coronavirus, the health of our universities  is subject to enough external shocks, without governments adding more.

On that note: I want to commend everyone on the flexibility with which you’ve responded to  the virus. You’ve balanced your own needs, the needs of your students, and the needs of  public health with great maturity.

The internationalisation of Australian education is a great success story; one that has  enriched our society as well as our campuses.

I’ve seen the power of this abroad, as well as at home.

I’ve met dozens of senior leaders in our region who continue to speak fondly of their time  studying in Australia and of the lifelong connections they made.

International education is an important export industry - one of Australia’s largest, that  supports many Australian jobs.

But the current disruption is a reminder of the risk involved in our current economic model,  which relies on a handful of countries for the bulk of international students.

As I said at last year’s conference, Australian universities need a plan for market  diversification, and it should be a priority for the sector.

Universities need financial certainty as much as they need policy certainty - and there  hasn’t been much of either in recent years.

We’ve now had more than 28 reviews into higher education under this government, with a  cost of over $5 million, but the policy uncertainty and financial risks are still there.

For three terms now, this process has offered an excuse for the government’s neglect of  universities.



Of all people, you would know: procrastination is rarely the path to success.

You saw the policies we took to the last election. And you saw our actions when we were  in Government.

The last Labor Government opened up universities, giving an additional 190,000 people a  higher education.

We boosted investment from $8 billion in 2007, to $14 billion in 2013.

Under these policies, we saw a new diversity in our universities.

Indigenous enrolments went up, more Australians with disability got degrees, as did people  from regional and remote areas.

These are the kinds of aspirations that should be driving any government’s education  policy - and they’re the aspirations that will continue to define Labor’s policies at the next  election.

While Labor is still in the process of policy development, our guiding principles are clear.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Boosting university attainment to address skills shortages and meet future  workforce needs.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Making sure all Australians who get the grades have the opportunity to study at  university - particularly those in outer-suburban and regional areas currently  missing out; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The importance of stimulating collaboration between universities and industry, with  a focus on local business and jobs.

I look forward to working with you in the years ahead.

More than anyone, you know the value of universities to our country - and we need your  experience and ideas as we plan for the future.

Thanks for having me.
