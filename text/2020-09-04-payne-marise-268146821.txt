MEDIA RELEASE  AMBASSADOR TO MOROCCO

Today I announce the appointment of Mr Michael Cutts as Australia’s new Ambassador  to Morocco.

Australia and Morocco share a long-standing relationship. The establishment of an  Australian Embassy in Rabat in June 2017 has presented new opportunities to further  our engagement and support our relations.

Australia acknowledges the efforts of Morocco in combating the spread of COVID-19,  and appreciates the support provided to Australians to make their way home during the  pandemic.

Australia values Morocco’s significant contribution to international efforts to fight global  terrorism and violent extremism, and we work together as members of the Global  Coalition to Defeat ISIS.

We recognise Morocco is an important North African economy. We look forward to  expanding our trade and investment links, including in food and agriculture,  infrastructure, and sustainable development.

Mr Cutts is a career officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and was  most recently Director, Goods and Government Procurement Section in the Office of  Trade Negotiations. He has previously served overseas at UNESCO, and in Paris and  Madrid.

Mr Cutts holds a Master of Arts in Foreign Affairs and Trade; a Bachelor of Arts and a  Graduate Diploma in Education from Monash University; and a Graduate Diploma in  Interpreting/Translation from Deakin University.
