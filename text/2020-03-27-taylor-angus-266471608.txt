ENERGY RETAILERS AND NETWORKS MUST PROTECT AUSTRALIAN HOUSEHOLDS  AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE GONE INTO HIBERNATION

The Australian Government has set reasonable expectations of energy companies to protect  householders and small business customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, outlined today by  the Australian Energy Regulator (AER).

The AER’s Statement of Expectations sets out a range measures, including:   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Waiving any disconnection, re-connection and/or contract break fees for  small businesses which have gone into hibernation, along with daily  supply charges to retailers, during any period of disconnection until at

least 31 July 2020;    Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Offering all households and small businesses who indicate they may be in  financial stress a payment plan or hardship arrangement;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Not disconnecting customers who may be in financial stress, without

their agreement before 31 July 2020 and potentially beyond;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Deferring referral of any customer to a debt collection agency for  recovery actions, or credit default listing until at least 31 July 2020 and

potentially beyond; and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Minimising the frequency and duration of planned outages for critical  works, and providing as much notice as possible to assist households and

businesses to manage during any outage.



Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said  the Australian Government will be closely monitoring retailer and network compliance with  these measures.



“The electricity and gas sector, as an essential service, has an obligation to support customers  through these difficult times,” Treasurer Frydenberg said.

“The Government is focussed on working to slow the spread of the virus, while putting in place  actions to limit the impact of COVID-19 on people’s lives, jobs and businesses - and industry  must play their role.”

Minister Taylor said it was imperative for energy companies to help customers who are  experiencing difficulty.

“It is vitally important that we all pull together to help those who are being impacted by  COVID19,” Minister Taylor said.

“While several energy companies have taken some steps to assist their customers in financial  stress, during these difficult times we expect more action.”

“We expect energy companies to look after their customers, keep them connected and waive  additional fees and charges for those doing it tough.

“We expect them to do more to help small businesses who have gone into hibernation to avoid  any energy costs, and we expect them to pass on the huge price drops we are seeing in the  wholesale market.”

The Government believes it is important customers who can pay their bills continue to do  so,  while the energy companies do more to help those in need, beyond the business-as usual  hardship arrangements.

The Government welcomes the AER’s announcement that it is also amending its performance  reporting framework to allow more timely access to data on payment plans, hardship,  disconnections and credit collection.

This enhanced reporting will allow the AER and the Government to quickly identify where  energy customers are experiencing difficulty and to act accordingly.

These are extremely challenging times. It is essential that the energy sector works with  government to provide the support that the Australian people need.

AER Statement of Expectations of energy  businesses: Protecting consumers and the  energy market during COVID-19





The COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on the Australian community and our stakeholders.

Many people are or will be affected by dramatic changes to their lives, businesses, income and working  arrangements, and those of their friends, families and communities. Energy use and the ability to pay their  bills may in turn be affected.

We expect that those customers who can pay their bills will go on doing so. This is vital to ensuring the  ongoing viability of energy businesses. However, we also recognise that the circumstances arising from this  pandemic, and the impacts on the economy, mean more customers may find it difficult, or impossible, to  pay their bills at the moment. Customers should be encouraged to utilise online assistance on retailer  websites or contact call centres as early as possible. Retailers must also be mindful of the different  communication needs of their customers, including those from culturally and linguistically diverse  backgrounds.

Energy is an essential service. The energy market has an important role to play in protecting and  supporting businesses and the community through the pandemic and our recovery. There are important  steps we expect energy businesses to action from today to support their customers.

Our expectations

To ensure the continued safe and reliable supply of energy to homes and businesses, and to support both  residential and small business customers experiencing financial stress, we expect retailers, distributors and  exempt sellers to adhere to the following principles to the maximum extent possible.

These principles are intended to ensure the protection of customers and the market through this difficult  time.

1. Offer all residential and small business customers who indicate they may be in financial stress a  payment plan or hardship arrangement, regardless of whether the customer meets the ‘usual’  criteria for that assistance.

2. Do not disconnect any residential or small business customers who may be in financial stress,  without their agreement, before 31 July 2020 and potentially beyond.

3. Do not disconnect any large business customer, without their agreement, before 31 July 2020, and  potentially beyond, if that customer is on-selling energy to residential or small business customers  (for example, in residential parks or retirement villages).

4. Defer referrals of customers to debt collection agencies for recovery actions, or credit default listing  until at least 31 July 2020.

5. Be prepared to modify existing payment plans if a customer’s changed circumstances make this  necessary.

6. Waive disconnection, reconnection and/or contract break fees for small businesses that have  ceased operation, along with daily supply charges to retailers, during any period of disconnection  until at least 31 July 2020.

7. Prioritise the safety of customers who require life support equipment and continue to meet  responsibilities to new life support customers.

8. Prioritise clear, up-to-date communications with customers about the issues addressed in this  Statement, including by keeping website, social media and call centre waiting and hold messages  up to date, so customers can readily access updates when they need them and relieve some  pressure on affected call centres.

9. Prioritise clear communications with customers about the availability of retailer and other supports,  including the availability of payment plans, energy efficiency advice and fault repair.

10. Minimise the frequency and duration of planned outages for critical works, and provide as much  notice as possible to assist households and businesses to manage during any outage.

Some of these principles reflect particular responses required in the current COVID-19 pandemic, while  others reinforce existing requirements under energy laws.

Compliance

Our compliance focus is ensuring customers receive the support they need and protections to which they  are entitled. We will be closely monitoring compliance with provisions of the National Energy Retail Law,  National Energy Retail Rules and exemption guidelines that protect customers facing payment difficulties.

We will also be closely monitoring customer outcomes, and the extent to which our expectations as set out  in this Statement are met, through our performance reporting framework and our ongoing engagement with  energy Ombudsman schemes.

Our performance reporting framework will be amended to enable more timely reporting of data on payment  plans, hardship, disconnection and credit collection. Outcomes of our monitoring will inform whether any  changes are needed to existing guidelines or rules to better protect customers. This includes rules and  guidelines on minimum disconnection levels, customer hardship, and compliance procedures.

Contact us at an early stage if current conditions create compliance difficulties. We will work with all market  participants to address concerns and will, where appropriate, consider a more flexible approach to ensure  market participants can continue to operate in the long-term interests of end users.

Our priorities

We recognise there is a need to focus on new and emerging issues of critical importance to the energy  industry and to residential and small business customers who are facing a range of difficulties. For the  foreseeable future, we will therefore be prioritising:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Ensuring retailers proactively meet the needs of customers - both residential and SMEs - in  vulnerable circumstances, particularly where this can minimise debt and hardship, and ensure that all  households and small businesses can access the energy they need.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Protecting consumers who may be unable to safeguard their own interests, including customers  requiring life support equipment or who are experiencing financial difficulty.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Actions needed to ensure the safety and reliability of energy supply.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Being responsive to the rapidly evolving pandemic situation, and preparing for our recovery, including  engagement with market participants on specific concerns and new and emerging issues.

We have been working, along with other market bodies, to review the timing of current and upcoming  regulatory initiatives and approaches we all have underway and how these might need to change so energy  businesses can focus on their business and support their customers. Among other things, this includes  delaying our review of the Retail Pricing Information Guidelines.

We recognise that our expectations in this Statement may add to the risks and costs facing energy  businesses. We are particularly concerned about the continued viability of energy businesses and we are  proactively working with all stakeholders on options to appropriately balance these risks and costs across  the sector and to ensure energy businesses get the assistance they may need in the coming months.
