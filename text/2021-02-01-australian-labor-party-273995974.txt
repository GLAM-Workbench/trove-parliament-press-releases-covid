TELEVISION INTERVIEW

TODAY SHOW

MONDAY, 1 FEBRUARY 2021



SUBJECTS: WA lockdown; Queensland border reopening; Resumption of Parliament;

Election; JobKeeper; Report on racism at AFL club; Book on raising Australian girls.



ALLISON LANGDON, HOST: I'm joined by Shadow Minister for Education and Women,

Tanya Plibersek, and the Daily Telegraph's political editor Anna Caldwell. Nice to see both of

you. Tanya. I mean ten months, no community transmission in WA, a hard lockdown, is it

necessary?



TANYA PLIBERSEK, SHADOW MINISTER FOR EDUCATION AND WOMEN: Look, it's so

hard on the people of WA and we are really thinking of them. But I know that Mark McGowan

is a brave and determined leader, and he'll take the health advice to do what's right for WA.



LANGDON: Anna, the concern here is of course how many places that this guard visited while

unknowingly infectious?



ANNA CALDWELL: Yeah, that's right. So he's been to 16 places. It's a lot. I do think, you

know, these measures will stun some people, you know, a five-day locked down from one

case. I don't think any of us ever really expected to get to that point. But this case does seem

to be unique, you know, 16 locations, an Uber driver, who knows how many people he's come

into contact with. But I really do feel for those businesses who need to shut for five days, you

know mums and dads who have to stay home to look after their kids because they can't go to

work. It's a tough time.



LANGDON: This is the tricky thing isn't it with hotel quarantine? We need to bring these

Aussies who are stranded overseas home, but this is the risk that we face. Tanya, Mark

McGowan, I mean, he was very quick at the start of this to shut off the rest of Australia. I mean

a lot of us in the east didn't like it, but it was very popular at home. He does have an election

coming up soon. Do you think that this is going to impact that? Will it hurt him in any way, what

he's doing?



PLIBERSEK: No, I think in fact people are grateful to Mark McGowan because he kept West

Australians safe for all those months. And yes, it's taken its toll. But people in the west, my

colleagues from the west, tell me it's like normal life. Until this most recent lockdown, they've

been going out, they've been going to restaurants, they've been going to cafes, they've been

going to work, their kids have been going to school, because Mark McGowan kept them safe.

So I think there's probably a lot of positive feeling towards him, even with this five-day

lockdown which will take its toll, of course it will.



LANGDON: And I did notice of course yesterday the grocery stores stripped bare.



PLIBERSEK: Yeah. It's extraordinary, isn't it? Even a few weeks ago when Sydney had a

couple of cases - the northern beaches thing happened. I went to my local supermarket, no

toilet paper. It's like people relax, you know, we have actually got this. The one thing we've got

really good at is restocking the shelves - the people who work in the supermarkets, the truck

drivers around the country, we've got it. You don't need to hoard.



LANDGON: I've just never understood why that it's the dunny paper that’s the first thing we go

for. But all of this Anna, as Queensland reopens to everyone in greater Sydney - that's going

to be great for tourism operators up there.



CALDWELL: That's right. And thank goodness for that. I mean the time has come. My concern

is, as you know, that we go back to this stop-start approach with borders. I don't think we can

afford that. I think state Premiers need to be doing all they can to try and keep borders open in

a safe way. So a better balance I think is what's needed. Thank goodness the Queensland

border is open again, and hopefully it can continue.



LANDGON: I tell you what too. A big week in Canberra as Parliament returns. The PM using a

speech to warn that Covid support payments have to end, while committing almost $2 billion to

ramp up the nation's Covid vaccination program. I mean Tanya, is it time to wean ourselves off

Covid subsidies like JobKeeper?



PLIBERSEK: We've still got 1.6 million Australians who are relying on JobKeeper. And there's

some parts of the economy that are really struggling. Like if you work anywhere where

international tourism is a feature, like a hotel that welcomes international guests, you are still

really struggling. The real problem is that the Morrison Government's given a bunch of money

to companies that have ended up doing extraordinarily well, having record profits. They've got

JobKeeper. Instead of giving it to companies that have done well during the pandemic,

perhaps we should have given it for a bit longer to the people and the parts of the economy

that are still struggling. We've got more than two million Australians who are unemployed or

need more hours of work. We've got to be looking after these people and supporting them for

the long term.



LANGDON: So too soon in your mind. Anna do you think we’re shaping up for an early

election?



CALDWELL: Well, I did think that. I can see Newspoll is out is today, which is a tighter result,

which kind of does call that into question. You know, these decisions around JobKeeper are

significant for Scott Morrison because his view is, he doesn't want the Budget to be a blank

cheque. He doesn't want to be paying welfare forever. Tanya Plibersek is right, you know,

there is concern is about businesses that just still can't keep their head above water. We can't

let them just kind of die off as a nation. But I do think it's time for Premiers to potentially step

up, particularly with those tourism businesses.



LANGDON: Will Tanya Plibersek be the Opposition Leader going into the next election?



PLIBERSEK: No, no - I'm very much looking forward to serving in an Albanese Labor

Government.



LANGDON: Come on, when are you rolling him?



PLIBERSEK: No, I'm doing my job, which is the Shadow Minister for Education - and I'm

doing it the best I can so that I can be part of an Albanese Labor Government.



LANGDON: Just being cheeky. Hey now there is an important story in today's Herald Sun I

want to talk about - the paper obtaining a leaked report uncovering systemic racism at

Collingwood footy club, claiming years of abuse was swept under the carpet. I mean the club

commissioned this report. Anna, it is scathing. They now need to act don't they?



CALDWELL: They absolutely need to act and, you know, thank goodness to see this

information presented. I would rather see it presented in a report than swept under the carpet

for nobody to know about. And you know, I think it's a wake-up call for all sorts of businesses,

all sorts of clubs that, you know, they need to consider these issues. It's horrifying and

something needs to be done.



LANGDON: Yeah, and as we've seen examples of this over the past years, that have been

truly horrific. So well done on the club though commissioning his report. But just quickly

because I do want to finish on this. I want to talk about a new book claiming to rewrite the rules

on raising Aussie girls, saying that we as adults, we need to stop complimenting young girls on

their looks, their clothes or their bodies and instead focus on their achievements. It also says

no one should be allowed to kiss girls without permission, even close relatives like grandma. I

loved the first part of this; the second part of it raised a few issues for me. Tanya, what are

your thoughts?



PLIBERSEK: Well, I can tell you my mum would not would not abide by that rule. There's a lot

of hugging, there's a lot of cheek squeezing. But seriously, we should compliment kids on the

qualities that we want them to display - kindness, hard work, honesty, decency, intelligence. All

of those things are really important. But I can't help telling my kids, and frankly other kids too,

that they're cute, that they're lovely. I think just getting a balance is the right thing to do - and

that's for boys and girls, you know. We want to compliment them on the qualities that we want

to see them grow up with.



LANGDON: I'm mean I compliment both of my kids, a boy and a girl, and call them beautiful all

the time. I think sometimes when I'm saying beautiful, I'm not just talking about their physical

looks, I talk about what's inside-



PLIBERSEK: Their hearts and their minds, they are really important.



LANGDON: No kisses from grandma, Anna?



CALDWELL: I don't know about that one either, absolutely. I mean but also strength. Strength

is another great compliment to give kids. You know, you're so strong. You're so funny. There's

so many ways to go. But we can't become to PC when it comes to complimenting kids I don't

think.



LANGDON: Nice to have you both in here.



PLIBERSEK: Thank you.



LANGDON: Enjoy Canberra this week.



PLIBERSEK: Yes, will do.



LANGDON: You won't all be there. You've got a couple in lockdown, who've flown over from

WA.



PLIBERSEK: I feel so sorry. Imagine getting off the plane and being told you're in lockdown for

a few days. Hard work.



LANGDON: Thank you.
