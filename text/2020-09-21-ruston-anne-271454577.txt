MINISTER RUSTON:

I want to assure all Australians that their Government is committed to providing ongoing  temporary levels of support to support them through the coronavirus pandemic and on the  other side. As we announced in the July Economic Fiscal Update, we would be continuing  both the JobSeeker and the JobKeeper payments at elevated levels past the end of this  week. As of Monday, the JobKeeper payments will be in two tranches, one for people who  work for more than 20 hours a week will receive $1200 a fortnight and those that work for  less than 20 hours a week will get $750 per fortnight. But you do not need to be unemployed  to access JobSeeker payment as well. So for somebody for instance who's on the full rate of  JobKeeper of $1200 a fortnight who finds themselves in a situation where that is their only  income, because their employer is not able to top up their payment, they are likely, if they're  a single person without children, to be eligible for $276 of JobSeeker payment per fortnight  as well. But that also means that the additional supplements and allowances that you get on  a JobSeeker or an income support payment will also be available to them whereby for  instance they may be eligible for rent assistance, a healthcare card, et cetera. And if they are  people with children they will also be able to get the maximum rate of Family Tax Benefit.  In  addition, and in the case of somebody who's on $750 a fortnight, on the lower rate of  JobKeeper payment, they would be likely to access around $546 a fortnight as well as  getting the other supplements too. As of Friday the JobSeeker payments will be extended for  a further period of three months to 31 December. The supplement will be paid on an ongoing  basis at $250 per fortnight but in addition we'll be introducing an income free area of $300  which basically says to people who find themselves in a position where they can get some  work that we will allow them to earn the first $300 before they lose any of their payment.  What we seek to do by this is to create a balance between people with elevated levels of  support, recognising that our job market is very shallow at the moment but also to provide  the right incentives for them to re-engage with the jobs market. So we will continue to  monitor over the coming weeks and months the economic conditions that exist particularly in  the job market and we'll be making further announcements about any further temporary  measures when that information is available to us. So thank you.



JOURNALIST:

Given you're increasing the age pension as well in the Budget, plus these measures, is there  any idea of how much impact it will have on the bottom line?

MINISTER RUSTON:

Well look clearly matters for the Budget are not something I'm going to speculate on here  today. But certainly, the Budget will be very focused on getting the economy opened up and  getting people back to work.

JOURNALIST:

Is the Government doing enough to support the aged care sector?

MINISTER RUSTON:

Well I mean the Government has made significant investments in the aged care sector,  particularly in relation to supporting the sector deal with the COVID pandemic. But clearly  we've also got a Royal Commission which will bring back to us a whole heap of  recommendations which we will act on but we will continue to make ongoing improvements  for the sector while we're waiting for the Royal Commission to report.

JOURNALIST:

What happens to the coronavirus supplement after the three months?

MINISTER RUSTON:

Well as I said we will continue to monitor the economic conditions and most particularly the  state of the jobs market going forward and we'll make some decisions about what we might  do post 31 December closer to that date. But I want to assure all Australians if elevated  supports are continued to be needed they will be made available.

JOURNALIST:

So it's in the Budget?

MINISTER RUSTON:

No, later in the year. I mean the decisions that we've made, the changes that we make at the  end of this week haven't even come into force yet. So we need to wait to see what happens  with those and also to see how the economic conditions improve. Hopefully, as we move  further forward this year, hopefully, we'll see Victoria come out of lockdown and restrictions  sooner. So we'd like to wait a little bit longer so we've got better economic statistics and  information before we make any further changes.

JOURNALIST:

You spoke before about importance of incentivising work. We're hearing that cherry farmers  are struggling to find workers to pick [indistinct]… Is there a need for JobSeeker to come  down so it doesn't discourage people from seeking work?

MINISTER RUSTON:

Well, we're concerned about the concerns of the cherry growers and a number of other  industry sectors have said that they're having difficulty in actually finding employees. That's  why part of the measures that will be coming in on Friday is the reintroduction of mutual  obligations, for people outside of Victoria, to seek for them to start engaging with the jobs  market again. Because we believe that no Australian who is unemployed should be turning  down a job if they are able to do it. And also on Friday, as part of the changes to JobSeeker  going forward, we've put that income-free area of $300 in place, which hopefully will further  incentivise people who are unemployed to take up the jobs that are available when they  come available.

JOURNALIST:

Is applying for eight jobs though too many when there's not really that many jobs out there?

MINISTER RUSTON:

Well, what we've sought to do is to- it's a maximum of eight jobs. And in economies and  marketplaces where there is good employment, we would be seeking people to undertake  the search for eight jobs. But we understand that there are other parts of our economy that  don't have high levels of employment available and so the job service providers will be  allowed to make decisions in relation to the number of job searches somebody has to do that  reflect the market conditions in their area.

JOURNALIST:

How does the Government intend to promote skills and support apprentices when there  aren't even enough jobs to go around for existing tradies?

MINISTER RUSTON:

Well, clearly one of the things we will be seeking to do going forward, part of our plan to get  out of the COVID crisis, is to make sure that we build the economy back up again. We've  done it before, we'll do it again so that we can make sure that these jobs are provided but we  are particularly concerned about young Australians. They were certainly, along with women,  some of the hardest hit when the pandemic first came in and jobs were lost. I mean  pleasantly we've seen quite a number of those jobs have been the first ones to return but it  is young Australians that we're very focused on and that's why we want to focus on reskilling  and particularly apprentices. But to do that, we have to make sure that our economy is  opened up and we get on with the job of building the economy again.

JOURNALIST:

How is the Government effectively going to dismount from these wage subsidy programs like  JobSeeker and JobKeeper?

MINISTER RUSTON:

Clearly we had to put in place very, very broad measures when we found out the pandemic  was going to hit back in March. And so we put a blanket over the economy to provide the  supports for all Australians to get through. On Friday and Monday, this is our first stage of a

step down to try to move away from just blanket levels of support to provide additional  incentives into the market place, to try and recreate a good balance between the levels of  support that people clearly need in this absolutely once in a century pandemic, but also we  need to incentivise people to get back into the market. We need to support businesses to get  on with the job of doing what they do because they're the ones that create the jobs for  Australians.

JOURNALIST:

How would tax cuts to high and middle income earners, how would those tax cuts actually  help people to spend more, when experts say those people earning higher levels of money  are more likely to save? How's that going to generate more in the economy?

MINISTER RUSTON:

I'm certainly not going to speculate about what's in the Budget. But what I would say is that  the Government is very focused on a broad suite of measures to improve aggregate demand  because it's through aggregate demand that we'll be able to stimulate the economy.

JOURNALIST:

Tens of thousands of Australians are stranded overseas due to COVID. They've registered  their desire to come home through DFAT. Labor says the increased cap on Australian  arrivals isn't enough and more needs to be done. What do you say to that?

MINISTER RUSTON:

Well clearly we were very pleased on Friday that the states and territories at National  Cabinet made the decision that they were all going to increase their caps. We saw New  South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia all agree to increase their  caps. Clearly the Government will continue to work with all states and territories so that we  can lift the caps such that all Australians who are overseas will have the opportunity to come  home but in addition to that through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, we have  made available no-interest loans to people to support them with their living costs while  they're overseas but for those that we are able to get home, to assist them with their  repatriation costs. Thanks.
