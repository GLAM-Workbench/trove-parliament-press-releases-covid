NEW NORTHERN AUSTRALIA REPORT CALLS FOR CHANGE



The Federal Government must do more to prioritise local jobs, fast-track funding and invest in

small projects to help regional areas in Northern Australia recover post-COVID, a new Senate

inquiry report has found.



The interim report, handed down today by the Senate Select Committee on the Effectiveness

of the Australian Government’s Northern Australia agenda, outlined a series of

recommendations to fast-track growth in the region.



Following more than a year of face-to-face hearings in Darwin, Townsville, Mt Isa, Mackay and

Nhulunbuy, along with a series of video-conferences, the bipartisan inquiry called for more

focused Federal Government investment on smaller shovel-ready projects, First Nations-led

projects and industries that have been badly hit by COVID-19.



Of the nine unanimous recommendations made, eight related to changes to the struggling

Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF), a $5 billion federal loans scheme.



The report found the NAIF was sluggish in delivering on funding, noting that “As of 30 October

2020, total payments of only $218.4 million (including capitalised interest) have been drawn

down. Further the NAIF’s current projections are that proponents will have made a drawdown

of only $400 million in NAIF funds by 30 June 2021. Simply put, the committee is concerned,

that it is taking too long for NAIF funding to get out the door.”



Among the recommendations, the report suggests:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Broadening the eligibility of the NAIF to allow smaller projects and more industries to

apply

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Consideration of converting some of the NAIF funds to grants, equity stakes and

guarantees to ensure small scale projects and First Nations projects are adequately

supported

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ensuring NAIF projects buy local and employ locals, as a way of generating jobs in the

regions

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A review by the Morrison Government to determine which industries have been hurt by

COVID-19 and prioritise projects within those industries

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Greater transparency and accountability when it comes to NAIF management, project

approval and staff bonuses



The message could not be clearer for the Morrison Government - the NAIF needs to be

overhauled significantly.



Less than five cents in every dollar of NAIF funding has been released since the program was

announced.



“The Office of Northern Australia and NAIF will be of critical importance in generating

economic development to ensure Northern Australia has a strong role in Australia’s post

COVID-19 economic recovery,” the interim report said.



The committee will continue to hold more public hearings in Northern Australia, including two in

Cairns and Thursday Island later this month.



A final report will be tabled in March 2021.
