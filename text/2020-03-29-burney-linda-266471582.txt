EMERGENCY RELIEF BOOST WELCOME BUT PAYMENTS STILL

NEEDED SOONER



The boost in emergency relief funding for food banks and financial counselling

services announced today is important and welcome step, which Labor has

been calling for.



But many families facing the loss of a job or being stood down will still be

waiting at least a month to get the $550 per fortnight Coronavirus supplement.



It is important that the Government does everything possible to reduce and

avoid the need for people to seek emergency relief in the first place.



Labor is calling on the government to bring forward the Coronavirus

Supplement which currently commences on 27 April and the Second Economic

Support Payment, which will not be available until 10 July.





People who have lost their job or been stood down need help and support now

- not months in the future.



The Government also needs to urgently address the crisis confronting not-for-profit and charity organisations more broadly - which represents an estimated

$129 billion of the Australian economy.



Australiaâ€™s charities and not-for-profits - which employ 800,000 people directly

and another 500,000 indirectly - have been hit by a double whammy of falling

donations and increasing demand for their services.



For many isolated Australians, community organisations are their only link to

services and community.



Australians are facing loneliness, joblessness and financial stress. Charities

and non-profits need to be supported so they can help meet these challenges.
