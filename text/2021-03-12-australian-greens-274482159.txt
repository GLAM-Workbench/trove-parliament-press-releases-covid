FRYDENBERG’S ANTI-MELBOURNE QANTASKEEPER SCHEME TAKES CORPORATE WELFARE OVER THE $100 BILLION MARK THIS YEAR

12 March 2021

Greens Leader and Member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, has lashed out at Treasurer Josh Frydenberg for his so-called tourism support package, describing it as an anti-Melbourne corporate welfare scheme that will do nothing to support a city still suffering from the COVID recession.

“Josh Frydenberg is giving public money to big corporations at Melbourne’s expense,” Bandt said.

“This big corporate handout is anti-Melbourne.



“Josh Frydenberg is paying Qantas to fly people away from Melbourne.

“Many people in Melbourne are dependent on businesses that are still struggling. Events, hospitality and tourism are important to our city, but there’s nothing in this package to support Melbourne’s hard-hit workers and businesses. There are 130,000 tourism workers here in Melbourne alone and 260,000 in the state. Most will be cut off JobKeeker and will get nothing out of this package.

“There is also nothing in this package to help our local arts and entertainment industry which has been hammered by lockdowns and brings tourists to our city.



“The Treasurer says he can’t afford to lift JobSeeker above the poverty line, but he can find billions in handouts for big corporations like Qantas. This cash for Qantas takes the total corporate welfare spend this financial year over the $100 billion dollar mark.

“The pandemic has seen a tale of two recoveries, with billionaires and big corporations doing extremely well, while wages stagnate and essentials like housing, health and education costs soar. Josh Frydenberg’s commitment to more corporate welfare, tax cuts for the rich and austerity for the rest of us is fanning the flames of inequality,” Bandt said.
