TOURISM SUPPORT FROM THE NT WELCOME - MORRISON MUST DO  MORE

The Northern Territory Government’s announcement of support for the tourism sector will  be a huge boost to the industry hit hard by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Territory Government have announced they will provide a discount of $200 for every  $1000 spent on an NT booking made through partnering travel retailers (up to a maximum  $1000 discount), with the discount to be valid for bookable flights, accommodation, tours  and attractions or vehicle hire.

This is a positive, proactive policy that will help drive demand and encourage Australians  who are keen to travel to head north and experience everything the Territory has to offer.

A number of states have now announced similar, intrastate travel discount schemes to  their residents to support their local tourism sectors by exploring their own states.

States and Territories are leading the way and making up for a lack of action from the  Morrison Government.

Simon Birmingham stood up at the National Press Club in June and told Australians it was  their “patriotic duty” to support the tourism industry by holidaying at home.

But it was just one more example of a government that’s all photo op and no follow up and  has left States and Territories to do the heavy lifting on supporting Australia’s vital tourism  industry.
