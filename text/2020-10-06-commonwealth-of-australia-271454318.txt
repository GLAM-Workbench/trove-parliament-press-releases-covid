Lower Taxes  Supporting households, driving  investment and creating jobs.

The Government is lowering taxes by over $50 billion  over the forward estimates, including around $9 billion  in 2020-21 and an additional $32 billion in 2021-22.

Reducing the personal income tax burden and  supporting business investment, through the  temporary full expensing and loss carry-back  measures, are estimated to boost GDP by

around $6 billion in 2020-21 and $19 billion  in 2021-22 and create around 100,000 jobs by  the end of 2021-22.

Lower personal income taxes In this Budget, the Government is delivering  an additional $17.8 billion in personal income  tax relief to support the economic recovery,  including an additional $12.5 billion over the  next 12 months.

It builds on the $8.1 billion in tax relief that is  being delivered for the 2020-21 income year  under our already legislated Personal Income  Tax Plan.

Under the Government’s changes, individuals  will benefit from bringing forward the tax  cuts in Stage 2 of our Plan, as well as a one-off  additional benefit from the low and middle  income tax offset in 2020-21.

In 2020-21, low- and middle-income earners  will receive tax relief of up to $2,745 for  singles, and up to $5,490 for dual income  families, compared with 2017-18 settings.

Around 11.6 million individuals will receive a tax  cut in 2020-21, compared with 2017-18 settings.

The majority of the benefit for 2020-21 will go to  those on incomes below $90,000.

Treasury estimates that reducing the personal  income tax burden on hard-working Australians  through this measure will boost GDP by around  $3.5 billion in 2020-21 and $9 billion in 2021-22  and will create an additional 50,000 jobs by  the end of 2021-22.

By putting more money in their pockets,  families will keep more of what they earn,  allowing them to spend more on what they  need. This keeps businesses operating and  ensures employers can retain their staff. As  sales increase, this will improve business  confidence and encourage them to create more  jobs and invest. This grows our economy now  and in the future.

The Personal Income Tax Plan The Government’s Plan is delivering lower  taxes and a simpler tax system that benefits  all Australians. Our Plan rewards effort and

contributes to a stronger economy.

The Plan is implemented in three stages and  makes taxes lower, fairer, and simpler.

Stage 1 delivered targeted tax relief to low- and  middle-income earners first. Over 9 million  Australians have been receiving tax relief for the  last two years from the low and middle income

tax offset.

Stage 2 will help protect the incomes of   hard-working Australians from bracket creep.  It means individuals are not unfairly penalised  for their effort by facing higher marginal  tax rates.

Stage 3 simplifies and flattens the personal  income tax system. This ensures Australians pay  less tax over their working lives. In 2024-25, it is  estimated that around 95 per cent of taxpayers

will face a marginal tax rate of 30 per cent  or less.

Delivering lower taxes The Government legislated its Plan in 2018 and  enhanced it in 2019. Now, for the third year in  a row, the Government is lowering taxes for

individuals by accelerating its Plan.

Lower taxes will play a key role in the economic  recovery effort. Reducing the burden of  personal income tax supports workers trying to  get ahead.

This is why the Government is bringing forward  the tax cuts from Stage 2 of its Plan to begin  immediately. These tax cuts will increase the  reward for effort and improve the incentives  to work.

This stage involves three tax changes:

First, the low income tax offset will provide up  to an additional $255 in tax relief as it increases  from $445 to $700.

Second, the top threshold of the 19 per cent  bracket will increase from $37,000 to $45,000.  This will provide up to $1,080 in tax relief.

Third, the top threshold of the 32.5 per cent  bracket will increase from $90,000 to $120,000.  This prevents individuals from facing higher  marginal tax rates in the future and provides

tax relief of up to $1,350.

Taxpayers will receive more money in their  regular pay packets throughout the year and  will receive the full benefit of these changes for  the 2020-21 income year upon assessment.

Tax relief for hard-working  Australians The Government will also provide additional  targeted support to low- and middle-income

earners with a one-off additional benefit from  the low and middle income tax offset (LMITO) in  2020-21. The one-off additional LMITO is worth  up to $1,080 for individuals or $2,160 for dual

income couples. Around 10.1 million individuals  will be eligible for the offset in 2020-21.

The LMITO was due to be removed with the  commencement of Stage 2, but the one-off  additional benefit in 2020-21 will provide

support to households and stimulus to the  economy during the recovery.

This additional tax relief for 2020-21 will reward  hard-working Australians, support consumption  and ease cost of living pressures by putting more  of their money back in their pockets.

Combined with bringing forward the Stage 2  tax cuts, a single person earning $120,000 will  receive a tax cut of $2,745 in 2020-21, compared  with 2017-18 settings.

A dual income family, with both income earners  on $60,000, will receive a combined tax cut  of $4,320 in 2020-21, compared with 2017-18  settings.

Reward for effort Australians expect the tax system to be fair.  The Government is committed to delivering a  simpler tax system that remains progressive,

fosters aspiration and rewards effort.

A progressive personal income tax system  means those with the greatest ability to pay  contribute a larger share of personal income  tax revenue. When the Government’s Plan is  fully implemented in 2024-25, an individual  with taxable income of $200,000, who earns  4.4 times more income than an individual with

taxable income of $45,000, will pay around  10 times more tax.

This is fair and it helps to deliver the services  and the support that Australians rely on.

The Government has legislated the abolition  of the 37 per cent tax bracket, and the  reduction of the 32.5 per cent marginal tax  rate to 30 per cent, from 2024-25. This embeds  genuine reward for effort and means around  95 per cent of taxpayers will face a marginal  tax rate of 30 per cent or less in 2024-25.

More Australians with more money to spend will  grow the economy and create jobs.

Business tax incentives to support  investment and job creation  The Government is supporting Australian  businesses to invest, grow and create more jobs

through targeted tax incentives.

Business investment will support Australia’s  short term economic recovery and longer  term productive capacity and wage growth.  Investment in new technology and new ways of  operating will help firms adapt to the structural  changes induced by COVID-19.

Temporary full expensing The Government is providing a temporary tax  incentive to support new investment and deliver  significant cash flow benefits to businesses.

It will be available to around 3.5 million  businesses (over 99 per cent of businesses)  that employ around 11.5 million workers.  The incentive will apply to around $200 billion

worth of investment, including 80 per cent of  investment in depreciable assets by non-mining  businesses.

From 7:30pm (AEDT) on 6 October 2020 until  30 June 2022, businesses with turnover up to  $5 billion will be able to deduct the full cost of  eligible depreciable assets of any value in the

year they are first used or installed ready for  use. The cost of improvements made during this  period to existing eligible depreciable assets  can also be fully deducted.

Full expensing supports businesses that invest  as it significantly reduces the after-tax cost of  eligible assets, providing a cash flow benefit.  The measure also creates a strong incentive for

businesses to bring forward investment before  it expires. Full expensing builds on the enhanced  instant asset write-off and the accelerated  depreciation previously announced through the  Backing Business Investment incentive.

Eligible businesses that acquire eligible  new or second-hand assets under the  enhanced $150,000 instant asset write-off by  31 December 2020 will also have an extra six  months, until 30 June 2021, to first use or install  those assets.

Full expensing will stimulate investment from its  announcement, supporting economic activity  in 2020-21 and onwards until the measure  concludes. This measure is estimated to deliver  $26.7 billion in tax relief to businesses over the  forward estimates period, and $3.2 billion over  the medium term.

Grace owns an agricultural company, Grace’s Grains  Pty Ltd, which has an aggregated annual turnover  of $20 million for the 2021-22 income year. Grace’s  Grains Pty Ltd purchases a combine harvester for  $600,000, exclusive of GST, on 1 July 2021.

Without temporary full expensing, Grace’s Grains  Pty Ltd would claim a total tax deduction of  around $180,000 for 2021-22, with the remainder  of the cost being depreciated over future years.

Under temporary full expensing, Grace’s  Grains Pty Ltd will instead claim a deduction  of $600,000 for the full cost of the combine  harvester in 2021-22, approximately $420,000  more than before.

At the 2021-22 tax rate for small and medium  companies of 25 per cent, Grace’s Grains Pty  Ltd will pay around $105,000 less tax in 2021-22.  This will improve the company’s cash flow and help  Grace reinvest and grow her business.

Fred’s Medical Services Pty Ltd has an aggregated annual  turnover of $200 million for the 2021-22 income year. Fred’s  Medical Services Pty Ltd engages Shane’s Software Pty Ltd  to create a new medical database for $400,000, exclusive

of GST. The in house software is first installed and used  on 1 July 2021.

Without temporary full expensing, Fred’s Medical  Services Pty Ltd would claim a total tax deduction  of $80,000 for the 2021-22 income year, with the  remainder of the cost being depreciated over future

years.

Under temporary full expensing, Fred’s Medical   Services Pty Ltd will instead claim a deduction of  $400,000 for the full cost of the software in 2021-22,  which is $320,000 more than before. Fred’s Medical  Services Pty Ltd will pay $96,000 less tax in 2021-22.  This will improve the company’s cash flow and help  the business invest and grow.

Increased demand due to temporary full expensing from  customers such as Fred’s Medical Services Pty Ltd also  helps Shane’s Software Pty Ltd to grow, enabling Shane to  hire more staff.

Temporary loss carry-back The Government will also allow companies with  turnover up to $5 billion to offset tax losses  against previous profits on which tax has been

paid to generate a refund. Loss carry-back will  be available to around 1 million companies that  employ up to 8.8 million workers.

Losses incurred in 2019-20, 2020-21 and/or    2021-22 can be carried back against profits  made in or after 2018-19. Eligible companies  may elect to receive a tax refund when they

lodge their 2020-21 and 2021-22 tax returns.

This measure will help companies that were  profitable and tax-paying but now find  themselves in a loss position due to the  COVID-19 pandemic. By allowing them to access  their losses earlier, by way of a cash refund, it  will provide a needed cash flow boost to keep

their business running, retain their workers  and invest with confidence in the future. Loss  carry-back will also promote investment  by encouraging more businesses to take  advantage of full expensing while it is available.

This measure is estimated to deliver $4.9 billion  in tax relief to businesses over the forward  estimates, and $3.9 billion over the medium term.

Supporting Australia’s economic  recovery

Treasury estimates that the temporary full  expensing and the temporary loss carry-back  measures will create around 50,000 jobs by the  end of 2021-22. They will boost GDP by around

$2.5 billion in 2020-21 and $10 billion in  2021-22.

Jamie owns a coffee bean wholesaling company, Jamie’s  Coffee Pty Ltd, which has an aggregated annual turnover  of $51 million. In 2018-19, Jamie’s Coffee Pty Ltd made a tax  profit of $5 million and paid $1.5 million in income tax.

Due to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on customer  demand and its ability to trade, Jamie’s Coffee Pty Ltd  makes a tax loss of $2 million in 2019-20.

Under the treatment of losses in current law, Jamie’s  Coffee Pty Ltd would carry these losses forward until  it made a taxable profit. Under temporary loss carry-back, when the company lodges its 2020-21 company  tax return, it will receive a tax refund of $600,000 in  recognition of this loss and tax paid in 2018-19.

Continuing into 2020-21, reduced trading means  Jamie’s Coffee Pty Ltd makes another tax loss of  $500,000. The company paid sufficient tax in 2018-19 to  also offset the loss from 2020-21 resulting in a further  refund of $150,000.

Jamie’s Coffee Pty Ltd uses its $750,000 refund to help it to  stay in business and retain its employees, and support the  transition back to business as usual.

concrete pump for $1 million, exclusive of GST. The  company’s taxable income for 2021-22 was $600,000  before the purchase. Without temporary full expensing,  Bogong Builders Pty Ltd would claim a tax deduction of  around $300,000, resulting in a taxable profit of $300,000, and

a tax bill of $90,000.

Under temporary full expensing, Bogong Builders Pty Ltd will  instead deduct the full cost of the asset of $1 million, resulting  in a tax loss of $400,000. Under temporary loss carry-back,  Bogong Builders Pty Ltd offsets this tax loss against profits

in 2018-19, resulting in a tax refund of $120,000. Without  the refund, the company may have had to defer  the investment until their cash flow position  recovered, or may not have purchased the

new pump at all.

Attracting and rewarding  further investment

Modernising and expanding Australia’s  tax treaty network

The Government will support the recovery from  COVID-19 by modernising and expanding our  tax treaty network to eliminate double taxation,  settle taxing rights between Australia and other  countries and attract foreign investment and  skilled workers.

Tax treaties benefit both businesses and  individuals. They provide greater certainty for  international transactions, lowering the cost  of doing business overseas. They also provide  relief from double taxation to attract skilled  foreign workers to Australia.

Reducing tax barriers will promote trade and  investment. By attracting foreign investment  and skilled workers, treaties raise productivity,  creating better jobs and supporting higher  incomes.

This initiative will also prioritise refurbishing  Australia’s treaties with key strategic partners  where necessary to maximise the benefits for  Australia’s economy.

Supporting business research  and development

The Government will enhance previously  announced reforms to invest an additional  $2 billion through the Research and  Development Tax Incentive (R&DTI).

For small claimants (turnover less than  $20 million), the Government will increase the  refundable R&D tax offset to 18.5 percentage  points above the claimant’s company tax rate,  and there will be no $4 million cap on annual  cash refunds.

For larger claimants, the Government will  streamline the intensity test from three to two  tiers and increase the non-refundable R&D tax  offset rates. The new rates will be the claimant’s  company tax rate plus 8.5 percentage points  for initial R&D expenditure up to 2 per cent R&D  intensity, and 16.5 percentage points for R&D  expenditure above 2 per cent R&D intensity.

The Government will also proceed with the  increase in the cap on eligible R&D expenditure  from $100 million to $150 million per annum.

These changes apply from 1 July 2021 and will  support more than 11,400 companies that claim  the R&DTI.

Cutting red tape and supporting retraining

FBT record keeping The Government is cutting red tape by allowing  employers to use existing corporate records,  rather than prescribed records, to complete their

fringe benefits tax (FBT) return. This measure  will substantially reduce the time employers and  employees spend on record keeping.

Consulting Services Inc is a consulting  company which wins a contract with a client  based in Geelong. Consulting Services Inc  sends three specialist staff who ordinarily  reside in Sydney to Geelong for nine months  to work on the project. Currently, these staff  are required to complete a declaration which

specifies they maintain homes in Sydney  and provides details of both their home and  temporary location. Consulting Services  Inc will now be able to rely on their existing  records and will no longer require employee  declarations as evidence their employees are

living away from home, saving time for both  Consulting Services Inc and its employees.

Construction Inc sends four engineers from  Adelaide to Brisbane for eight days to work  on the design specifications for its Brisbane  building project. Under current arrangements,

the engineers are required to keep detailed  travel diaries which show the nature, dates  and times of activities undertaken while  away. Construction Inc keeps detailed records

through their corporate travel provider and  internal systems which show the purpose of the  travel, flights taken, the hotel used, the venue  and the schedule. Construction Inc can now

use its existing corporate records to complete  its FBT return and its employees won’t need  to keep a travel diary, saving time for both  Construction Inc and its employees.

Exempting retraining from FBT

The Government is exempting  employer-p rovided retraining activities from  FBT. It will encourage businesses to retrain and  redeploy their workers to new roles within the  business. This measure helps keep Australians

in work and businesses in business.

Also, the Government will consult on allowing  individuals that undertake training at their  own expense which relates to their future  employment, to deduct those costs from their

income. The current rules limit deductions to  training related to current employment.

Retailing Co is closing its  physical store due to COVID-19.  Retailing Co wishes to provide retraining  to its ten redundant sales assistants. It is  offering each staff member $2,000 in retraining  to assist them find new employment. The business

is growing its online sales and has five vacancies  in web design. It is providing web design training to  five of its redundant employees. The remaining five  employees will receive training for positions outside

the organisation.

Currently, the business assesses that it would  be liable for $17,735 in FBT to retrain these  employees. Under this measure, Retailing Co  will be able to retrain these employees

without incurring an FBT liability.

CockatooCleaningCo  operates an office cleaning  business and has an aggregated  annual turnover of $20 million. It provides  car parking benefits to 30 employees valued at  around $48,000 per year. It pays the 47 per cent  fringe benefits tax (FBT) on the grossed-up value of  this cost, which equates to a FBT bill of around $42,566.

In addition, CockatooCleaningCo provides two mobile  phones, valued at $1,000 each, to ten of their staff in the  same year. It pays the 47 per cent FBT on the second  phone they provide, which would result in a FBT bill of
