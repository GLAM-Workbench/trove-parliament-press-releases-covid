PAUL SCARR

It's great to be out here in the Ipswich region with our Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack  and showing him one of the highest growth areas in Queensland and the positive impact that the  Australian Government's HomeBuilder program is having on the ground here. So there's been a  doubling - a doubling - in the number of house and land packages sold here and the vast majority of  Queenslanders buying those land and home packages are new home buyers, young families, getting  an opportunity to become home owners for the first time whilst employing hundreds and hundreds  of tradies building those homes. So wonderful to have you here, Michael.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Thank you very much, Paul, and it's not just Queenslanders buying here, it's also people coming from  other states to buy their first home. Its people who are coming to Queensland to get the good LNP  policies that Paul Scarr is obviously propagating. He is doing a power of good when he goes to  Canberra. Hasn't been there all that long, but let me tell you when Paul Scarr speaks, Canberra  listens. When Paul Scarr has an opinion, Canberra sits up and takes notice and they're certainly  taking notice of the LNP, the Federal Government's HomeBuilder package. 83,587 applications were  received for that program, put in place by Minister for Housing Michael Sukkar and of course we  have extended it because it was so popular. We extended it because builders were telling us that  they just didn't have time to get through all the work and this is going to create work for many  months, if not years into the future. Here, right here at Ripley, you get a house land and package for  around $340,000-$450,000. I know that Taku Hashimoto, who is the developer here, is telling me  that people are flocking to this area here at Ripley in the Ipswich region. And we've been taking  today, Paul and I, with the Ipswich Mayor, Teresa Harding, about what infrastructure is going to be





needed into the future because of course, you can't build residential developments without the right  and proper and sufficient infrastructure. So we've been having a discussion about what we need to  do to further develop this area as far as the infrastructure is concerned and we'll do that.

We'll have those conversations. And I'll go back and following the talks this morning, see what we  can do to develop plans to further enhance this wonderful area. And whether it's Springfield,  whether it's the Greater Ipswich region or right here at Ripley, we want to make sure that for the  900 development applications that have been approved. So they've gone through the council in the  last quarter, 900, can you imagine that? Other areas of Australia would be very envious of what's  happening here and it's happening because people want to come here and live. They see a great  future here.

Not that far from Brisbane but also they can actually work, have a great lifestyle here. I know so  many Brisbanites are thinking of actually selling up, moving out here, selling a place worth about  $800,000, $900,000 in Brisbane, coming out here, either whether they're first home buyers, whether  they're downsizing, it doesn't matter. There are opportunities here that is making it one of the most  liveable places in Australia in which to reside, to set up, whether you're a first home buyer, whatever  the case might be. The HomeBuilder program is providing that opportunity. As Paul Scarr just said,  it's also keeping the tradies on the tools and behind us you can see the tradies hard at work.  Somewhere in the order of 300 or 400 people on this site alone are working on the tools. Some of  them, they're apprentices, they're going to take advantage of the new skills program that Michaelia  Cash and Karen Andrews have got in place as part of our skills, as part of our small business, as part  of our manufacturing policies going forward and that is making a difference on the ground. That is  ensuring that we create the jobs, that we create the opportunities. And, out of the back of COVID,  that's going to be so important.

We've done a great job, we've done a great job as far as COVID is concerned, with the health  outcomes. Of course the economic recovery, it's getting on with the job too and I know I only spoke  to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer yesterday about the number of people back in work, and  that's because of the JobKeeper, that's because of the incentives we've put in place. There are many,  many jobs in regional Australia, many, many jobs in the Ipswich region. Paul's promoting it, I'm  promoting it, HomeBuilder is doing it but, more than that, they're great places in which to live, work,  play and invest and that's what Australians are doing. They're voting with their feet. They're coming  to places like this because of HomeBuilder. They're coming to places like this because they can have  a great time with their family. They don't have to be in the long commute but if they do, if they want  to do that, well and good, too. It's only half-an-hour or so from Brisbane and other places of work.  So no better place in which to set up and I commend what we've done so far.

JOURNALIST

On the issue of climate change, your Deputy David Littleproud has called on the zealots to step back  and allow the adults in the room to develop a plan for net zero by 2050. Do you agree with him?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well look, I agree that there are people on both sides of the debate who, quite frankly, need to  realise that with the net zero emissions, we will get there, but we will get there, as the Prime  Minister said in his National Press Club speech last week, through technology not taxes. Taxes is the  Labor way. Anthony Albanese, in Queensland now with his great chum Kevin Rudd, has already said  that he will - if in Government - he will legislate it. Well, we're not going to legislate it. We're going  to get there through technology not taxes. We're not going to close farms, we're not going to close





factories, we're not going to put people out of the work in the great resources sector that has done  Queensland so much good for so many years and will continue to do so many good for so many  years. We're not going to put those people out of work. We don't say to them, "We undervalue your  job because we want to a get to a target 29 years from now." What we will do is we'll do it in a  practical, pragmatic way without whacking the economy with another great big carbon tax. That's  the Labor way. We're not going to go down that path.

JOURNALIST

Do you agree with him that Barnaby Joyce and Matt Canavan are, as he described, zealots?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

I don't know whether he described those two as zealots. I don't think he actually said, "They are  zealots". But what we need to do is exercise a bit of calm. The Prime Minister hasn't said that he's  going to put in a great big new tax. That's the Labor way. We're not going to do that. Barnaby and  Matt both know that. David Littleproud, of course, he knows it, too. David's the Minister for  Agriculture. He's not going to see agriculture unfairly impacted upon by a climate target 29 years  from now. What we want to do is get to those targets. We're already meeting and beating what  we've said we're going to do as far as our international obligations.

We're always making sure that we have lower emissions, but we don't do it in such a way that we  put people out of work. We don't do it in such a way that we make household power costs higher.  We do it in a practical way. We do it through technology, we don't do it through taxes. That's the  Labor way, Barnaby knows that, Matt Canavan knows that and so does David and the rest of the LNP  team.

JOURNALIST

What message would you have for Mr Joyce and Mr Canavan, who have already declared that they  won't be supporting the target?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, there's targets there that we will get there through technology not taxes. Barnaby knows that.  Matt knows that. We will get there through practical moves but the biggest thing in town at the  moment, the biggest thing that people are talking about, the barbecue stopper, is the vaccine.  We've acquired 150 million doses. That's what people are concerned about. That's what people are  worried about and they can be self-assured and rest assured that the Federal Government has their  back - we have 150 million doses. We're rolling out the program. The vaccine strategy, starting later  this month. Everybody will get that vaccine free of charge and we'll make sure that we vaccinate the  South Pacific as well because that's what good neighbours do. That's the most important thing at the  moment for Australians, for Australian families, and they know they can be very, very rest assured  that we've got their back when it comes to the strategy, when it comes to the vaccine strategy.  That's what people are talking about. They're not talking about zero net emissions and I appreciate  that that's a big story for the Canberra commentary and I appreciate that we need to do our part, we  need to play our part. And sure, climate is important, but the most important thing right now is the  vaccine and the rollout and we're getting on with that job.







JOURNALIST

Just finally, one more on fuel security. How concerned are you about ExxonMobil's decision to shut  down its Altona refinery? And are you concerned that Australia will become more vulnerable if it  becomes dependent on imported, refined fuels?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, we are very dependent on, of course, fuel coming into Australia but we've also got a strategy  for fuel security and Angus Taylor is working very hard to ensure that we've got the right amount of  fuel in the right places to ensure that Australia's mining, agriculture and of course, people who need  to get from point A to B - and that's all of us, have the right amount of fuel at the right time. And of  course, fuel security is important to Australia and that's why we've got a plan in place. That's why  we've got policies in place and Angus Taylor is driving that and doing a good job.

JOURNALIST

Sorry, just going back to the emissions target, do you believe that farmers should be excluded from  that?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, what we're going to do, as the Prime Minister quite clearly enunciated in his National Press  Club speech, is we're not going to unfairly impact regional Australia. And of course, all the farmers  are in regional Australia. So whether they're farmers, whether they're miners, whether they're Mr  and Mrs Average running a household budget, we're not going to unfairly impact on them. We will  get there through technology, not taxes. 29 years, it's a long time. There'll be a lot of inventions in  that time. Think back 29 years ago as to where we've progressed in that intervening period from  then to now as far as better vehicles, better fuel, all sorts of things as far as even in these houses.  The builders were telling me how they're insulating the house better too, so that people don't have  high heating costs, that they don't have high air conditioning costs, and all those have been the  progress of invention. And we will get there, through technology not taxes.

JOURNALIST

Deputy PM, with the rental crisis that's going on in South East Queensland at the moment, is the  extension of this HomeBuilders grant supposed to have, or expected to have, a flow on effect with  those people?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, it has a flow on effect right throughout the whole community. And I know that for those  people who are looking for their first home, there's very affordable homes here. So when you lower  the cost of the home and you have jobs in regional Australia, jobs in South East Queensland, there  are plenty of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs - in fact, the Regional Australia Institute has identified  54,000 jobs in regional Australia right now. There are jobs here. We encourage people to take them.  I'm very encouraged by the recent economic prospects where so many people who had lost their  jobs through the initial phase of COVID have now returned to work. And that's why we're making  sure that we can make life more affordable for all of them through the HomeBuilder. So whether  you're a tradie building the home or whether you're looking for your first home or indeed you're





looking to downsize, whatever the case might be, there's a home in South East Queensland right  here in Ripley, right here in Springfield, right here in the Ipswich region for you. They're building  them. You can see the work going on behind me. Paul Scarr's promoting it. I'm here promoting it.  HomeBuilder has been a great scheme. It's provided that hope and opportunity for somebody who  wants to get in to their first home. To beat that rental cycle but also, of course, we're providing relief  for those people who are renters. We want to make sure that people can be very much able to  manage their affairs, their financial affairs, so that they can get back on their feet. COVID has taken  such a toll on the economy. We've backed the economy to the tune of hundreds of billions of  dollars. We will go on providing the necessary assistance but, of course, with JobKeeper and  JobSeeker, they were always scalable. They were always temporary, they were targeted. They were  the right measures at the right time, but it's time for Australians to get back to work. It's time for us  to do what we can as a nation, to rebuild after COVID. We've done very, very well. We haven't had a  death this year through COVID. We've only had one in recent months and that was a historic death.  909 people have died through COVID and that is very, very sad and unfortunate - for those people  that didn't have the loved one around their Christmas table last festive season - very, very sad and  we mourn for their loss. But when you compare what Australia's been able to do, because  Australians have, thankfully, listened to the best possible medical advice and the Government has  too, we have kept Australians safe. We have kept the country largely COVID-free and I say to  Australians thank you for doing what you've done so far. Get that jab, get that vaccine and we will  do this together.

JOURNALIST

You noted as well that obviously you wanted to continue supporting the community through  Government funding. Do you think the dip of $10,000 in the grant was a feasible way to do that?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, it was always going to be temporary and scalable. It was an amount of $25,000. Yes, when it  went so well, we extended it. We extended it to the tune of $15,000. Let me tell you, for those  people who missed out or didn't qualify or didn't get their paperwork in for the first tranche of the  funding grants, then they were very pleased that we extended it for another three months. But we  can't keep these measures going forever. Again, we will continue to back the economy, like we have  done all the way through. We'll continue to listen, whether it's to construction, the housing industry,  whether it's aviation, whether it's the tourism sector. I know Paul and I have had a number of  discussions about how we can help Queensland in general. It's been hard hit, of course, by COVID, as  has every state, every territory. We have to make sure we've got the best possible measures and  policies in place. We have had so far. Josh Frydenberg has done a power of good to make sure that  we've provided the right assistance at the right time in a temporary way to get Australia through  COVID. We're now building out the back of it. We've got the 150 million doses. Greg Hunt has done a  power of good to make sure that we've got the right amount of doses. We need Australians to get  that jab. Far better to get that jab and to make sure that they're right than be worried weeks from  then if they didn't get it in an intensive care unit and thinking, "Why didn't I get that vaccine?" So it's  pretty simple, pretty easy. Get the jab, do it for Australia, do it for somebody you know. Do it for the  loved ones around you. Do it for somebody you may not even know. It's so important and I know  that Greg Hunt, acting on the best possible medical advice, has secured those doses, a very good  thing for Australians.
