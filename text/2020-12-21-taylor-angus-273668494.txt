ELECTRICITY PRICES TO FALL IN 2021



Electricity prices will continue to fall in the coming years according to the latest report  from the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC), confirming the Morrison  Government’s strong action to bring down electricity prices is having the desired effect.

The AEMC’s 2020 Residential Electricity Price Trends Report forecasts that, on average,  residential electricity prices will fall by 8.7 per cent to 2022-23, saving households more  than $100 annually.

Reductions are forecast across the entire National Electricity Market (NEM), with a drop  of more than $200 expected for households in South Australia.

Falling wholesale costs are the primary driver of the price and bill reductions, with the  AEMC predicting that wholesale costs will drop by more than $150 (27.4 per cent)  during the period.

With wholesale prices making up around a third of retail energy bills, it is the  Government’s strong expectation that those lower prices will be passed on to Australian  families and small businesses.

The forecast lower prices come on the heels of ongoing policy action from the  Government to lower energy costs and improve outcomes for families and small  businesses, which has seen wholesale prices falling for each of the last 15 months, and  seven consecutive quarters of year-on-year retail price reductions. These actions  include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ introducing a price cap to protect loyal customers from being  ripped off;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ prioritising the delivery of the reliable generation and transmission  to keep prices low;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ getting rid of sneaky late payment penalties; and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ passing the ‘big stick’ legislation to hold the energy companies to

account and require them to pass on cost reductions to their  customers.

Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said lower costs were good  for the economy and consumers as Australia emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Cheaper electricity puts more money in the pockets of hard-working Australians,”  Minister Taylor said.

“After what was been a tough year for everyone, news that electricity prices are  expected to continue falling in 2021 is a welcome relief.

“The Government is constantly working to help Australians pay less for their energy bills  and this report confirms that our actions are having an impact.

“Electricity prices should not hold households and small businesses back, which is why  our Government will continue to work hard to keep prices down and the lights on.”

Even though prices are forecast to fall over the next three years, the AEMC predicts a  slight increase in prices and bills in 2022-23, which it attributes to the closure of the  Liddell power station.

To protect families and businesses against the risk of price rises, the Government has  outlined its expectations of the electricity sector to deliver 1,000 megawatts of new  dispatchable energy before Liddell closes in 2023.

“The Government is on the side of consumers,” Minister Taylor said. “We are taking  strong action to ensure Australians are paying less.”
