HAVE YOUR SAY ON THE WESTERN SYDNEY AIRPORT M ETRO PROJECT

The community can have its say on the Sydney Metro - Western Sydney Airport railway  project, with the Environmental Impact Statement for the mega project now on public  exhibition.

Federal Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure Alan Tudge said the  project would set the foundation for Greater Western Sydney for generations to come.

“Construction will start before the end of the year and will inject billions into the NSW  economy and support 14,000 jobs,” Mr Tudge said.

“It’s crucial we get this underway right now to help NSW on the other side of COVID and  deliver this game-changing, city-shaping infrastructure as soon as possible.”

New South Wales Minister for Transport and Roads Andrew Constance said the 23 -kilometre driverless metro will link the new Western Sydney Aerotropolis with the  Western Sydney International (Nancy-Bird Walton) Airport and St Marys, delivering major  benefits for Greater Western Sydney.

“There will be six new metro stations at St Marys, Orchard Hills, Luddenham, Airport  Business Park, Western Sydney International Airport and the Western Sydney  Aerotropolis,” Mr Constance said.

“Trains will arrive up to every five minutes in the peak period in each direction as the  initial operating capacity so customers won’t need a timetable - they’ll just turn up and  go.”

New South Wales Minister for Jobs, Investment, Tourism and Western Sydney Stuart  Ayres said local residents will reap the benefits of this investment, well before the first  train hits the tracks.

“Not only will we see a massive investment in local jobs during the construction, but we’ll  also see big business move into the Aerotropolis, driving economic activity and creating  even more jobs,” Mr Ayres said.

“The new metro line will significantly reduce local traffic, by taking about 110,000 vehicle  journeys off local roads every day by 2056.”

Federal Member for Hume Angus Taylor said the number of trains travelling each way,  per hour, on the line would rise toward 20 in the future.

“We expect to be moving up to 7,740 people an hour in each direction when services  start, with plenty of room to add more trains as the region grows,” Mr Taylor said.

“Passengers will enjoy a five-minute journey from the airport to the Western Sydney  Aerotropolis. It will take around 20 minutes to travel from St Marys to the Aerotropolis  and about 15 minutes from the airport to St Marys - where customers can interchange  with the T1 Western Line and the rest of Sydney’s rail network.

Federal Member for Lindsay Melissa McIntosh said the Sydney Metro, Western Sydney  Airport, was a key commitment of the Western Sydney Deal, a 20-year agreement  signed in March 2018 by the Australian and NSW governments and eight Western  Sydney councils.

“The project is planned to open at the same time as passenger services start at the  airport,” Mrs McIntosh said.

“It will be fully accessible with level access between platforms and trains and safety  features like platform screen doors, which keep people and objects like prams away from  the tracks.”

New South Wales Member for Mulgoa Tanya Davies said the transport link will support  population growth, while providing fast and efficient accessibility between residential  centres and employment hubs across Greater Sydney.

“Western Sydney is growing rapidly and is currently home to more than two million  people, and is projected to grow to over three million by 2036. This project will help  support that growth, and encourage businesses to set up in this growing hub,” Mrs  Davies said.

New South Wales Member for Camden Peter Sidgreaves said building new metro  stations in Greater Western Sydney provides an exciting opportunity to create world -class places that will shape our city’s future.

“I am encouraging everyone to have their say and review the Environmental Impact  Statement, as the project will support nationally significant growth in Western Sydney, for

years to come,” Mr Sidgreaves said.

The community will also be able to take a look around the new Luddenham Station using  their mobile devices. An interactive portal has been set up as community engagement  tool during Covid and can be found at: www.sydneymetro.info/wsa

Construction will start before the end of 2020.
