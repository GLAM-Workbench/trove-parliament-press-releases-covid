$2.47B TO LOCK IN LOWER ENERGY PRICES, REDUCE EMISSIONS AND BOOST OUR  ECONOMY

The Morrison Government is continuing to deliver on its commitment to provide reliable,  secure and affordable energy to all Australians as part of our Economic Recovery Plan for  Australia.

Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, The Hon Angus Taylor MP, says “Our 2020-21 Budget initiatives will help to lock in lower energy prices while simultaneously  developing the backbone of a reliable, lower emissions National Electricity Market (NEM)  for the next decade and beyond.”

“As we rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government will also accelerate the  development of low emission technologies to help reduce emissions, strengthen energy  security and support jobs,” Minister Taylor said.

ENERGY

The Government is continuing to deliver a more affordable and reliable electricity system  for Australians through measures to lower bills, secure our grid and drive investment in  new energy infrastructure. This includes:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Up to $250 million to accelerate major transmission projects such as Marinus  Link, Project EnergyConnect and VNI West to the next stage. Together with the  Government’s existing support for HumeLink and the QNI Interconnector, this  means we are accelerating all priority transmission projects, creating thousands  of new jobs, putting downward pressure on prices and shoring up the reliability  of the grid;

Ã¯ÂÂ· A $53.6 million microgrid program to support the development of pilot projects  in regional Australia, building on the success of the current Regional and Remote  Communities Reliability Fund. This will help deliver more affordable reliable  power in regional communities across Australia;

Ã¯ÂÂ· Helping connect the North West Minerals Province (NWMP) near Mount Isa to  the NEM through further support for the CopperString high voltage transmission  line. This will allow major users in the NWMP to access reliable and more  affordable energy supply, and encourage further investment in mining and  processing in the region;

Ã¯ÂÂ· $28.5 million to deliver cheap and reliable energy to Western Australians through  the South West Interconnected System Big Battery project and a WA-based  microgrids program for remote and indigenous communities;

Ã¯ÂÂ· $52.2 million to improve energy efficiency, lower bills and deliver abatement,  including $24 million to fund building upgrades and reduce energy costs for  community groups and for small and medium hotels; and

Ã¯ÂÂ· $4.9 million over two years to improve cyber security in the energy sector and  prepare government and industry for future threats.

FUEL SECURITY

The Government is strengthening Australia’s long-term fuel security through a $250.7  million investment in new diesel fuel storage facilities and progressing reforms to boost  the resilience of fuel supply and support local refineries.

This will create up to 1,000 new jobs, increase our diesel stockholdings by 40 per cent,  and contribute towards our International Energy Agency (IEA) obligation while also  protecting Australian motorists from higher prices at the pump.

GAS

We will deliver a gas-fired recovery and ensure Australian gas is working for all  Australians through a comprehensive 13-point action plan.

On top of the $42 million of investments to unlock supply, $10.9 million will be invested  to strengthen gas infrastructure planning and deliver market reform to lower the price  of gas for households and manufacturers.

This includes developing an inaugural National Gas Infrastructure Plan (NGIP) to identify  priority infrastructure projects, and options to boost the Wallumbilla Hub into a more  transparent Australian Gas Hub, like the Henry Hub in the United States.

EMISSIONS REDUCTION

The Budget also sets out measures that demonstrate how the Government is reducing  emissions through technology, not taxes, including:  Ã¯ÂÂ· $1.4 billion over 10 years for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency to support  the Government’s Technology Investment Roadmap, by accelerating the

development of new and emerging technologies to reduce emissions;

UNDER EMBARGO



Ã¯ÂÂ· $70.2 million over five years to activate Australia’s first regional hydrogen export  hub and facilitate research collaborations and international supply chain studies  to boost Australia’s hydrogen industry;

Ã¯ÂÂ· $95.4 million for a Technology Co-Investment Fund to implement  recommendations from the King Review to support businesses in the  manufacturing, industrial, transport and land sectors to invest in low emissions  technologies to unlock energy and emissions savings and create jobs;

Ã¯ÂÂ· $50 million investment in the Carbon Capture Use and Storage Development  Fund to pilot carbon capture projects that will help dramatically cut emissions  from large industrial facilities;

Ã¯ÂÂ· $74.5 million over four years to enable Australian consumers and businesses to  adopt future fuel and vehicle technologies in Australia, including hydrogen,  electric, and bio-fuelled vehicles; and

Ã¯ÂÂ· $45.2 million for the Government to progress reforms to make it easier and  cheaper for business to participate in the Emissions Reduction Fund, and to  support investment in offshore clean energy generation and transmission.

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all Australians, increasing the financial burden on  households and businesses across the country.

The Morrison Government will continue to deliver practical measures that guarantee  reliable and affordable energy, stimulate jobs and reduce emissions, without imposing  new costs on households, businesses or the economy.

The Government’s investments in electricity, fuel security, gas and emissions reduction is  expected to create more than 135,000 new jobs across Australia as part of rebuilding our  economy and securing Australia’s future.
