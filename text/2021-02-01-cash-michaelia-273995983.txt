SUPPORTING WESTERN AUSTRALIA THROUGH COVID-19

The Morrison Government will lift mutual obligation requirements for job seekers in the Perth  Metropolitan, Peel and South West regions from today 1 February 2021 to Tuesday 9 February  2021.

This follows an announcement by the Western Australian Government that the three listed  regions are under a five-day lockdown to curb a COVID-19 outbreak in the area.

No job seeker in the affected areas will face payment suspension or financial penalties for failing  to meet their mutual obligation requirements such as not being able to attend appointments or  activities.

Job seekers are still being encouraged to remain connected to employment services to ensure they  are supported to access the full range of assistance including mental health services, if required.

These arrangements will apply to job seekers in jobactive, Online Employment Services,  Disability Employment Services and participants in ParentsNext.

The Morrison Government will continue to closely monitor the situation in Western Australia.

More information about mutual obligations requirements can be found at  www.dese.gov.au/covid-19/job-seekers.
