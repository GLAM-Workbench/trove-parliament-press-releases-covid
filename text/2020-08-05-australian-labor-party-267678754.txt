MORRISON GOVERNMENT’S AGED CARE PPE FAILURES LAID BARE



Concerning new evidence about the use of PPE in St Basil’s has highlighted the Morrison

Government’s unacceptable failure to prepare Victorian nursing homes for COVID-19.



A report this morning indicated no PPE was being used in the St Basil’s nursing home in the critical

days after the first case of COVID-19 was found in the facility.



“The times that we were going in to visit my mother-in-law there was zero PPE, even after the first

person contracted on the 9th of July they weren’t wearing PPE until the 14th of July.”

This concerning evidence follows alarming reports that the Morrison Government did no audit of  nursing homes’ stock of PPE, despite more than 1,300 providers requesting access to the national  stockpile.

The Morrison Government triaged aged care providers access to the PPE stockpile in the weeks  before COVID-19 outbreaks grew in Victorian nursing homes.

The Minister must come clean on whether he is confident St Basil’s nursing home had enough PPE  to prevent an outbreak of COVID-19.

This latest report comes on top of evidence given yesterday in the Select Committee on COVID-19  which revealed even now just 100,000 aged care workers have completed the Morrison  Government’s training modules in infection control and how to use PPE.

This represents less than one in three aged care workers. Why did this completely inadequate take-up not raise serious alarm bells?

We have seen the devastating impact of COVID-19 outbreaks in aged care in Australia and across  the globe.

Why was the Morrison Government not better prepared for outbreaks that would impact our nation’s  most vulnerable?



Australia’s aged care system was broken before the COVID-19 pandemic and this is only putting  extra stress on the system.

The Morrison Government must do better for our most vulnerable older Australians.

The Morrison Government must learn from the past few months and act to prevent further outbreaks  in the aged care system.
