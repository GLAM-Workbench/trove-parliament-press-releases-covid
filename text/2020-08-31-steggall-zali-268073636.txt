MEDIA RELEASE: Climate Change Bill Relaunch

Zali Steggall OAM MP has relaunched her Climate Change Bill, calling for the Morrison government to  adopt sensible climate change legislation that will align national policy with state governments’ and the  private sector’s commitment to net zero by 2050.

Ms Steggall will table the legislative climate framework in the House of Representatives on 9 November -  the same date Australia was expected at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow to update its  emission reduction commitment under the Paris Agreement.

The Climate Change (National Framework for Adaptation and Mitigation) Bill 2020 has been updated  following consultation with business groups, environmental organisations, law experts and federal MPs.  The legislation now adopts the government’s Technology Investment Roadmap, released in May, which will  assist in identifying and developing low emissions technologies.

The Bill will be seconded by Rebekha Sharkie MP and is supported by the Australian Business Council,  Atlassian, the Climate Council, Australian Energy Council and WWF Australia, among others. It has also  been endorsed by prominent leaders including Christiana Figuerres, former UN climate chief who oversaw  the Paris Agreement, Economist Professor Ross Garnaut and US Climate Scientist Dr Michael Mann.

The Climate Act Now website, www.climateactnow.com.au has been relaunched, calling on Australians to  support the bill and add their name to the many signatories from every electorate in Australia.

Zali Steggall OAM MP, Independent for Warringah:  “The Climate Change Act gives us the opportunity to rebuild from the COVID-19 crisis in a sustainable way,  future proofing our jobs and economy.

We are seeing UK, Germany and major energy corporations including Woodside, BHP, AGL and BP  committing to net zero by 2050. It’s time for the Morrison government to step up and join these leaders.

Unfortunately, since the pandemic engulfed our country the federal government has instead focussed on a  gas-led recovery that will see Australia left behind.”

Rebekha Sharkie MP, Independent for Mayo  “It is my hope that this legislation will break through the partisan politics and that the Australian  community will get behind Zali’s campaign at climateactnow.com.au and put pressure on their Federal  members to call for a conscience vote.”







Helen Haines MP, Independent for Indi  “I’ve worked with Zali to ensure that regional Australia is represented in this Bill. This is critical because our  renewable power stations are being built in regional Australia. This represents an enormous opportunity  for everyday people, if we put communities at the centre. The Climate Change Bill gives certainty to  regional communities that they will not just be included in the conversation, but that they will be placed at  heart of our emerging zero-carbon economy.”

Support for Climate Change Bill

Professor Ross Garnaut  “Zali Steggall’s Climate Change Bill provides an opportunity for the Australian Federal Parliament to move  decisively beyond the Climate Wars. Being introduced by a Member of Parliament from outside the partisan  divide, it can pass without any of the Parties of government backing down from explicit electoral  commitments.

Mike Cannon-Brookes, Atlassian  “This is a smart bill, and the exact type of action we need to change Australia’s international reputation on  climate.”

Jennifer Westacott, The Business Council Australia chief  “I reckon if we could get the two political parties to agree to that and legislate it, we would have made a  massive advance in this country because we would know where we’re going."

Dr Penny Sackett, Former Chief Scientist   “The bill recognises that effective governance is well informed, by establishing an independent Climate  Change Commission to assess risks and advise Parliament. And it acknowledges that good governance is  transparent and accountable, by establishing procedures for monitoring and reporting.”

Dr Michael Mann, US Scientist   “Australia needs a proactive approach to dealing with climate change impacts. That's precisely what the  people’s Climate Change Bill being introduced as a Private Member’s Bill by Independent Zali Steggall  provides.”

Christina Figuerres, former UN climate chief who oversaw the Paris Agreement  “All states and territories have 2050 net zero targets, as do 73 other nations, including Britain and Canada.  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson would welcome Australia joining these ranks… and giving  consideration to the British model of using an independent expert body to advise government on five -yearly  carbon budgets en route to net zero by 2050. Independent MP Zali Steggall’s private members’ bill does  exactly that.”

Climate Change (National Framework for

Adaptation and Mitigation) Bill 2020



Climate change is real for Australia, with immediate and deepening risks to our natural  environment, economy and way of life. Last summer’s unprecedented bushfires are a mark of the  worst of those risks, and how they will affect some communities more than others. But there are  also opportunities to prosper, given our enormous natural, human and financial wealth.

This Act would ensure Australia has a clear and positive national response to the challenges of  climate change. That is what a large and growing majority of Australians call for, and what Australia  needs.

It will ensure that Australia has:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A Net Zero emissions target by 2050, getting there through emissions reduction plans and  emissions budgets

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Risk assessments and adaptation plans, so that the different parts of our continent and  economy know the risks of climate change and can prepare for them

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Technology readiness assessment, so that we know the existing and emerging ways we can  reduce emissions, with the least risk and cost

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ An independent advisory commission (IAC), that can advise the Government, transparently  and independently, on our national needs and plans.

In putting this law in place, Australia will be amongst several other countries with effective climate  laws in place, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and New Zealand.



1. Net zero emissions by 2050

We need to limit global warming to as close to 1.5 degrees as possible. To do this, science tells us  that we must reduce our emissions to ‘Net Zero’ by no later than 2050. Net Zero does not mean no  emissions. It means we need to balance the carbon we put into the atmosphere with what we draw  down through tree planting and soils - just like balancing a budget.

The Climate Act will help Australia by setting that target and helping us get there. It will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Set Net Zero emissions by 2050 in law

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Establish a process to review the Net Zero target every 5 years as things change

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Require five-year emissions budgets to reduce emissions smoothly through to Net Zero

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Require five-year emissions reduction plans to ensure that Australia meets those emissions  budgets, and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Establish principles of fairness and equity to guide those budgets and plans.

2.   National risk assessments and adaptation plans

Australia is starting to experience more severe and frequent bushfires, droughts, floods and  heatwaves. While we cannot avoid their impacts, we can better prepare for them.

The Climate Act would:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Require an annual National Climate Change Risk Assessment from the IAC, reviewing risks to  Australia’s economy, society and environment, and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Require five-year plans to adapt to those risks, both nationally and for regional and  economic sectors (such as agriculture, biodiversity, national parks, marine parks, health,  energy, transport, services, education, planning, construction, infrastructure etc).



3.  Technology assessments

To succeed with these plans, Australia will need every technology that can help reduce our  emissions. Australia may also benefit by exporting technologies to other countries to help the globe  get to Net Zero.

To do this, the Climate Act adopts the Government’s annual Low Emissions Technology Statements.  These would:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Provide an update of global technology developments

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Publicise existing and potential technologies that can help reduce our emissions, and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Demonstrate the economics of substituting low-emission for high-emission technologies.

Example technologies are hydrogen, pumped hydro energy storage, ‘virtual power plants’ that link  smaller batteries and rooftop solar panels into a single energy resource, electric and alternative fuel  vehicles, waste recycling plants, and low-emission cement.



4.  An independent advisory commission

The Climate Act introduces the Independent Advisory Commission as an independent body to assess  risks and technologies, advise Government and monitor climate change actions and impacts.

The IAC will work with the Government in a transparent and accountable way:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The IAC will assess climate risks, new technologies, and recommend adaptation plans and  emissions budgets that are fair and equitable across generations, regions and industries

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Government will present plans and budgets to Parliament, with reasons for any  variation from the IAC recommendations, and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The IAC will report annually on progress against Australia’s emissions targets, technology  goals and adaptation and emissions reduction plans.

* * *

The Act will enable Australia to make an immediate, positive and nationally supported response to  the risks, challenges and opportunities of climate change.

















Background on the Climate Act

The COVID-19 crisis has given us a prelude to the kind of widespread disruption a  warming climate will cause. Combined with the climate change fuelled 2019-20 Black  Summer bushfires, Australia has been pushed into an economic recession for the first  time in over two decades.

It is therefore imperative tackle climate change and the economic recovery from the  virus at the same time. Fortunately, the recovery offers an opportunity to direct  stimulus to climate-smart initiatives. Climate-smart initiatives like energy efficiency  upgrades for manufacturing, transmission, and renewable energy zones will provide  new jobs, productivity and economic growth, above and beyond a business as usual  approach.

The Climate Act (the Act) is integral to this next phase of our economic recovery. It  will provide the plans for these initiatives and will send a signal to businesses and  investors - with its long-term net zero target by 2050 - unlocking the massive amount  of capital we will need to get our economy moving again.

Following a consultation period with stakeholders, the Act has been amended in  various sections to improve its interpretation, intent, and effectiveness. Some  sections have been added to; others simplified.

The core pillars of a net zero emissions target by 2050, five-yearly emissions budgets,  multi-sectoral emissions reduction plans, national risk assessments and national  adaptation plans, remain the fundamental elements.

Of note, the amendments clarify the role of the Commission to advise and  recommend courses of action to the Government and Minister of the day.  Amendments also made broaden the Commission’s membership, integrate the  Government’s Technology Investment Roadmap and extend obligations to affected  communities. (For more information on the changes, please see Table 1 below).





2



In June 2020, the Government released the Technology Investment Roadmap  Discussion Paper (the Roadmap). The goal of the Roadmap is stated “to bring a  strategic and system-wide view to future investments in low emissions  technologies.” The Roadmap establishes a process to develop the low emissions  technologies that will be critical over the next several decades.

Nevertheless, the Roadmap alone does not provide a comprehensive response to  climate change. There is no emissions reductions budgeting, long-term target,  adaptation plans, and inadequate transparency and accountability measures. (For  more information on the gaps of the Roadmap see Table 2 below).

However, it does have a useful function in assisting the development of low  emissions technologies needed for further climate action. Once integrated with the  Act, the Roadmap is complementary. The Roadmap will now inform emissions  reductions plans in the Bill.

The Low Emissions Technology Statements, a subset of the Technology Investment  Roadmap, have also been included in the Act. They will provide feedback to the  public on progress towards developing these technologies. These statements will be  part of the Commission’s reporting requirements which also includes on progress  targets and adaptation plan implementation.

With the Climate Act, we can safeguard our future, right our economic course, and  enjoy prosperity for many years to come. We cannot get this Bill passed without your  support…. Our future depends on it.

Table 2: Summary comparison of the Climate Change (National Framework for Adaptation and  Mitigation) Bill 2020   and the Technology Investment Roadmap discussion paper

Climate Change Bill Technology Investment Roadmap discussion paper

Objects Objects in section 3 include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ recognising climate change

requires a planned  transition towards a net  zero emissions economy  and the implementation of  adaptation measures

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ decisions under the Act

should be consistent with  limiting the increase in  global warming to well  below 2Ã¢ÂÂ and pursuing  efforts to limit it to 1.5Ã¢ÂÂ  above pre-industrial levels

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ establishing a framework to

address climate change,  including setting a target for  achieving net zero emissions  by 2050 or earlier

The Roadmap sets out several goals and a ‘clear vision’  as follows:

‘to bring a strategic and system-wide view to future  investments in low emissions technologies’ (p. 3)

‘to ensure Australia remains at the forefront of the  global low emissions technological innovation. Driving  down the cost of deploying low emissions technologies  to a point where they are competitive with existing  alternatives will deliver meaningful reductions in global  emissions.’ (p. 7)

‘…for Australia to have reliable, secure and affordable  energy to power the domestic economy, and  economy-wide technologies deployed to maximise the  employment and growth opportunities of the global  shift towards lower emissions’ (p. 13). To realise this  vision, technology investments will pursue the  following overarching goals:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ improving affordability of energy for Australian  households and businesses

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ maintaining security and reliability of energy  supply

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ meeting, and where possible beating, Australia’s  emissions reduction commitments and helping  other countries to lower their emissions through  the export of low emissions technologies,  products and services and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ seeking employment and growth opportunities,  particularly in regional areas, arising from  increasing global demand for low emissions  energy and products.  (p. 13)

5



Emissions reduction  target  Sets a target of net zero  emissions by 2050 (section 22)

Minister may vary (but not  reduce) this target by legislative  instrument, after receiving  advice from the Climate Change  Commission. The Commission  must review the target on  request from the Minister and  when emissions budgets are set  (sections 22-26). The  Commission may only  recommend a change if  ‘significant change has occurred’  as set out in subsection 24(2).

No specific emissions long-term reduction target.

Does mention existing 2030 target under the Paris  Agreement (p. 3) and notes that: ‘Parties to the Paris  Agreement, including Australia, have collectively  committed to the goal of reaching global peak  greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and  balancing anthropogenic emissions sources and sinks  (‘net zero’ emissions) in the second half of this century’  (p. 26)

States that the Government’s technology investments  will target outcomes over the short, medium and long  term (p. 29)

Governance  arrangements

Establishes a Climate Change  Commission consisting of a  Chair, the Chief Scientist and five  other members (section 36).  Members must have member/s  with certain experience or  knowledge (including, but not  limited to, technology  development and diffusion).

Members are appointed by the  Minister with approval by the  Parliamentary Joint Committee  on Climate Adaptation and  Mitigation established by the Bill  (section 38)

The Commission is a PGPA Act  listed entity and is not subject to  direction by the Government in  relation to the performance of  its functions, or exercise of its  powers (section 35)

Minister sits at the top of the governance  arrangements (set out on p. 5) and is advised by a  Ministerial Reference Panel ‘composed of industry,  private investment, government and research leaders’,  which advises the Minister in the preparation of Low  Emissions Technology Statements. ‘While the  reference panel will advise generally on technology  priorities, its primary role will be identifying pathways  for efficient deployment of new technologies’. (p. 7).

This panel has already been appointed and is being led  by the Chief Scientist (Dr Alan Finkel). Other members  are: Drew Clarke, Grant King, Shemara  Wikramanayake, Alison Watkins, Ben Wilson, and Jo  Evans (ex officio). (p. 4)

A ‘Technology Investment Roadmap Task Force’ will  lead collaboration across Commonwealth departments  and agencies (p. 5). No further detail is provided.

Guiding principles for  decision-makers  Decision-makers must consider  the guiding principles (in sections

9-16) when performing functions  or duties or exercising powers  under the Act or other  prescribed Acts.

No direct equivalent, although there are ‘overarching  goals’ that technology investments will pursue (as  outlined earlier).

6



Emissions reduction plan The Minister must prepare an  emissions reduction plan setting  out policies and strategies for  meeting each emissions budget.  In preparing the plan, the  Minister must obtain and  consider advice of State and  Territory climate ministers and  the Commission. Plans are tabled  in Parliament and published on  the Commission website  (section 30)

The Final Roadmap and first Low Emissions Technology  Statement will be the ‘cornerstone of Australia’s long  term emissions reduction strategy, to be delivered  ahead of COP26. The long term strategy will consider  how various technologies may reduce our emissions  without damaging our economy’ (p. 3).

Consultation will occur before first Technology  Statement is delivered to Parliament in Q3 2030 (p. 4).  No specific requirement for final Roadmap, Technology  Statements, or long term emissions strategy to be  tabled in Parliament or published anywhere in  particular.

Emissions budgets

(These are a cap on the  amount of greenhouse  gases that can be emitted,  generally over a five-year  period. They act as  stepping stones towards  the 2050 target)

The Minister must set emissions  budgets (by legislative  instrument) on advice from the  Commission (sections 26-29)

The Minister must ensure that  the net accounting emissions for  an emissions budget period do  not exceed the emissions budget  for the period (subsection 26(5))

The Commission prepares  progress reports for the Minister  at the end of the emissions  budget period. The Minister  prepares a statement in  response which is tabled in  Parliament (section 29)

‘The Government will set measurable economic goals  for specific priority technologies and track our progress  towards them.’ The first specific goal is set out in the  Roadmap as ‘producing hydrogen at below $2 per  kilogram’. (p. 13)

Unclear how other goals will be set, but ‘Low  Emissions Technology Statements’ will be published  each year ‘to communicate progress towards defined  technology goals’. (p. 7)

No indication of where the statements will be  published and no requirement for them to be tabled in  parliament.

The discussion paper identifies and discusses ‘key  technology challenges and opportunities’ and short-term (2020-2022), medium term (2023-2030) and long  term (2030-2050+) (pp. 29-31 and Figure 6).

Reporting The Commission prepares an

annual report which must  include details of greenhouse gas  emissions and removals,  emissions projections and an  assessment of the adequacy of  the emissions reduction plan  (section 70)

The Minister must prepare a  statement in response to the  annual report within three  months, which must be tabled in  Parliament (sections 71-72)

‘Low Emissions Technology Statements’ will be  published each year ‘to communicate progress  towards defined technology goals’. (p. 7).

First Technology Statement will be delivered to  Parliament in Q3 2030. No indication or requirement  for future Statements to be tabled in Parliament.

Does not mention emissions reporting.

7



Climate risk assessments The Commission prepares  national climate change risk  assessments every five years,  which are given to the Minister  and published on the  Commission website (sections  17-18)

Does not mention climate risks

Although does refer to commercial and technical risks  of technology investment portfolio (p. 36)

Adaptation Plans In response to each climate risk  assessment, the Minister must  prepare a national adaptation  plan. The Minister must consider  a number of matters and publicly  consult on the draft plan (section  19)

A final national adaptation plan  is tabled in Parliament and  published on the Commission’s  website (section 20)

The Commission must provide  the Minister with an annual  progress report on the  implementation of the  adaptation plan and its  effectiveness. The Minister must  prepare a statement in response,  which must be tabled in  Parliament and published on the  Commission’s website (section  21).

Does not mention climate adaptation.













Climate Act: Frequently Asked Questions … and their  Answers

Questions  Why do we need the Climate Act?  Climate change is real for Australia, with immediate and deepening risks to our natural environment,  economy and way of life. Last summer’s unprecedented bushfires are a mark of the worst of those  risks, and how they will affect some communities more than others. But there are also opportunities  to prosper, given our enormous natural, human and financial wealth.

This Act would ensure Australia has a clear and positive national response to the challenges of  climate change. That is what a large and growing majority of Australians call for, and what Australia  needs.

How will it work?  The proposed Climate Act will mandate:  1. A Net Zero target by 2050  2. National Adaptation Plans and National Risk Assessments

3. Technology Readiness Assessment and;  4. An independent advisory commission

What is framework legislation?  Framework legislation is tried and proven legislation that has worked in overseas jurisdictions like  the United Kingdom, France and Ireland. It has reduced emissions, helped those countries adapt to  climate impacts, and progressed emissions reduction taking the partisan politics out of the debate. It  works by setting a long-term pathway to net zero and helps guide decision-making to meet that  target. It does this by requiring interim targets or emissions budgets which set a cap on economy-wide emissions.

By setting statutory targets, rather than just policy-based targets, it signals a greater level of  commitment to emission reduction. Setting targets in legislation will also provide parliamentary  scrutiny.

Framework legislation secures long-term policy, planning and ensures climate change action with  changes of government. It does this by mandating the Government of the day develop and  implement plans to meet those budgets and adapt to warming. This ensures that plans are not  shelved and forgotten. All plans are made with overarching principles like intergenerational equity,  transparency, fiscal responsibility and the best available science to ensure these plans are fair,  equitable and consistent with best practice.







What will the Climate Act do?  The Climate Act will:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Shore up Australia’s commitment to long-term climate action and reset the policy debate in  Australia

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Make an immediate positive contribution to the world’s action on climate change and  bolster our standing internationally  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Put Australia on a course towards a long-term goal of net zero by 2050  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ensure action on climate change is equitable, transparent and leads to the best outcomes

for all Australians  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Help protect Australians by ensuring there are plans to assess risks to all sectors and  communities, adapt to climate impacts and;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Position Australia to take advantage of the economic opportunities that will come from

climate action



Why a Net Zero by 2050 target?  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Net Zero by 2050 is a science-based target consistent with the advice of climate science  academia and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change literature1  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It is consistent with targets set in other developed countries around the world2  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It would bring the Commonwealth into alignment with the Australian States and Territories

the majority of which have Net Zero targets in policy or legislation   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Built into the legislation are 5-yearly reviews which are consistent with the ‘pledge and  review periods’ of the Paris Agreement and;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The targets can be changed if there are significant developments in the science,

international agreements and/or technology

Who will introduce it into parliament?  Zali Steggall, the Independent MP for Warringah in NSW will introduce the Bill. The United Kingdom  Climate Change Act (2008) was also first introduced by a private member.

What’s the difference between a bill and an Act?  A bill is a formal document prepared in the form of a draft Act. A bill becomes an Act—a law—only  after it has been passed in identical form by both Houses of the Parliament and assented to by the  Governor-General.

Who will vote for it?  As a non-partisan Bill, all MPs should reflect their communities’ wishes and vote for the Climate Act  as they did for Marriage Equality - not hide behind party lines.















1  https://www.ipcc.ch/2018/10/08/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-on-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments/  2

https://eciu.net/netzerotracker





Objection Handling  Isn’t this just more government red tape and bureaucracy?   Australians expect the government to step up on climate change and this includes with laws. The Act  provides a proven law to guide the transition to a net zero emissions economy and adapt to climate  impacts already locked in.

Economically, it will position us to take advantage of the boom in low emissions technology, provide  the business sector with certainty that we are on the right track, as well as the option to pursue new  opportunities.



But there are no actual policies in here? Why don’t you put in a carbon tax or  emissions trading scheme?  Governments are elected on the priorities they bring to the electorate and this Act respects that.  The Climate Act’s key strength is its flexibility. It allows the government of the day to come up with  policies depending on their priorities. Importantly, there will be close oversight by an independent  advisory commission scrutinising whether those policies are working towards these goals or not.

Why now?  As a signatory to the Paris Agreement, Australia has committed to action that would limit warming  to a safe level, and that means getting to Net Zero by 2050. Australia is now behind many other  OECD countries, as well as Australian States and Territories in committing to Net Zero by 2050. Last  summer’s bushfires have shown there is no time to waste. With the Climate Act we can put in law  that target and plan a meaningful pathway to get there.

What about jobs and the economy?  During the time the United Kingdom Climate Change Act (2008) has been in place, the UK’s GDP has  grown by 67%, while emissions have fallen by 42%. There are now more than 390,000 jobs3 in low-carbon businesses and their supply chains, employing people across the UK. The UK’s low-carbon  and renewable-energy economy was worth Â£43bn in 2016.4  A recent study from Oxford University has shown that clean technology projects create 8 jobs for  every 1.6 million invested compared to 2.6 with old energy production like gas and coal.5

Natural disasters like bushfires, droughts and floods are showing that the cost of inaction far  outweighs the cost of action. The recent 2019-20 bushfires are projected to have cost the Australian  economy up to $100 billion dollars. Further, modelling has shown that if we miss our climate targets  -  keeping warming below 2 degrees and as close to 1.5 as possible - there will be cumulative  economic cost of $2.7 trillion by 2050 to the economy.6 The Climate Act aims to protect our  economy against these impacts to ensure our prosperity into the future.

Why do we need a Climate Act when the Government have already got a  Technology Investment Roadmap?  The goal of the Roadmap “is to bring a strategic and system-wide view to future investments in low  emissions technologies.” It establishes a consultative process and governance structure that will  assist in highlighting then developing the low emissions technologies that will be critical over the  next several decades.

Regrettably, the Roadmap alone is insufficient to provide for comprehensive climate action. Namely  the lack of emissions budgeting, a long-term target, adaptation plans and insufficient transparency  and accountability measures. However, when integrated with the Climate Act it is complementary.  The Roadmap will help assess low emissions technology readiness.

Myth Reality

“Will putting a plan in place for Net  Zero by 2050 limit economic growth?”  The CSIRO in their ‘outlook vision’ has estimated that limiting emissions to  net zero by 2050 amongst other factors could result in 2.75-2.8% GDP

growth annually.i As opposed to 2.1% under less ambitious scenarios.

The Climate Act will mandate that there are plans to get to net zero by 2050.

“Why are we aiming to get to Net Zero  by 2050 as Australia is only responsible  for 1.3% of global emissions?”

Australia is the world’s 18th largest emitter out of 210 countries. Added to  that, we are only 0.3% of the world’s population. ii We are already not pulling  our weight.

Moreover, 201 countries emit less than 2%. If we all took that attitude, we  would fail to limit warming to a safe level.

According to the Bureau of Meteorology, Australia is also warming faster  than the global averageiii and therefore especially vulnerable to climate  change. It is simply in our national interest to lead.

“Australia does not need the Act as the  Climate Change Authority is already  advising the government on targets  that put Australia on a path to net-zero  emissions”

The current Climate Change Authority only reviews the functioning of certain  legislation and is tasked to review policy and pathway to lower emissions  only by referral from the minister. This means it’s function are limited and  historically it has not been utilised effectively.

The new independent advisory commission will review policy and report  publicly on progress yearly without referral by the minister.

“Will having an Act limit the  government’s policy making ability?”  The Act does not limit policy making and leaves policy making in the hands of  our elected Government.



“Is this Act supported by the  constitution?”  This Act relies on the ‘external affairs’ power in s 51(xxix) of the constitution  which allow laws to enact obligations under international treaties.



The Climate Act will go to the heart of Australia’s obligations under the UN  Framework Convention on Climate Change, Paris Agreement and other  international agreements.

This is written explicitly at Paragraph 3 (1) (g) in the Objects of the Bill.

^3  Objects of this Act 4

(1) This Act recognises: 5   (a) that climate change is a serious challenge to Australia’s 6  prosperity and security and this requires a planned transition 7  towards a net zero emissions economy and the 8

implementation of adaptation measures to protect livelihoods, 9  business and the environment; and 10   (b) that decisions under this Act should be consistent with 11  limiting the increase in global warming to well below 2Â°C 12

and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial 13  levels. 14

(2) The objects of this Act are to establish a framework to address the 15  challenge of climate change, including by doing the following: 16   (a) setting a target of achieving net zero emissions by a target 17  day (which is 31 December 2050 unless the Minister 18

determines an earlier day because of a significant change in 19  relevant factors); 20   (b) providing for a system of emissions budgeting; 21   (c) assessing the risk of, and preparing for, climate change 22

impacts; 23   (d) building the resilience of the national economy to climate 24  change; 25   (e) establishing an independent body to ensure accountable and 26

transparent plans to manage the climate challenge; 27   (f) aligning government and the private sector in the assessment 28  of climate risks; 29   (g) providing policy certainty to assist the private sector in 30

decision making; 31   (h) assisting and guiding the taking of action by government and 32  the community to reduce emissions in order to meet 33  Australia’s obligations under the following: 34

change. 5

^4  Simplified outline of this Act 6

This Act establishes a framework for adaptation and mitigation in 7  relation to climate change. 8

Decision makers must consider 7 guiding principles when 9  performing functions or duties or exercising powers under this Act 10  or provisions of other prescribed Acts. 11

The Commission is required to prepare a national climate change 12  risk assessment within a year of the commencement of this Act and 13  every 5 years after that. 14

In response to each national climate change risk assessment, the 15  Minister must prepare a national adaptation plan. The Commission 16  must evaluate the implementation of these plans annually. 17

This Act sets a target of net zero emissions by a target day (which 18  is 31 December 2050). The target day can be changed by the 19  Minister if there is a significant change in factors relevant to the 20  target. 21

In order to meet the Target, this Act also provides for the Minister 22  to set emissions budgets on advice from the Commission. 23

The Minister must also prepare emissions reduction plans for each 24  emissions budget. The Commission provides advice on these plans 25  also. 26

This Act establishes the Commission and provides for a 27  Parliamentary Joint Committee on Climate Adaptation and 28
