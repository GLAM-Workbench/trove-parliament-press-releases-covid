REFORMS TO UNLOCK INVESTMENT ACROSS NORTHERN AUSTRALIA

Reforms to speed up investment approvals for the Northern Australia Infrastructure  Facility (NAIF) that will turbo-charge job and economic opportunities across the  north have been introduced into Federal Parliament this week.

Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia Keith Pitt said the reforms will  extend the operations of the Government’s $5 billion NAIF for a further five years  until 30 June 2026.

“Our changes will provide NAIF with more flexibility and new investment tools, as  well as widening the scope of projects eligible for funding and strengthen its  governance,” Minister Pitt said.

“The Coalition Government is determined to unlock further potential across northern  Australia and to ensure the north further increases its contribution to jobs growth  and economic activity.

“The changes will empower NAIF to make faster lending decisions for appropriate  projects, and increase NAIF’s risk appetite so it can respond more appropriately to  the economic challenges following the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The reforms will also strengthen NAIF’s governance, allow NAIF to make strategic  equity investments in some projects, and will expand the scope of projects which will  be able to apply for NAIF funding.”

The reforms outlined in the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Amendment   (Extension and Other Measures) Bill 2021 address the recommendations of a 2020

statutory review of NAIF which consulted widely on how NAIF could best contribute  to economic development in the north.

Assistant Minister for Northern Australia Michelle Landry said the Government had  listened to stakeholders and communities across northern Australia, who said that  while NAIF was an important investment vehicle, more could be done to improve its  processes.

“Communities in northern Australia made it clear they wanted NAIF to be more  nimble and agile, and ready to respond,” Assistant Minister Landry said.

“We are determined to streamline NAIF’s operations and sharpen its investment  focus, to make sure it can continue to support development opportunities across the  north for the good of all Australians.”

Detailed changes in the Bill include measures for:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ faster lending, by giving NAIF the option to lend directly to project proponents  in certain circumstances, simplifying the lending process and cutting the  administrative burden;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ expanding eligibility, to allow NAIF to invest in additional areas such as

equipment purchase or leasing, training, or the expansion of existing  operations;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ facilitating the NAIF’s use of equity investments, equipping the NAIF with a

diverse range of financial tools to assist projects; and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ strengthen governance, including the appointment of a government

representative to the NAIF board and including a board member with  experience in Indigenous development.

Since it started operations in 2016, NAIF has made investment commitments of over  $2.8 billion to 24 projects.
