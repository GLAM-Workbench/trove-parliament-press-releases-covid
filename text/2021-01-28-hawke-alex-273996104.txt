Parent visa applicants to remain onshore during COVID-19

The Morrison Government continues to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on visa  holders and is actively reviewing the settings for various visas in response to the challenges  posed by COVID-19 on an ongoing basis.

In November the Government announced visa changes to support applicants in five Family visa  subclasses impacted by COVID-19 travel restrictions.

Today Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon  Alex Hawke MP, said the Government intends make changes to allow further temporary  concessions for Parent visa applicants.

“The Government is pursuing changes to allow certain Parent visa applicants who have applied  for their visa outside Australia to be granted that visa while in Australia during the COVID-19  period,” Minister Hawke said.

“This temporary concession would apply to Parent visa subclasses and will allow eligible  applicants who are in Australia and unable to travel offshore due to COVID-19 impacts to be  granted that visa,” Minister Hawke said.

The changes would apply to:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Parent (subclass 103) visa

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Contributory Parent (subclass 173) visa

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Contributory Parent (subclass 143) visa.

The current processing arrangements and timeframes for Parent visa applications will not be  impacted.

These changes are to take effect in the first quarter of 2021. Those unable to depart should  refer to the Department of Home Affairs’ website for information about options for remaining  lawfully in Australia.

Information about the measures the Government has taken in response to the COVID-19  pandemic is regularly updated and available on the Department’s website at  https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/.
