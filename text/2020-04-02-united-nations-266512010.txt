PRESS RELEASE

United Nations Secretary-General launches plan to address the  potentially devastating socio-economic impacts of COVID-19

Establishes global fund to support low- and middle-income countries

NEW  YORK, 31  MARCH  2020—The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is attacking societies at their core,  claiming lives and people’s livelihoods. The potential longer-term effects on the global economy and those of  individual countries are dire.

In a new report, Shared responsibility, global solidarity: Responding to the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19,  the United Nations Secretary-General calls on everyone to act together to address this impact and lessen the  blow to people.

The report describes the speed and scale of the outbreak, the severity of cases, and the societal and economic  disruption of COVID-19, which has so far claimed the lives of 33 257 people, with 697 244 confirmed cases in  204 countries, areas and territories1.

“COVID-19  is  the  greatest  test  that  we  have  faced  together  since  the  formation  of  the  United  Nations,”  said   AntÃÂ³nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations. “This human crisis demands coordinated, decisive,  inclusive and innovative policy action from the world’s leading economies - and maximum financial and techni -cal support for the poorest and most vulnerable people and countries.”

The report comes after the IMF has announced that the world has entered into a recession as bad or worse than  in 2009. The report calls for a large-scale, coordinated and comprehensive multilateral response amounting to  at least 10 percent of global GDP.

The United Nations system—and its global network of regional, sub-regional and country offices working for  peace, human rights, sustainable development and humanitarian action, will support all governments and part-ners through the response and recovery.

To  that  end,  the  Secretary-General  has  established  a  dedicated  COVID-19  Response  and  Recovery  Fund  to    support  efforts  in  low-  and  middle-income  countries.  Its  approach  underpins  the  reformed  UN  with  a  coor-dinated  multi-agency,  multi-sectoral  response  for  priority  national  and  local  actions  to  address  the  socio-  economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis. It will count on the country leadership of Resident Coordinators and UN  Country Teams in swiftly supporting and enabling governments in this crisis, and recovery.

NOTES TO EDITORS

The shared responsibility and global solidarity roadmap calls for:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Suppressing the transmission of the virus to control the pandemic.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Safeguarding people’s lives and their livelihoods.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Learning from this human crisis to build back better.

Suppressing the transmission of the virus to control the pandemic

The report warns that there is no time to lose in mounting the most robust and cooperative health response the  world has ever seen. The strongest support must be provided to the multilateral effort to suppress transmission  and stop the pandemic, led by the World Health Organization.

At the same time there is great need for scientific collaboration in the search for a vaccine and effective thera -peutics. This must be matched with assurances of universal access to vaccines and treatment.

Throughout the report a people-centred approach is promoted that calls for engaging communities affected by  COVID-19, respect for human rights and inclusion, gender equality and dignity for all.

Safeguarding people’s lives and their livelihoods

Recognizing that epidemics can expose and exacerbate existing inequalities in society, the road map shows it  will be crucial to cushion the knock-on effects on people’s lives, their livelihoods and the economy.

The report highlights examples of actions countries could take, such as direct provision of resources to support  workers and households, provision of health and unemployment insurance, scaling-up of social protection, and  support to businesses to prevent bankruptcies and job loss.

The report strongly recognizes that women and girls must have a face in the response; and opportunities for  young people, seriously affected, need to be preserved.

Learn from this crisis to build back better

The world will be faced with a choice in its recovery. Go back to the world we knew before or deal decisively with  those issues that make everyone unnecessarily vulnerable to this and future crises.

From stronger health systems and fewer people living in extreme poverty to achieving gender equality and taking  climate action for a healthy planet, the report gives hope that lessons from this human crisis can build more just  and resilient societies and deliver on the promise of the 2030 Agenda and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

Partnerships for progress

No single country or entity will win alone against the pandemic. A successful response and recovery will require  international cooperation and partnerships at every level -- governments taking action in lock step with commu-nities; private sector engagement to find pathways out of this crisis. Partnerships based on solidarity will be the  cornerstone for progress.

Civil  Society,  women  and  grassroots  organizations,  community-based  organizations  and  faith-based  organi-zations will play a vital role. In assisting the most vulnerable populations, these networks are active in bringing  economic and livelihood opportunities and adapting responses to the community context. These organizations,  in many locations in the world, are the first, or only, point of reference for individuals and families as they seek to  cope with the impacts of  COVID-19 and for the recovery ahead.

Call to action

The COVID-19 Pandemic is a defining moment for modern society, and history will judge the efficacy of the  response not by the actions of any single set of government actors taken in isolation, but by the degree to which  the response is coordinated globally across all sectors for the benefit of our human family.

The United Nations and its global network of regional, sub-regional and country offices working for peace, human  rights, sustainable development and humanitarian action, supported by established coordination mechanisms,  will work with partners to ensure first and foremost that lives are saved, livelihoods are restored, and that the  global economy and the people we serve emerge stronger from this crisis.

The 129 UN Resident Coordinators and the UN Country Teams will provide comprehensive policy and operational  support at the national level in support of a whole of society approach in countries. With the right actions, the  COVID-19 pandemic can mark the beginning of a new type of global and societal cooperation.

Recommended measures to cope with the impacts of COVID-19:

1    Global measures to match the magnitude of the crisis

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Advocate and support implementation of a human-centered, innovative and coordinated stimulus package  reaching double-digit percentage points of the world’s gross domestic product.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Resist the temptation to resort to protectionist measures.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Take explicit measures to boost the economies of developing countries.

2    Regional mobilization

A coordinated regional approach will enable collective examination of impacts, coordination of monetary, fiscal  and social measures, and sharing best practices and the lessons learned.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Adopt DO NO HARM trade policies, preserve connectivity, and ensure regional monetary-fiscal coordination.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Engage with private financial sector to support businesses.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Address structural challenges and strengthen normative frameworks to deal with transboundary risks.

3    National solidarity is crucial to leave no one behind

The pandemic is hitting an already weak and fragile world economy. Global growth in 2019 was already the slow-est since the global financial crisis of 2008/2009. According to ILO estimates, the world could lose between 5  million and 25 million jobs.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Undertake fiscal stimulus and support for the most vulnerable.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Protect Human Rights and focus on inclusion.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Support to Small and Medium sized Enterprises.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Support decent work.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Support education.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Prioritize social cohesion measures.
