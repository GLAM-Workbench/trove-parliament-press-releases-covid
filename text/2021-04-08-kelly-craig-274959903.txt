Australian health officials must follow the evidence and act now !

Independent Member for Hughes, Craig Kelly has today again called on  Government health officials to follow the lead of Europe and immediately suspend  AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine for use in Australia, for all under 65-year-olds - at the  very minimum.

Craig Kelly said:  “Overnight Spain and Italy (for under 60’s) and Belgium (for under 56’s) have  suspended AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine following the latest data released by the  European Medicines Agency (EMA) on the risk of potential serious harms from the  vaccine for different age groups.

“Spain, Italy and Belgium have now joined Canada, France, Germany, Holland,  Denmark, Luxemburg, Norway, Sweden, Latvia and Iceland that already have their  own various suspensions in place.

“Further, even on AstraZeneca’s home turf of the UK, health regulators moved  swiftly yesterday to suspend AstraZeneca’s Covid Vaccine for under 30-year-olds, it  is inconceivable that the Australian Government health officials would ignore the  advice from Europe, and sit on their hands as more Australians are jabbed.

“Just because the Australian government may have put most of their eggs in the  AstraZeneca basket, this is no reason to continue jabbing Australians with this  vaccine when so many health regulators in Europe have suspended on safety  concerns.

“The data released overnight by the EMA on the Potential serious harms v.  Potential benefits for various age groups, together with Australia’s low rate of  Covid infections, clearly demonstrates that for Australia the potential risk of  serious harm far OUTWEIGHS the potential benefits.

Australian health officials must follow the evidence and act now !  ENDS.
