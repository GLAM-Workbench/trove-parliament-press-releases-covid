INTERVIEW WITH BEN FORDHAM

2GB BREAKFAST  9 FEBRUARY 2021



Subjects: Speculation about proposals for a Chinese-built city in Papua New Guinea; Cheng Lei; Sean  Turnell’s detention in Myanmar;

Ben Fordham:

The Foreign Minister Marise Payne, boy, she’s got a lot on her plate. She always does. There’s an  Australian journalist detained in China who’s now been formally arrested. Cheng Lei is accused of  espionage and sharing Chinese state secrets. And we’ve also got concerns about a Chinese company  wanting to build an entire city in Papua New Guinea, just 200 kilometres from Australia. Man in  Myanmar, an Australian academic has been detained in the wake of the military coup. Sean Turnell has  been working as an advisor to the government, he’s now locked up in a cell.

Marise Payne is our Foreign Minister and she’s live on the line. Minister, good morning to you.

Marise Payne:

Good morning, Ben and Happy New Year.

Ben Fordham:

Happy New Year. Boy, you’ve got a busy brief. I might actually start off with you about what’s going on  in PNG. This Chinese company wanting to build an entire city just 200 kilometres from the Australian  mainland. Have we got anything to be concerned about?

Marise Payne:

Well Ben, we’re working very closely with our counterparts in Papua New Guinea on these issues, as you  would expect. We have a number of interests, particularly in relation to the Torres Strait and the Torres  Strait Treaty. So in both of those cases, we’re raising the full range of our Australian interests, that

includes fisheries obviously, environmental issues, the livelihoods of traditional inhabitants. And we're  long-term supporters of Western Province, which is where Daru is located.

In fact, I met on these issues of supporting Western Province with Warren Entsch, the very lively  Member for Leichhardt, just last week in Parliament. So, working closely with the provincial and the  national government to support sustainable development that really benefits the people of the area -  their livelihoods, food and water security, absolutely vital, and both health and community resilience as  well.

Ben Fordham:

When it comes to Chinese companies moving in and moving up, there's also a case in the Whitsundays,  Keswick Island, where the Queensland Government approved a 99-year lease to a Chinese company.  And then when the Chinese developer, China Bloom, moved in, they closed down the airstrip, they shut  the boat ramp, they locked the gate to the national park and now there’s keep out signs all over the  place. Is there anything that can be done about that?

Marise Payne:

I'm not familiar with that specific case, Ben. But what we have been consistently saying, particularly in  relation to investment in the region and where it forms development assistance, that it should be  focussed on contributing to security, to stability, to prosperity. And in domestic communities here, I  would say that it’s very important for domestic communities to be able to ensure that businesses that  invest in their area are compliant with their own requirements and provide the sorts of access that they  would expect from any investor.

Ben Fordham:

You had some success last year in helping the release of Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert in Iran and now we've  got a number of Australians detained overseas. The case in China of Cheng Lei has stepped up a bit with  a formal arrest. And then we've got Sean Turnell, who was working as an economic adviser to the  government in Myanmar, also now detained. I'm guessing that you're negotiating on those fronts.

Marise Payne:

Yes, of course we are, particularly in relation to both cases. Professor Sean Turnell is a very highly  regarded academic and has really given many years of his professional life to supporting the  development and the progress of Myanmar, and a particular commitment to the democratic transition  that had been underway there. So, we are providing as much consular assistance as we can to him and  to other Australians, but we are definitely calling for his immediate release. So, advocating both at the  highest levels in Yangon and in Naypyidaw and calling in the Myanmar Ambassador here in Canberra to  do that. It is very important to us. We don't believe that he should continue to be detained. And it is my  absolute focus.

A very different matter is that of Ms Cheng Lei, a journalist, Australian journalist who was detained in  China. She has been in detention since August of last year, but was formally arrested under the Chinese  system on Friday last week. We've been working very hard to ensure our consular access to her has  continued in recent months and have raised concerns in relation to her conditions of detention. We  visited her most recently on 27th January this year, and that is in accordance with our bilateral consular  agreement with China. But we do have basic expectations and they are that standards of justice,

procedural fairness and humane treatment should be met in accordance with international norms. And  we will advocate for that for an Australian citizen in her circumstances, of course.

Ben Fordham:

Just two quick ones before I need to run. The second impeachment trial of Donald Trump begins  tomorrow, and the new Biden administration is down to work. Are you off to Washington any time  soon?

Marise Payne:

Ben, we've been engaged with our counterparts. I've spoken with Secretary of State Antony Blinken,  with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. As you know, COVID has seriously constrained our ability to  move around and make visits. But I'm looking forward to doing that as soon as it's practically possible in  the context of COVID-19 restrictions. And new counterparts in the United States are new but not new in  some ways. They're well known to us, they’re people we've worked with before and we're looking  forward to a strong and positive relationship. This year sees the 70th anniversary of the ANZUS Treaty.  And I know for the Prime Minister and for President Biden, that's going to be a very important  anniversary to mark.

Ben Fordham:

Marise Payne, it's well known around Canberra that you've got the best horse racing tips in the Federal  Parliament. Would you commit in 2021 to sharing any good leads with the 2GB audience?

Marise Payne:

I'll talk to my horse whisperer, Ben, and come back to you about that one and see what I can share.

Ben Fordham:

Typical politician, dodging the question. Thank you very much for your time.

Marise Payne:

Thanks Ben.

Ben Fordham:

Marise Payne, the Foreign Minister joining us.
