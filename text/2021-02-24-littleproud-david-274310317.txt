Almost $29 million local economic injection for   SA’s bushfire-affected communities

The Australian and South Australian Governments today announced almost $29 million in  funding for 12 new projects to boost local economies across South Australia’s bushfire-affected communities.

Local Economic Recovery (LER) support under the National Bushfire Recovery Fund,  announced last May by the Australian Government, is assisting communities to lead  recovery in their area. It is supported by additional co-funding contributions from states.

Federal Minister for Emergency Management David Littleproud said the mix of programs  delivered under the National Bushfire Recovery Fund aims to meet the short-term needs  of individuals and businesses, while at the same time building sustainable and resilient  communities for the longer term.

“These projects focus on bringing employment and economic benefits to these  communities that have been so hard hit by the 2019-20 bushfires, and now COVID-19,”  Minister Littleproud said.

“Regionally-driven economic projects create jobs, attract visitors and help our regional  South Australian towns thrive into the future - a great step forward in bushfire recovery.”

South Australian Premier Steven Marshall said funding for these 12 new projects was in  addition to the $19.8 million committed to Kangaroo Island’s new desalination plant, and  the $150,000 in funding to help restore the Lobethal Bushland Park.

“Following consultation with local councils, recovery committees, communities and other  stakeholders in bushfire-affected areas across the state, we’ve selected a further dozen  projects that will bring employment and other benefits to impacted regions,” Premier  Marshall said.

“These projects will support jobs creation, attract visitors and help key local industries in  those areas hardest hit by last summer’s devastating bushfires.”
