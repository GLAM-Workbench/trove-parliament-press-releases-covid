FAST-TRACKING TRAINING AND SKILLS DURING COVID-19

A new sub-committee of the Australian Industry and Skills Committee (AISC), will drive  rapid and flexible development of training packages during the COVID-19 crisis.

Skills Ministers from all States and Territories agreed to priority national action to preserve  the core capability in Australia’s vocational education and training (VET) system and ensure  its continued capacity to deliver critical skills, at a meeting of the COAG Skills Council  today.

The Chair of the AISC, Emeritus Professor Tracey Horton AO, will immediately establish the  priority COVID-19 sub-committee to enable fast-tracked adjustments to qualifications and  training package requirements.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said existing training package processes must be fast-tracked to rapidly upskill in  essential services during this crisis.

“Of paramount importance is delivering high-quality and responsive training for critical  COVID-19 related skills, including aged care and healthcare,” Minister Cash said.

“I welcome the agreement today by State and Territory Ministers to take immediate steps to  benefit students and training providers to ensure we have a skilled workforce fit to meet the  challenges facing essential industries during this difficult period and beyond.”

Assistant Minister for Vocational Education, Training and Apprenticeships, the Hon Steve  Irons MP, welcomed the decision noting the national training system is already experiencing  disruption from COVID-19.

“We must ensure as much of the VET sector as possible can work through this period so we  are well positioned for recovery,” Minister Irons said.

Federal, State and Territory Skills Ministers agreed that protecting students and preserving  the capacity of Australia’s training system is a priority.
