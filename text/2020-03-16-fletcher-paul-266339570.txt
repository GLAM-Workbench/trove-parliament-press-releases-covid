Telco industry roundtable on COVID-19

The Morrison Government today convened a virtual roundtable with representatives from  Australia’s major telecommunications companies to discuss COVID-19 preparations, planning  and continuity measures in place to support telecommunications services.

Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher MP, spoke  with representatives from all major network operators at the roundtable, including senior  executives of NBN Co, Optus, Telstra, Vodafone, TPG and Vocus.

“Our telcos are quickly responding to the evolving challenges of COVID-19 and have in place  business continuity plans to continue to deliver vital telecommunications services,” Minister  Fletcher said.

Minister Fletcher was pleased by the very strong positive response received from industry  participants to his request that the telecommunications sector work collaboratively to support  Australians in changing patterns of working and living over this next period to minimise the  public health risk posed by the COVID-19 virus.

The Minister commended the industry for their work on business continuity and supporting  their staff and customers. The roundtable agreed to establish a special working group  comprised of the major telcos, and led by NBN Co, to share relevant information and discuss  emerging engineering, security or operational issues in relation to COVID-19.

The roundtable also agreed there is a requirement for protocols to guide interactions that  technicians have with customers who are self-isolating, including guidance on personal  protective equipment. The Government will engage with the telecommunications sector to  provide clarity.

Major companies across the telecommunications sector are planning for changes in data usage  and traffic resulting from people working or studying from home. NBN Co is optimising its  network with expectations that day-time network traffic will rise significantly - drawing on  international experience, for example in Italy, which has reported a 26 per cent increase in fixed

line peak hour network traffic as more people work from home. NBN Co has experience in  managing periods of exceptionally high traffic, particularly during school holidays.

“NBN Co and other industry participants are expecting a change in traffic patterns, with higher  traffic levels during the day and increased activity in the suburbs as compared to business  districts. All of these factors are being taken into consideration with retail service providers in  provisioning the network,” Minister Fletcher said.

“The National Broadband Network rollout is 94 per cent complete, and from this week is  expected to surpass 11 million homes and businesses able to connect, providing Australians  across the country with high speed, reliable broadband.

“Today’s roundtable revealed thorough preparation across the telecommunications industry.  The Government will continue to engage closely with the telecommunications sector as  circumstances evolve.”

Background:

Tips for working from home:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Talk to your retail service provider about how your broadband needs may change,  including a greater reliance on upload speeds, and what the appropriate plan is to meet  those needs.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Make sure your workspace has good Wi-Fi connectivity. Do an online speed test in your  work area and then another test next to your modem or with your laptop connected  directly to your modem. A significant difference in speeds may mean your workspace is  not getting a good Wi-Fi signal. If you are concerned about your Wi-Fi coverage or the  performance of your modem, seek advice from your internet retailer on possible  upgrade options.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If you experience trouble connecting to your office from home, try navigating to a third-party site like Google. If you can do this, the problem may be with your company’s  systems, not your internet connection. Contact your company’s IT services for  assistance.

NBN continuity preparations:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ NBN Co is seeing the aggregate network traffic following normal patterns, but showing  a modest increase of around 6 per cent throughout the day and at peak times.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The most useful data sources are NBN Co’s counterparts in countries where more  people are working from home. Telecom Italia has been sharing data with NBN Co on

what they are observing during the busy hour traffic period, which is an approximate 26  per cent increase.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ As the situation develops, NBN Co also expects busy hour traffic to increase  significantly and potentially up to 40 per cent, in-line with the experience of other  countries.
