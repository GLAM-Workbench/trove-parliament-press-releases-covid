MENTAL HEALTH PACKAGE WELCOMED BUT FURTHER ACTION

NEEDED



Labor welcomes the Government’s announcement of a package to address

mental health needs of Australians during the COVID-19 health emergency.



A mental health response is urgent. The Government must act now.



Last week Labor formally requested the Government develop a comprehensive

mental health response including expanded support for mental health telehealth

services, support for those affected by COVID-19, and dedicated support

services.



In particular Labor welcomes the following measures from today’s

announcement:



Ã¢ÂÂ¢           Mental health telehealth service expansion

Ã¢ÂÂ¢           Specific COVID-19 portal on the Government’s headtohealth.gov.au

website

Ã¢ÂÂ¢           National mental health campaign during the COVID-19 health

emergency

Ã¢ÂÂ¢           Dedicated COVID-19 wellbeing support line, including for financial

stresses

Ã¢ÂÂ¢           Additional funding for mental health support providers who are

experiencing unprecedented demands

Ã¢ÂÂ¢           Specific services for health professionals, older and vulnerable

Australians, youth, and Indigenous Australians.



We welcome these measures, and request further details on these measures,

particularly around support for those on the frontline, and those vulnerable

populations.



We are also pleased the Government has taken up Labor’s call for an

expansion of the Community Visitors Scheme for older Australians. There is

more to be done - but this is an important recognition we must look after older

Australians who are already at risk of loneliness and social isolation.



These are all things that Labor has consistently advocated for.



Labor urges the Government to roll out these measures immediately. At the

same time information on where and how to access these services must be

clearly communicated to those who may need them.



As well as these measures, Labor has requested the Government provide

additional resources for:



Ã¢ÂÂ¢           Mental health screening for those tested for COVID-19

Ã¢ÂÂ¢           The mental health website for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis to

include a self-help clinic aimed at early intervention and reducing pressure on

the health system across Australia

Ã¢ÂÂ¢           Guarantee within the funds allocated, to ensure a mental health text

service is available 24 hours a day.



Now is also the time for the Government to consult broadly and widely to

ensure the best possible mental health response is incorporated in every

measure taken in this emergency.



This is an unprecedented health emergency. It requires an unprecedented

response.



The health and economic impact of this emergency, everything from job losses

to physical isolation and illness, will have a significant flow on to our mental

health and well being.



Mental health needs to be considered in every single measure that the

Government announces during this emergency. We should physically distance

and socially connect.



The Government has a responsibility to ensure every Australian has access to

affordable mental health services.



Labor stands ready to work with the Government to look after every Australian’s

mental health.
