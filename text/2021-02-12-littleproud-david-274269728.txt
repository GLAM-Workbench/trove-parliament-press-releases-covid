Food regulators abandon fruit and vegetable growers

Ã¯ÂÂ· Minister lashes decision to retain low health star ratings for pure fruit,  vegetable juice

Agriculture Minister David Littleproud says a decision by food regulators to give 100 per  cent pure Aussie fruit and vegetable juice a lower health star rating than diet cola is just  madness.

“The Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation failed the  leadership test today by retaining a non-sensical health star rating system,” Minister  Littleproud said.

“States and territories who supported this including Queensland, Northern Territory, ACT  and Victoria have let down our farmers, consumers, and Australia’s $800 million juice  industry.

“This will mean 100 per cent pure orange juice will have a health star rating lower than that  of a diet soft drink.

“They have made a mockery of the rating system and have ignored  Australian Government and industry concerns. It would appear as though the states that  voted for this are beholden to their bureaucrats.

“How can anyone believe that the health star rating for drinks with no nutritional value  should be higher than 100 per cent fruit and vegetable juices?

“This is madness and disrespects our country’s vegetable and citrus growers and their  communities.

“Reducing health star ratings for fruit and vegetable juices will impact demand for these  products and flow-on to the bottom line for many farmers.

“This decision is a blow to citrus growing regions like Queensland’s Central Burnett,  Victoria’s Murray Valley, New South Wales’ Riverina, and South Australia’s Riverland.

“Supporting our agricultural industries is incredibly important in the current difficult climate  of COVID-19, drought and bushfires.

“I will continue working with my colleagues and industry on ways to restore common sense  in the health star rating system.”

Fast Facts:

Ã¯ÂÂ· The Australian Department of Health’s proposal to amend the Health Star  Calculator by adding two modifying points to the fruit, vegetable, nut and  legume score was not supported by the Forum at today’s meeting.

Ã¯ÂÂ· People already do not eat enough fruit and the Australian Dietary Guidelines,  for consumption of non-dairy beverages, recommend that a glass of juice  (125ml) can be consumed as a substitute to a serve of whole fruit.
