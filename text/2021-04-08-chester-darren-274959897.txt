COMMEMORATING ANZAC DAY 2021

FOR what they have done this we will do — the simple reason all Australians must ensure the legacy  of commemoration continues this Anzac Day.

Minister for Veterans’ Affairs Darren Chester said Anzac Day was the most sacred day of  commemoration on the Australian calendar and a time for reflection to remember the service and  sacrifice of all Australian service personnel who have served the nation for over a century.

“As Australians we grow up learning about the Anzac tradition and recognise those who have served  and provided us with the freedoms we enjoy today,” Mr Chester said.

“Last year, in the face of a global pandemic we found new ways to honour those who serve and have  served — driveway vigils at dawn, private floral tributes, and contacting current and former defence  personnel to check in and thank them for their service.

“As we successfully navigate our way out of the global pandemic I am encouraging all Australians to  attend a local service and show their respect for those who have served, subject to local health  advice.

“At its heart, Anzac Day is a time for personal reflection, and attending a dawn service or march is  just one way we can show our respect, but there are a number of ways Australians can  commemorate in the lead-up to, and on, Anzac Day.

“However Australians choose to commemorate the day, it’s important that we all ensure our  veterans, current Australian Defence Force members, their families and the thousands of  descendants of our veterans know that we value the contribution of those who have served our  country.”

While the coronavirus pandemic still affects how we do things, there are ways Australians can mark  Anzac Day, including:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Attending a local community dawn or commemorative service (pending the latest health advice).

Ã¯ÂÂ· Tuning in to the ABC to Watch the Dawn Service and National Ceremony live from the Australian  War Memorial.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Leaving a poppy and personalised Anzac Day message on the Virtual Poppy Wall at  https://lestweforget.gov.au alongside thousands of other Australians.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Taking part in the RSL’s ‘Light up the Dawn’ campaign, which may include standing at the end of  your driveway at dawn.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Exploring the Australian War Memorial’s Anzac At Home content online for videos, activities and  recipes at www.awm.gov.au/anzacathome

Ã¯ÂÂ· Taking a photo of the local war memorial or honour board and upload it to Places of Pride at  www.placesofpride.awm.gov.au to help build the national register of Australian war memorials.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Taking part in their own private commemorations in a respectful, solemn and dignified way.

The Department of Veterans’ Affairs has also released a digital ‘kitbag’, which has a range of  practical resources to help people mark Anzac Day — from families, local community groups right  through to someone wanting to hold their own private commemoration.

“The kitbag includes posters, sample speeches, orders of service, supporting music, crafts cards on  how to make Anzac biscuits, poppies or a wreath and a range of supporting social media assets,  including social media banner images,” Mr Chester said.

“Everything is free, all in one spot and downloadable, making it simple for all Australians to access  and use.

“With many options available to commemorate this Anzac Day, as a nation we can all proudly carry  on the legacy of acknowledging service and sacrifice on Anzac Day in 2021.”
