A parliamentary inquiry into the impact of COVID-19 on Australia’s defence, trade and international relations will hear from the Department of Finance.

Senator David Fawcett, Chair of the Parliament’s Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, said that Australia’s government procurement policies—overseen by the Department—could be a barrier to the survival of capability in some industry sectors that have invested heavily to help carry the nation through the worst of supply chain disruption brought about by the pandemic. Generating and sustaining industry capabilities that are important to Australia’s sovereign national interest must be recognised as a factor in evaluating value for money if Government procurement is to be a strategic part of Australia’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic

Senator Fawcett said “In addition to the human cost of the pandemic, Australia has experienced supply chain disruptions and economic instability. Smart government procurement which contributes to the development of sovereign capability and builds economic resilience could be an important part of Australia’s recovery from the pandemic.”

Full terms of reference for the inquiry are on the Committee website.
