PROGRESS FOR THE CARRICK HILL PAVILION

Delivery of the highly anticipated visitors centre and pavilion at Carrick Hill is on track  with local architectural firm, Ashley Halliday Architects, finalising the concept plan for the  new visitor pavilion.

South Australian Premier Steven Marshall said projects like this have never been more  important as we recover from COVID, particularly in our local tourism industry.

“Housing a visitor centre, restaurant, cafÃÂ©, function centre and gift shop, the pavilion will  be the entry point into the grounds for visitors including those bushwalkers headed to the  Wirraparinga Loop Trail and other walks in our scenic state,” Premier Marshall said.

“These projects are creating local jobs and making Adelaide an even better place to live,  visit, study, work and do business.”

Federal Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure Alan Tudge said the  project was a perfect example city deal projects creating targeted, local opportunities.

“This project will create long term, local employment opportunities while also attracting  local, interstate and international visitors to the stunning Carrick Hill house and gardens,”  Mr Tudge said.

“This project will support local jobs and contracts for local businesses which is at the  helm of all city deal projects.”

Federal Member for Boothby Nicolle Flint said the investment into the Carrick Hill pavilion  would boost the local economy.

“Construction of the $5.5 million pavilion will commence next year with completion  expected in the second half of 2022,” Ms Flint said.







“With the beautiful backdrop of Carrick Hill’s House and Gardens, the pavilion will take in  magnificent views of Adelaide from the city to the coast.

“Alongside the recent renovations to Carrick House and the opening of the Wall Gallery  exhibition space, the new pavilion will reaffirm Carrick Hill as a premiere arts, cultural and  tourist destination.”

Carrick Hill Director Tony Kanellos is excited to see the pavilion completed.

“This investment will help Carrick Hill deliver an ambitious program and attract more  visitors. And of course, right now, local tourism is a perfect opportunity for South  Australians to explore our history, art and culture.”

The new visitor centre is part of the Adelaide City Deal with the Australian Government  committing $3 million to the project, the South Australian Government committing  $500,000 and up to $2 million from the Carrick Hill Development Foundation.

The Adelaide City Deal is a 10-year agreement between the Australian and South  Australian Governments and the City of Adelaide.
