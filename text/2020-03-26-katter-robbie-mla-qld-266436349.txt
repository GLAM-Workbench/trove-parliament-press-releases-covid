ADDRESS FIFO RISKS OR SHUT IT DOWN: KATTER   The mining industry is at risk of permanently destroying its social licence to operate if FIFO  continues to take place unchecked, KAP Leader and Traeger MP Robbie Katter has said.

Mr Katter said Queensland mining communities were understandably furious that FIFO had been  allowed to continue throughout the escalating COVID-19 crisis, and secondly about the perceived  lack of government and industry efforts to safeguard the towns put at risk in the process.

He said while mining was considered by government an essential industry that must be able to  continue, its modern-day reliance on FIFO and DIDO workers was exposing otherwise isolated  communities to huge risks that could result in catastrophe.

“Whilst I would prefer a total ban on FIFO, at the very least the government should be enforcing  strict protocols that provide these communities with some sense of surety that the mining  companies are acting responsibility whilst they are still being able to operate,” Mr Katter said.

“It is deeply concerning that my office is getting anecdotal reports coming in daily of mine workers  flying into site and working with locals, after coming in from all over the country.

“Of course some mining companies are making some effort to limit the risks, but presumably there  is a large variance in quality control between different mine sites.

“There is a growing anger amongst local residents, such as in Mount Isa, against this practice still  being tolerated at all; at the very least, these people need to be assured that there are some strict  standards being followed by the mining industry.

“I have voiced my concerns on this issue directly with the Premier and Minister Anthony Lynham’s  office.

“But in the absence of action of government on this we need to the mining companies to stand up  and act responsibly on behalf of their workers, and the local communities.”

Mr Katter said at the very least, mines with FIFO workforces must:



Ã¯ÂÂ§ Thoroughly assess new arrivals to site, including fever testing and in-depth medical and  travel questioning.   Ã¯ÂÂ§ Make available quarantine facilities for mild to moderately un-well (COVID-19 or otherwise)  patients, or those directed to go into self-quarantine for any reason - this is so not to

impose on the limited healthcare facilities available in the region.   Ã¯ÂÂ§ Ensure all FIFO or DIDO crews are travelling to and from site via the same mode of  transport at the same time, so to limit exposure risks to the outside community and to

further enhance screening abilities.
