CSIRO ANNOUNCEMENT CONTRASTS GOVERNMENT’S ANTI-SCIENCE

ACTIONS



Labor welcomes today’s CSIRO announcement outlining a program of missions to support the  nations future, particularly as we recovery from COVID-19 and the first recession in three years.

In his National Press Club speech today, CSIRO Chief Executive, Larry Marshall emphasised the  importance of listening to science and experts as we take on a number of challenges on the road to  recovery and resilience.

The speech also raised a number of challenges faced by scientists under the  Morrison Government,  including a decline in research and development and a failure to adequately commercialise science  within our own nation.

Unfortunately scientists and evidence are not sufficiently valued by some sections of the Morrison  Government, posing a grave danger for Australia’s future.

Let me be very clear, undermining science has taken various forms under Liberals, including cutting  staff at the CSIRO, the very organisation now testing vaccines for the coronavirus, and sending them  to the Centrelink queues.

This government has been silent when it comes to increasing concerns from scientists and  professional researchers that they are facing job cuts, insecure work, and wage freezes.

They have refused to give universities any support during this crisis, despite up to 30,000 jobs  estimated to be slashed. They resort to marketing the importance of STEM students and workers,  however their changes to universities will make it harder and more expensive to study.

Despite the obvious importance of research and development in the race to establish, manufacture  and distribute a vaccine, this Government remains committed to slashing nearly $2billion from the  R&D Tax Incentive, hurting Australian researchers and manufacturers in the private sector.

Federal Labor believes in the importance of listening to and respecting our experts, particularly in  response to COVID-19. The Government’s anti-science agenda is clear.

Cuts to the CSIRO, and research and development more broadly, will hamper Australia’s long-term  economic recovery from COVID-19.
