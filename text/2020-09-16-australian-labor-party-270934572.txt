HOSPITAL WAITS HAVE NEVER BEEN LONGER



New data confirms what Australians already know - that hospital waiting times

have never been longer than under Scott Morrison.



The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has today released Australia’s

hospitals at a glance 2018-19, including new data on public hospital waiting

times.



These official Government figures show that almost one in three emergency

department patients are not seen on time.



Some patients face even longer waits, with 40 per cent of urgent patients in

major cities not seen on time.



Elective surgery waiting times are also at record highs, with Australians waiting

a median seven months for a knee replacement, and nine months for a nose

surgery that’s needed to improve breathing.



This data is for 2018-19, and is set to worsen further when the impact of COVID

on elective surgery is taken into account.





Australia’s doctors, nurses and hospital staff work heroically to care for their

patients, including during COVID-19.



But their efforts have been undermined by a Government that has cut the

Commonwealth’s share of public hospital funding, and scrapped an agreement

designed specifically to reduce waiting times.



With Labor’s support and suggestions, the Government has treated COVID-19

with the urgency it deserves.



It must now do the same with public hospital waiting times - or Australians will

continue to suffer.
