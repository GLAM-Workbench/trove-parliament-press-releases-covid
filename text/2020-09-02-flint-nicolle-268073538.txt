New Carrick Hill Visitors Centre Creating Local Jobs

Local businesses and local jobs are at the centre of two new contracts awarded for the  delivery of the new Carrick Hill visitor centre pavilion.

Adelaide firm Ashley Halliday Architects have been engaged for architectural work, while  Rider Levett Bucknall will provide cost management services resourced entirely by local  staff.

Construction of the $5.5 million project will kick off next year.

The project is funded under the Adelaide City Deal, a 10-year, agreement between the  Australian and South Australian governments and the City of Adelaide.

Federal Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure Alan Tudge said it was  critical that local jobs and contracts for local businesses were at the helm of city deal  projects.

“This is a futher terrific investment to put money into the local economy and create jobs,”  Mr Tudge said.

“On top of that this project will drive the local tourism sector into the future.”

Federal Member for Boothby Nicolle Flint said Carrick Hill’s historic house at Springfield  is home to significant international and Australian art collections, with extensive gardens,  making it popular for locals and tourists alike.

“Formerly the home of Sir Edward and Lady Ursula Hayward, Carrick Hill is such an  important part of South Australia’s rich heritage,” Ms Flint said.

“With the pavilion set to be completed by mid-2022, Carrick Hill will become even more  of an attraction for locals and tourists.”

“Through the Adelaide City Deal, South Australia will now have Australia’s best art  gallery offering with the new Aboriginal Art and Cultures Centre, the Heysens at  Hahndorf , as well as Carrick Hill.

“These projects have never been more important as we look to the post-COVID  recovery, particularly for our local tourism industry.”

The Morrison Government is investing $3 million to build the new visitor centre pavilion  with $500,000 from the South Australian Government and up to $2 million from the  Carrick Hill Development Foundation.

It will also deliver a multipurpose visitor centre consolidating the cafÃÂ©, catering services,  information centre and gift shop.

Carrick Hill Director Tony Kanellos said the new pavilion will be a valuable addition that  will help more people discover the attraction.

“Carrick Hill was a bequest to the people of South Australia. We want more people to  know about the Haywards, their history, their collections, their garden and to make the  most of this generous gift,” Mr Kanellos said.

“The new pavilion will help Carrick Hill deliver an ambitious program and attract more  visitors. And of course, right now, local tourism is a perfect opportunity for us to explore  our history, art and culture.”
