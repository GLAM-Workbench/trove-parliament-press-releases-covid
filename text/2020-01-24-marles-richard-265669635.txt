SUBJECTS: Coronavirus; Speculation of Government reshuffle; Sports Rorts; Greg

KARL STEFANOVIC: Joining us now, is Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton and Deputy

Opposition Leader Richard Marles. Good to see you, nice to see you both. Let’s start with

you Pete, if we can. China has sealed off an entire city, a couple of cities in fact.

Something like 18 million people who have been quarantined. It is a huge task. We had a

plane loads come in from the district affected in China yesterday, into Sydney. Some of

them- all they had to do was fill out a questioner and it is a 14-day incubation for this

disease. Is this enough? Are we prepared for this?



PETER DUTTON, MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS: Well, Karl, there is obviously through

the World Health Organisation and through the Chief Medical Officer here,

established protocols. In the past concern coming out of Africa with the Ebola virus, for

example. The way in which we respond has developed over a period of time. We have the

world's best protocols in place. I think people should recognise that in a country like ours

the health services are the best prepared, best able to respond. As you point out; they can

quarantine people very quickly. It is hard if people are coming through different airports or

if they have been to that location or that province in the last month or so.



STEFANOVIC: You can’t stop it.



DUTTON: You can try and deal with it as best you can but you have got 570 odd peoples

who have been diagnosed already. I think 16 are dead. And those numbers I think will

escalate. The WHO, I think, is meeting overnight and they will decide then whether or

not they take it to the next level and we rely on that advice as well.



STEFANOVIC: Okay.



ALLISON LANGDON: Let's move on. Because it has been reported this morning the

Prime Minister is planning a major Cabinet reshuffle. Is the fate of Bridget McKenzie

sealed? She has to go, right? And, is a reshuffle actually on the cards.



DUTTON: Well no. And honestly, you read some of the speculation and people have

active social media accounts and I think that feel a need to fill them with speculation

around reshuffles and the rest. So, I think when you look at the process that Prime Minister

has put in place now for Bridget McKenzie the Secretary for Prime Minister and Cabinet

is looking at all the detail. He is going to report back, as I understand it, over the weekend

or early next week and I think that is the proper process.



RICHARD MARLES, DEPUTY LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY: So,

everyone is going to stay exactly where they are?



DUTTON: Richard, interestingly enough-



MARLES: Is that what is going to happen?



DUTTON: Richard, you got three sporting grants in your electorate, as did I. You got

$140,000 more than I did in my electorate.



STEFANOVIC: Indeed, it is a fair question.



MARLES: Most of the Sport Australia recommendations were ignored.



STEFANOVIC: But Peter, it is a fair question, is it going to be status quo? Is she going to

be removed? Is she going to resign herself?



DUTTON: No, no she is not, Karl.



STEFANOVIC: She is going to stay where she is?



DUTTON: I think if you strip away the emotion from this debate and look at the facts which

is what we should do. I don't think that a case has been made for Bridget McKenzie’s

removal.



STEFANOVIC: You don’t think she has done anything wrong?



DUTTON: Ministers are elected- appointed to make decisions and we all make decisions

in our portfolios. That is exactly what she has done. There was no funding provided to a

project that wasn't recommended.



STEFANOVIC: So the report was wrong, there was no pork barrelling?



DUTTON: The membership for the gun club didn't even come until after the grant had

been made. So the thought that she was a member of this club and somehow her

club benefitted is a complete nonsense.



STEFANOVIC: No one for a second believes that Bridget stood in front of a whiteboard,

a magical whiteboard and went I'm going to put this there and this there and she acted

alone. That is a furphy.



DUTTON: Well, Corio ended up with $140,000 more than my electorate, so I don’t know if

Richard has made a phone call or he has lobbied.



MARLES: Do a comparison between Corio and Corangamite, like that is really it. Both

in Geelong, one a Liberal marginal, the other a Labor seat. There is no comparison at all.

This was a sandbagging the Liberal Party scheme; that is ultimately what it was. Bridget

McKenzie is going to stay there because she is protected by The National Party. I mean, in

this Government everyone is protected by someone. The person most who is going to be

most disappointed today with this news is Barnaby Joyce who is licking his lips for most of

the week.



STEFANOVIC: By the way he can be licking his lips because Michael McCormack has

not led at all. I mean, where has he been during this whole crisis? After all, it is his Deputy,

isn't it?



DUTTON: Karl, he has been out there-



STEFANOVIC: Nowhere.



DUTTON: He has answered questions-



STEFANOVIC: Via text or email



LANGDON: He is not fronting.



DUTTON: What else do you want him to do? He has backed his minister. And again, there

is a process in place. I think put the emotion aside and deal with the facts and wait to see

what the report has to say and then you can make a decision.



LANGDON: Is the issue here the Coalition has to back her because there is dirt on a lot

of hands here. A lot of ministers, a lot of MPs have been going to Bridget saying "I need

this and I need this." You can't sell it and say look at the facts. It's dirty.



DUTTON: When you vote for local MP, when you vote for- I don’t recommend it, but when

you vote for Richard Marles at the election-



LANGDON: That is a low blow, isn’t it.



DUTTON: He is actually going to stand up for your electorate. I mean, is it peculiar that in

Richard's electorate he would want additional funding for the local health service, for the

local school, whatever it may be. I mean, it is just bread and butter-



STEFANOVIC: A number of these grants given in seats that were marginal, heading

into an election where you didn't know you were going to win. And it just looks so bad. It

looks so bad.



MARLES: Most of the Sport Australia recommendations are ignored, that is the killer fact.



STEFANOVIC: As it stands, as we go into the weekend, Bridget stays where she is.



DUTTON: Yes, she does.



LANGDON: And no Cabinet reshuffle?



DUTTON: No, no Cabinet reshuffle. I think that the Prime Minister made the point before

Christmas that everyone is doing a good job-



MARLES: Everyone is doing a good job? Angus Taylor, Stuart Robert, Bridget McKenzie- I

mean you must be pulling your hair-  I suppose you are not pulling your hair-



STEFANOVIC: Ohh. Gee.



LANGDON: That is a low blow.



STEFANOVIC: By the way, Peter, by the way it stands to reason though, that even if there

was going to be a reshuffle that you would know about it.



DUTTON: How would I know about it? It is with the Prime Minister. So, I mean, is

Anthony Albanese going to have a reshuffle, is Bill Shorten going to be promoted?



LANGDON: Well, I don’t know. We saw him pop his head up.



STEFANOVIC: Ali and I pointed out this week we saw Bill pop his head up and he was

talking about Scotty from marketing. Is Bill Shorten making a run again? Is he on the

comeback trial?



DUTTON: You were his numbers man last year.



STEFANOVIC: Is he?



MARLES: Bill Shorten is doing a great job.



STEFANOVIC: You are evading the questions now.



DUTTON: You said that before the election.



MARLES: And Bill Shorten did a great job as the Leader of the Labor Party.



STEFANOVIC: Is he on the comeback trail?



MARLES: No, listen, listen. Robodebt; you have walked away from robodebt which is

great achievement of Bill Shorten in his role. Bill is absolutely dedicated to the role



DUTTON: Why isn't he a leader then?



MARLES: Bill stepped down having led our Party really well over the last six years, end

of story.



STEFANOVIC: He just seems to be agitating now a little bit from the side.



MARLES: Bill is a frontbencher doing what frontbenchers do.



STEFANOVIC: Entitled to, entitled to talk from the sidelines.



MARLES: He is not talking from the sidelines, he is talk from the frontbench.



STEFANOVIC: Well, he may as well have a crack again.



MARLES: He is doing a great job on the frontbench. Anthony Albanese is doing a

wonderful job leading our Labor Party. We’re a very happy team. It is very different from

that lot.



STEFANOVIC: The other interesting story that is coming out Peter, another one of your

colleagues has been forced to defend themselves. This time it is Federal Health Minister,

Greg Hunt who is accused of interfering in an independent review which could benefit a

major Liberal Party donor’s company. I mean, that just looks and that smells bad as well.



DUTTON: Again it is just false Karl. We have been led in today's society by Twitter feeds

from anonymous people. I think that we need to strip that emotion away. As I keep saying,

lets sticks to the facts.



STEFANOVIC: No case to answer?



DUTTON: No he hasn’t. He has made that very clear.



STEFANOVIC: Are any of you trustworthy at the moment.



DUTTON: I think we are trustworthy, Karl.



STEFANOVIC: You think?



LANGDON: You think that the public believe so?



DUTTON: I think that the public has a very cynical outlook on politicians, full stop. Have

had for generations.



LANGDON: But why do you think that is?



MARLES: Your Government isn’t helping that.



DUTTON: Will do for generations.



LANGDON: Why do you think that is?



DUTTON: I think we need more support from the media. I mean, you are trusted

people within the Australian community. We need you to speak nicely about us.



LANGDON: You have to earn our trust.



STEFANOVIC: We are talking fairly nicely, Ali and I, aren't we?



LANGDON: Keeping it civil.



DUTTON: Yeah, well, let’s take it to the tennis court.



STEFANOVIC: Alright.



LANGDON: I actually don’t mind that idea.



STEFANOVIC: Yeah, no we can do that.



LANGDON: Who is the best player out of you two?



MARLES: I am sure Peter is.



DUTTON: He is the naturally gifted sportsman, as he keeps saying. So expectation is high.



MARLES: I never said that.



LANGDON: You know what; I am going to put you to the test here.



STEFANOVIC: Just grab a racquet… he is made of granite.



DUTTON: Don't encourage him.



LANGDON: You are talking the talk, let's walk the walk gentlemen. You have got to get the

chairs out of the way.



STEFANOVIC: You have to bang it up against the wall-



MARLES: What do you want us to do?





STEFANOVIC: Up against Parliament House there. And Pete, you will have to get this on

the first bounce.



LANGDON: I will keep the spare balls off to the side.



DUTTON: Where is your racquet?



STEFANOVIC: These are the borders here you can't go past them or let any in.



DUTTON: I will police those borders.



MARLES: So we are hitting up here?



STEFANOVIC: Can hit, wow! That is Stylish. Ooh!



LANGDON: That was a cracker of a ball girl.



STEFANOVIC: There you go folks we will let the pollies play. Keep on going guys and

thank you for being with here today.
