*** CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY ***



Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today.



It’s a pleasure to be here.



I would like to begin today by acknowledging the Traditional Owners, the Turrbal and

Jagera peoples, on whose land we meet, and pay my respects to their Elders, past,

present and emerging.



I would also like to acknowledge:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Repatriation Commissioner Mr Don Spinks AM;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ RSL Queensland State President Mr Tony Ferris as our host today;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Distinguished guests, including representatives from my electorate of Blair; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ All members of the RSL Queensland who are here in person or attending via

audio-visual link today.

As the largest ex-service organisation in Queensland with 240 RSL Sub Branches across

10 districts, I know you all make a huge contribution to our local communities.



As the Federal Labor Party, we want to work with you to advocate for the best possible

conditions for those who have served, and promote a spirit of respect, gratitude and

support.



In particular, we want to see real, tangible support for veterans and their families.



The year, 2020, has been a very challenging year for our defence and veteran community,

as it has been for the nation.



I know the coronavirus pandemic has posed huge challenges for RSL Queensland, its Sub

Branches and veterans in our community.



At the onset of the pandemic, I reached out to RSL National, RSL Queensland and other

ex-service organisations like Mates4Mates to see what support was needed and where

Labor could assist.



The early feedback was that more resources would be needed for frontline mental health

and welfare services to support current and ex-service personnel, and particularly older

vulnerable veterans who were self-isolating and at greater risk of loneliness.



I then wrote to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs Darren Chester in April to ask him, among

other things, to increase the Department of Veterans’ Affairs’ fees for mental health

services, including psychologists and psychiatrists, to help reduce the long wait times for

veterans seeing mental health professionals.



So it was pleasing to see the Government finally respond by increasing DVA fees paid to

mental health, social work and community nursing providers in the October Federal

Budget.



However, there is still a way to go in improving access to these services in many parts of

the country and it was disappointing that the Government did not also increase DVA fees

for allied health workers, including physiotherapists and occupational therapists.



Labor was disappointed that the Government’s stimulus packages did not include more

support for charities, which is why we called for additional assistance, noting many RSL

Sub-Branches are volunteer-run and don’t qualify for the JobKeeper payment.



Of course, Anzac Day commemorations were very different this year.



But the nation was able to find new and innovative ways to commemorate the day and

honour those who have served.



It was fantastic to see the community embrace the RSL’s “Light up the Dawn” initiative,

which encouraged people to commemorate the occasion in their own personal way at

home.



And on 15 August this year, we marked the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second

World War and Victory in the Pacific, and saluted an extraordinary generation of soldiers,

sailors, air men and women, and nurses - 12,000 of whom are still with us today.



I want to commend RSL Queensland for its outstanding support for Sub Branches and

veterans during this time, especially through initiatives like its veteran homelessness and

employment programs.



We know more veterans than ever have been reaching out for help through the pandemic.



I note in July, RSL Queensland reported a 26 per cent increase in enquiries to its

homelessness program, 39 per cent growth in its wellbeing services, and a 113 per cent

increase in employment enquiries.



This comes on top of shocking national figures indicating around 5,800 ex-servicemen and

women were homeless in a 12-month period and one in 10 people sleeping rough are

veterans.



Indeed, a number of recent reports have shown that far too many of our veterans are

slipping through the cracks and struggling to cope with life after serving with the ADF.



So I’m pleased to hear RSL Queensland has really stepped up in response to these

challenges and expanded its wellbeing, compensation support, and homelessness and

employment programs.



Labor has called on the Morrison Government to step up and do its part too - it can’t just

leave it all to the States and ESOs.



The fact is the Government needs to do more to support our defence personnel when it

comes to transitioning out of the ADF and into civilian life - through assistance

employment and housing - and more fundamentally with mental health and suicide

prevention.



The release last week of the report by the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence

Force inquiry into allegations of war crimes committed by Australian Special Forces in

Afghanistan was a difficult moment for the nation, and for our defence and veteran

community.



I want to acknowledge the statement by RSL Queensland last week on this matter and

associate Federal Labor with those sentiments.



Labor agrees that the allegations in the report in respect of a few do not detract from the

sacrifice of the many who have served our country, and in particular the thousands of

current and former soldiers who served in Afghanistan.



This will be distressing for many who have shown extraordinary bravery in speaking up

about what they saw and knew was inappropriate conduct, and for veterans more

generally.



This is why it’s vitally important that individuals and their families have access to all the

support services they need.



Already there have been reports that nine serving and former defence personnel have

taken their own lives in the past three weeks alone, which is a tragedy.



In the last month, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported that there were 33

suicide deaths among serving and ex-serving ADF personnel in 2018, and 465 suicides

between 2001 and 2018, although many believe the actual figures are much higher.



Shockingly, the report showed that the rate of suicide among male veterans was 21 per

cent that than general male population, the rate of suicide among ex-serving women is

twice as high as the general female population, and male veterans who discharged for

medical reasons had a 66 per cent higher suicide rate compared to men who discharged

voluntarily.



Labor’s view is that nothing less than a full and independent Royal Commission into

veteran suicide will let us get to bottom of this terrible scourge and help prevent these

needless deaths in the future.



We cautiously welcomed the Government’s announcement back in February of a

permanent National Commissioner for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention.



But since then, like many veterans and their families, we’ve become concerned that a

National Commissioner won’t operate as the Government has claimed and could end up

being little more than a glorified Federal coroner, with in-house desktop reviews of past

suicides and hearings held in secret - keeping the issue behind closed doors and out of

the public domain.



Labor referred the legislation for the National Commissioner to a Senate Committee inquiry

so it could be thoroughly examined, and so veterans, families and advocates could have

their say.



The Senate inquiry held a public hearing last week and a number of organisations and

individuals appeared as witnesses.



Many veterans and family members told the inquiry they have serious concerns with the

Government’s proposed National Commissioner and preferred a Royal Commission into

veteran suicide.



A majority of witnesses believed the scope of the role was too narrow and that former ACT

Magistrate and now interim National Commissioner Dr Bernadette Boss was not

sufficiently independent given her long association with the ADF.



While Labor has no personal criticism of Dr Boss, we note the Government announced her

appointment before the legislation was even debated in Parliament and without any

significant consultation with stakeholders.



We would have thought a retired Supreme or Federal Court Judge, for example, who

brings ‘fresh eyes’ to the issue, would have been a more appropriate appointment.



The Senate inquiry will report back by 30 November and in the meantime, Labor will

continue to engage with the veteran community and stakeholders, and will come to a final

position on the legislation once we have seen the outcomes of the inquiry and any

Government response.



But we have serious concerns that the National Commissioner won’t have the resources or

the independence from government to ask the really hard questions that a Royal

Commission can.



And we think it would have been preferable that any permanent standing body be informed

first by the recommendations of a Royal Commission.



In the context of the IGADF inquiry, the best thing the Government could do right now is to

show faith with veterans and their families, and commit to establishing a Royal

Commission into veteran suicide, so we can tackle this national shame once and for all.



In closing, I’d like to thank you again for inviting me here today.



I look forward to continuing to work with you to deliver better outcomes for our Queensland

veterans.



And I would like to particularly acknowledge all you do for those who have served our

nation and their loved ones, and the wider community, especially during these challenging

times.



Keep up the great work.



Thank you.
