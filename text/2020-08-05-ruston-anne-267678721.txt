ANNELISE NIELSEN:

Actually we're going to go live now to the Social Services Minister Anne Ruston. Anne  Ruston, thank you for joining us live here on Sky News. 250,000 Victorians will after today  be losing their jobs. The concern for many is what they do next. Should they be going  straight to Centrelink?

MINISTER RUSTON:

Well look, clearly anybody who has lost their job, we would be saying to them please go  straight to Centrelink either on line or on the phone because there are a range of supports  that are in place. Now whether it be the JobSeeker payments with the additional coronavirus  supplement and all the other supports that stick with that, or in the case of people that find  themselves in a situation where they're required to isolate or quarantine, the pandemic  disaster payment is also available. For those businesses that have had a downturn of more  than 30 per cent clearly there's the JobKeeper option. So there are a range of things that  people can do but certainly contacting Centrelink or going online to the  servicesaustralia.gov.au website and having a look at that information will be a very good  place to start.

ANNELISE NIELSEN:

At the beginning of the pandemic, response in Australia was those lines around the block at  Centrelink offices with people who'd abruptly lost their jobs, not knowing what to do, not  knowing where to go. Are you confident that the services are in place so people who won't  have a job after tomorrow will be able to access that support quickly?





MINISTER RUSTON:

Well look certainly. The provisions that were put in place, the new technology that was put in  place back in March when we had that massive surge of people coming onto payment is still  in place. So we have significantly enhanced the capability. But clearly, we'd be saying to  Victorians particularly, but anybody who finds themselves without a job or requiring  Centrelink services to either go online or to ring. There have been extra resources put onto  the phone lines this morning to make sure that people are able to get through in a matter of  minutes. I mean clearly if we had massive, massive surges, people may have to sit on the  phone for a little while, but we're very confident that the increased capacity that we have  should see people not having to sit on telephones for terribly long and our capacity online is  massively enhanced. So we're very confident that that will meet the demand.

ANNELISE NIELSEN:

The PM today has said this should be extended to all the states and territories. Would you  support that paid being expanded?

MINISTER RUSTON:

Well clearly, the Prime Minister has made the offer to all the states and territories around  Australia that if they find themselves in a circumstance where they believe that they need  this paid pandemic leave disaster payment then they should come to the Government and  start discussions. I mean, when we've been in discussions with Victoria for some time.  Victoria's playing their role. This is a partnership. It's a cooperative arrangement and if other  states and territories want to avail themselves of the same service then please come forward  and we're very open to discussions with them.

ANNELISE NIELSEN:

Labor and union groups in particular are saying that this is taking too long. It needs to  happen now because the concern is that outbreaks will happen because people are going to  work because they don't have that support, and we could avoid what we've seen in Victoria  happening in other states. Is this taking too long?

MINISTER RUSTON:

Well clearly we are now in a position where we have this payment in place and so we would  say to the Premiers and Chief Ministers of all the other states and territories, if you think that  your situation warrants the extension of this payment to your state or territory, the offer is  absolutely there. The Prime Minister has said it this morning in media and has clearly made  it very clear to all of the state and territories that this offer is on the table if they wish to avail  themselves of it.

ANNELISE NIELSEN:

Do you think Victoria should have implemented it sooner?

MINISTER RUSTON:

Well, Victoria actually put a number of provisions in place and they did have a leave system,  a paid two-week payment to people who found themselves in a situation where they either

had to quarantine because they had been in contact with someone or had been diagnosed  as having the virus. It's been in place for a whole, but the Federal Government has agreed,  in partnership with the Victorian Government, that we will pick up the cost associated with  providing this two-week payment to Australian citizens and residents and the Victorian  Government has agreed to pick up the cost of providing this two-week payment to temporary  visa holders that are in Victoria.

ANNELISE NIELSEN:

So for those 250,000 Victorians that are hitting the jobless queue this way, what's your best  advice?

MINISTER RUSTON:

Well first of all, I'd say please make sure that you go and have a look at the information that  is available on the servicesaustralia.gov.au website. Please test your eligibility. And it's not  just for people who've lost their jobs. If people find themselves with insecure work or they've  had reduced hours or reduced income they may also be eligible for receiving some payment.  Back in March we made a change to eligibility which no longer required people to be actually  unemployed and have a separation certificate to be able to get access to payment. So what  we're saying to those people, if you have significantly reduced or you have very low amount  of money coming into your household you should also test your eligibility because if you are  under the threshold of the fortnightly income threshold, you will receive some payment and if  you receive some payment you get the coronavirus supplement. So I would certainly be  encouraging people who are feeling insecure, test your eligibility with Centrelink. You may  actually be eligible for some top-up payment.

ANNELISE NIELSEN:

Social Services Minister Anne Ruston, thank you for your time.

MINISTER RUSTON:

Thanks Annelise.
