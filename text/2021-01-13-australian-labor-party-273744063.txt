TOURISM INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO BE LET DOWN BY MORRISON

GOVERNMENT



There can be no doubt that tourism is one of the most severely impacted industries

by the COVID-19 pandemic.



New national visitor survey results, released today by Tourism Research Australia,

shows the sector lost another $2.9 billion in October alone.



This is another blow to a critical industry which had already lost $36.1 billion from

declining domestic tourism revenue, without even considering the cost of the huge

losses from international visitor revenue.



But this is not news to the Morrison Government.



Over the past 15 months they have watched as the tourism industry struggled

through devastating bushfires which was then all but eclipsed by the impact of

COVID-19.





They watched as the sector haemorrhaged 136,500 jobs.



They watched as tourism made its smallest contribution to the Australian economy

in 16 years.



They watched as internationally reliant businesses and regions struggled to stay

afloat due to the necessary restrictions that halted our $45.4 billion international

visitor market.



It is clear the Morrison Government have abandoned this critical sector which is

continuing to be significantly impacted by COVID-19, failing to provide a plan to

protect jobs or target support and things will only get worse as JobKeeper and

JobSeeker are wound back.



Tourism is vital to our economy, sustaining 300,000 odd businesses and

employing over one million Australians.



The Government must deliver a clear plan to support the entire sector through this

crisis, preventing hundreds of thousands more jobs being lost and ensuring that

operators survive to drive our national economic recovery into the future
