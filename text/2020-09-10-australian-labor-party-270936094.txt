SPLASHY ANNOUNCEMENTS BUT MORRISON GOVERNMENT DELIVERS

JUST 300 MORE HOME CARE PACKAGES



New evidence has revealed the Morrison Government will deliver just 300 ‘new’ home care

packages by 2024 despite a series of announcements promising tens of thousands more.



Documents tendered at the Aged Care Royal Commission show that hundreds of millions

of dollars in funding  promised for thousands of packages will result in just 300 additional

packages by 2024.



Scott Morrison and his failed Minister for Aged Care promised older Australians a lot but

are failing to deliver. Morrison is always there for the photo op but never the follow up.



There are still more than 103,000 older Australians waiting for home care.



Almost 30,000 older Australians died waiting for care in just two years and more than

30,000 went into aged care homes prematurely.



COVID-19 will only accelerate the number of older Australians wanting to receive aged

care at home, but in return the Morrison Government has offered them just 300 ‘new’

packages.



This is exactly why Labor’s 8-point plan for aged care called on the Government to



properly fix the home care crisis.



The upcoming Budget is an opportunity to not just offer more announcements, but genuine

action for older Australians waiting for care.



Day after day the evidence mounts of serious neglect in aged care and every day all we

see from the Morrison Government is running away, passing the buck and not accepting

responsibility for its own failures.



Neglect. That’s the legacy of this Government when it comes to aged care.



Australians deserve better on aged care- they deserve honesty.
