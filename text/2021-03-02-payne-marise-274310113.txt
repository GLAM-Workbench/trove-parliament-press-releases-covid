STATEMENT



2 March 2021

Over 14,000 Defence personnel, through Operation COVID-19 ASSIST, have already supported  the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including contact tracing, emergency clinical  support, border control measures, swab testing, and support to hotel quarantine.

As part of the continued expansion of the phase 1A COVID-19 vaccine rollout, the Australian  Defence Force will provide supplementary support to the rollout of vaccines to Australians in  aged care.

As we move into the next phase of the aged care vaccine rollout and continue the expansion of  teams, additional nurses, pharmacists and providers are being added, with ADF vaccination  teams supplementing these efforts.

The teams are expected to start next week and will build on the planning, logistics, and  operations support Defence personnel are already providing to the Department of Health’s  COVID-19 Vaccination Taskforce.

Defence’s support to the vaccine rollout will focus on vaccinating senior Australians in locations  not readily accessible by other medical providers.

This is another important role the ADF is playing in protecting Australians against COVID, as  they have throughout the pandemic.
