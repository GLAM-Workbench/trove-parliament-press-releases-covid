MEETING OF MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS MINISTERS

Today the Queensland Government is hosting a ministerial forum for multicultural affairs.  For the first time in nearly a decade ministerial colleagues from around the country will  meet to discuss the biggest issues affecting multicultural communities in Australia.

Sadly, the Morrison Government is not sending a representative to this important forum.

Not only does the Morrison Government fail to provide leadership in the area of  multicultural affairs, it doesn’t even show up when it has the opportunity to collaborate with  the states and territories.

I congratulate the Queensland Government and Minister Stirling Hinchcliffe for their  leadership.

Bringing together the nation’s multicultural affairs ministers from around Australia will  provide a pathway to develop coherent national policies.

Labor wants to bring diverse communities together to benefit all Australians, unfortunately  the Morrison Government continues to ignore our multicultural communities.

This is a difficult time for many Australians - we need to ensure that all Australians are  receiving relevant and timely information about Coronavirus, particularly elderly residents  in our multicultural communities.
