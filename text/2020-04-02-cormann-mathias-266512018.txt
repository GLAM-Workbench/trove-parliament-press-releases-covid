AUDITOR GENERAL REVIEW OF THE USE OF THE LEGISLATED ADVANCE  TO THE FINANCE MINISTER

The Australian National Audit Office each year reviews the annual report prepared by the  Department of Finance on the use of the Advances to the Finance Minister during any given  year.

That report is tabled in Parliament.

This already happens as a matter of course, it is appropriately already business as usual and  will of course apply in relation to the use of the $40 billion Advance legislated by the  Parliament.

Given the size of the Advance to the Finance Minister approved by the Parliament last week,  I also committed to issue regular updates on each use on every Friday where one or more  determinations have been made in that week to allocate funding from an Advance.

Beyond that the Government agreed that I would seek the concurrence of the Shadow  Finance Minister, on behalf of the Opposition, for any given proposed expenditure above  $1bn.

The Government welcomes scrutiny of the overall COVID-19 Economic Response Package,  given its size and significance.

In relation to the Advance to the Finance Minister, there are longstanding well established  transparency and reporting requirements in place, which we have further enhanced in the  current context.

We will continue to work constructively with the Opposition and all Members of Parliament  as we work to protect peopleâ€™s health and support Australians through this crisis.
