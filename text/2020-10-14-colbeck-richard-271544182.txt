TASMANIA VIRTUAL JOBS FAIR CONNECTS  JOB SEEKERS WITH EMPLOYERS

A virtual jobs fair showcasing employment opportunities around Tasmania will be held on  Wednesday 14 October 2020.

The Tasmania Virtual Jobs Fair, funded by the Australian Government, will bring together  job seekers and local businesses, to promote job opportunities available across the state.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said the Tasmania Virtual Jobs Fair provides opportunities for people in Tasmania who  are looking for work to interact online with employers and employment service providers.

“As our nation continues to recover from COVID-19, the Government is committed to  connecting job seekers with businesses who are looking to hire,” Minister Cash said.

“As demonstrated by last week’s federal Budget, skills development and job creation is at the  heart of the Government’s recovery plan for Australia.

“The Australian Government has held Jobs Fairs in many locations around  Australia with more than 39,100 people having attended these events since July 2018.”

Senator for Tasmania, the Hon Richard Colbeck, said the Tasmania Virtual Jobs Fair is  essential for anyone who wants to connect with local businesses that are recruiting in the  region.

“I encourage local job seekers to take advantage of the range of information that will be  available online” Senator Colbeck said.

“The Tasmania Virtual Jobs Fair will provide job seekers with information including how to  get job ready, improve their resume and their employment opportunities.”

The Tasmania Region Virtual Jobs Fair is a free online event from 9.30 am to 1.30 pm  (AEDT) on Wednesday 14 October 2020.

Registrations are required for the event and can be made via:  www.employment.gov.au/TasmaniaVJF
