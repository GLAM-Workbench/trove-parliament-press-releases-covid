SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

LABOR SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA





DR YANG HENGJUN



Labor joins the Government in its objection to the formal indictment of

Australian citizen and academic, Dr Yang Hengjun, in China on suspicion of

espionage.



Dr Yang has been detained for over a year, during which Labor has expressed

our concern for his treatment in detention.



Labor strongly supports the Government’s advocacy for Dr Yang and is

disappointed that he has not received basic standards of justice or procedural

fairness, and that his charges remain unclear.



Labor is also distressed that Australian consular officials have not been

permitted contact with Dr Yang since December 2019. In the wake of the

COVID-19 outbreak and given Dr Yang’s health concerns, it is vital that

Australian officials are granted consular access.



Labor affirms the Government’s statement that the Australian Government will

always support Dr Yang.





We join the Government’s call for Dr Yang’s immediate release and that he be

allowed to leave China and travel to Australia with his wife.
