ALBANESE MUST EXPLAIN LABOR’S 2030 TARGET BACKFLIP

Media reports today have revealed that the Labor Party has quietly erased all references  to a 2030 or 2035 emissions reduction target from its policy platform.

The Paris Agreement requires all countries to communicate a 2030 target.

Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said “either Labor is no  longer committed to Paris, or they have accepted the Government’s sensible emissions  reduction target.”

“Australians deserve to know what Labor’s 2030 target is and how much it will cost  them” Angus Taylor said.

“What we do know is that the climate change plan Labor took to the last election would  have had a disastrous impact on the economy, cutting the wages and jobs of Australian  workers.  It would have made Australia’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic that  much harder”.

The Australian Government is committed to reducing emissions by 26 to 28 per cent on  2005 levels by 2030.  We’ve beaten our Kyoto-era targets by up to 430 million tonnes  and as a nation we’ve done far better than similar export-oriented economies, with  emissions now 14.3 per cent below 2005 levels. This is an achievement all Australians  can be proud of.

As Australia’s economy recovers from COVID-19, a technology not taxes approach that  doesn’t compromise energy affordability or reliability is more important than ever.

Through the Technology Investment Roadmap, the Government will back new and  emerging technologies that will create jobs, strengthen our economy and reduce  emissions.
