TRANSCRIPT

INTERVIEW WITH KATIE WOOLF, MIX 104.9 DARWIN  11 August 2020





E&OE

Subjects: Northern Territory Election;

KATIE WOOLF

Well, thanks for joining us, sneaking in there while we played that bit of audio talking about the  hotspots for the Northern Territory and we're all a little confused this morning because we thought  that the Chief Minister had maybe announced that the hard borders are back in place. It seems  that's not the case, we are sticking with this hotspot policy. Otherwise, you might find yourself  quarantining here for 14 days.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, there’d be worse places to quarantine in, they might worry when I didn't return to Parliament,  but that wouldn't be so bad to be stuck in Darwin, would it?

KATIE WOOLF

It’s a good place to be, no doubt about it, particularly during what is a real health crisis for the rest of  the nation and we are going pretty well here in the Territory at the moment.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Look, I've just got off the phone from the Prime Minister and he made that very point.

KATIE WOOLF

And how is the Prime Minister, is he wishing that he could come to the Territory at the moment?







MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, it'd be a lot warmer than where he is at the moment but then when I left Wagga Wagga on  Saturday, it was minus two overnight and I got up here and it was about 31ÃÂC. So it's very nice. Look,  I love Darwin, I love the Northern Territory and I'm a regular visitor here. You know I am here to  support Lia Finocchiaro obviously and the Country Liberal Party team and Senator Sam McMahon  and they're doing a great job.

KATIE WOOLF

Well, Matt Canavan was here last week, you're obviously here this week, the CLP certainly bought in  the big guns in the lead in to the election. I mean realistically, there is a bit of a push from The  Nationals, you’d have to say, to support the CLP here in the Territory, you must feel pretty strongly  that the Gunner Government maybe isn't doing the best job that they could be?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Look, I know back in May when Lia announced that every Territorian was going to be saddled with a  $25,000 debt to pay back the $6.2 billion as it was then - it's now blown out to $8.2 billion. So what  we don't want to see is Territorians being saddled with even further debt and that is the unfortunate  situation. Re-elect the Michael Gunner Labor Government for another four years and the spiralling  debt will only increase and Lia has a plan, she's got a blueprint, a vision to get out of that. She's put  up a platform of policy for jobs, safety and opportunity. I could think of no three finer principles  upon which to have an election campaign and so I say, go Lia! Vote number one Lia!

KATIE WOOLF

Well, I mean, a lot of those things are easier said than done and we know that there's a lot of talk  about diversifying the economy at the moment and diversifying industry. But what do you think we  could really be doing differently here in the Northern Territory in order to do that?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, when you say easier said than done, you're right. But what I'm really impressed about is the  fact that should she be elected Chief Minister on Saturday week, she's going to take the Police  portfolio. So she's going to not only talk the talk when it comes to crime, she's going to actually walk  the walk and she's going to make sure that the measures that are put into place by her Government  and certainly as far as anti-crime measures are concerned, that she's leading the way. That takes a  bit of guts when a politician who could take an infrastructure portfolio or take another portfolio  which might not have that day-to-day pressure, yes, they've all got day-to-day pressures but she  could easily take a different portfolio. But, she's prepared to lead from the front and that's what I'm  so impressed about her. Look, Territorians - I know lot of them already voted yesterday, polling  opened yesterday and I was at one polling booth with, you know, hundreds upon hundreds.







KATIE WOOLF

More than 6,000 people have voted already -

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Indeed, across the Territory. That's a lot of people and so with the COVID-situation, people are being  encouraged and urged to vote early. But of course, the big day is Saturday week, August 22 and after  that, we'll see what happens.

KATIE WOOLF

Well, just to go back though, to, you know, the way that we could be doing things differently and  obviously, there's a lot of discussion about the Northern Territory’s debt at this point in time. And I  know the Chief Minister Michael Gunner last week, made some comments about seeing whether the  Federal Government could potentially wipe some historical debt, is that something that's realistically  even on the cards?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

We will work with the Northern Territory Government going forward as we do with the ACT too and  the six states. We always work with our with governments of any political persuasion, but it makes it  a whole lot easier when you've got a government in there who knows how to handle money, it  makes it easy when you've got a government which has an economic plan. Lia has, I’m not so sure  that Labor does have.

KATIE WOOLF

I mean? Do you feel like they're flying blind with the economy?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, it’s easy to spend other people's money and that's what Labor Governments do. And generally,  when CLP, National, Liberal Governments take over, they are saddled with a big debt that they then  work hard to repay and they repay it without burdening people with big taxes - that's the Labor  way. They do it by growing the economy. They do it by growing agriculture. They do it by making full  use of the resources that are available and this Territory is blessed with natural attributes and  resources and assets. And so we want to make sure that we take advantage of those by building  more water infrastructure, by building better roads to get product to port quicker and then of  course, we can avail ourselves of all of those export opportunities that we've grown and created  over the past six years, federally.











KATIE WOOLF

Speaking of some of those major projects, we would obviously like to see things get moving in the  Territory and a lot of those things do require support from the Federal Government, when you talk  about water infrastructure and things like that. The NAIF is seen as being one of the things that is  incredibly helpful in this space. Now the Federal Opposition reckons that it could take more than a  century though to spend the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facilities total $5 billion in project  loans if funding’s released at the current rate. Labor's spokesman for Northern Australia, Murray  Watt, was out yesterday saying that an analysis of the NAIF’s annual reports and questions on notice  show that over $33 million - nearly the same amount released for projects yearly - has been spent  on executive and staff salaries, as well as office space, travel, board directors, advertising and more  over the duration of the NAIF. Is the NAIF just far too slow and cumbersome?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Keith Pitt has made changes to the NAIF to ensure that more money gets out the door quicker but of  course, as with any fund, it has to be accountable. It has to be transparent. And as with any fund, if  private entities or governments or whoever are playing in that space, then any proposal that they  bring to the Commonwealth needs to have the ruler very much run over it. It needs to - at the end  of the day - have the Auditor-General's tick of approval long off into the distance. And so any project  that is approved today, must stack up tomorrow. So that's what Keith Pitt is doing with the NAIF.  We've shown a commitment to Northern Australia, we’re the first government to actually have a  Minister for Northern Australia. So Matt Canavan, now Keith Pitt, are doing great jobs in that area.  Matt, as you said earlier, was just up here last week, talking to people and more importantly  listening to people and their ideas.

KATIE WOOLF

Is that true though? That there's more money being spent on executive and staff salaries and office  space than what there is, you know, actually being invested?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

That's why Keith Pitt has tweaked the rules, has tweaked the arrangements, has tweaked the  principles and protocols around the NAIF to ensure that more money can get out the door and these  things do take a lot of money to establish, these things do take a lot of money to get up off the  ground, these things do take a lot of money in accountability and transparency. But everything with  the NAIF is geared to boosting Northern Australia and that, of course, largely includes the Top End.  So Keith - having been up here not that long ago - I know we've already discussed my trip here this  week. We've discussed it at length and what we can do to make sure that some of that loan money  can get out the door to players in the Northern Territory to build the Northern Territory economy  because that is what is needed. It's not more taxes - that’s the Labor way. Lia’s got a plan, working  with us, with the NAIF to build the Northern Territory economy.







KATIE WOOLF

Are there any sort of particular industries that you'd like to see invested in, that you'd really like to  see get moving here in the Territory?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

So where do you start? Where do you stop? I mean, there's so much! There's gas, there's all sorts of  mining and the mineral wealth here is quite extraordinary and of course, those rare earths. We want  to explore and utilise many more of those rare earths that are now so valuable in all sorts of things  from mobile phone technology to everything else. We want to make sure that we grow agriculture  and of course, The Nationals, well we were the Party that made sure that that terrible decision back  in June 2011, to stop the live export cattle industry that we didn't progress with legal action against  those proponents who were so unfairly treated by the Labor Government back in 2011. But that's  Labor Governments all over. They treat people unfairly and then they wonder why the economy is in  such bad shape.

KATIE WOOLF

I'll tell you what, there's some fighting words going around in the next two weeks, no doubt about  that ahead of the Northern Territory election.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Bring it on.

KATIE WOOLF

Now, I do want to ask you while you're in the studio though, two Members of Federal Parliament  currently, obviously in Canberra representing the Northern Territory, those numbers are set to go  down to one in the House of Representatives. Do you support this happening or should we keep two  seats?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

We'll have those discussions but the Northern Territory is a very, very large place and what  representation for people means is that they have access to their local Member - their local House  of Representatives Member or, in the case of Sam McMahon, they’re Upper House Member. But  what we want to make sure is that regional people have access and so when you look at the map of  the Northern Territory, it's a long way from Alice to Katherine, it's a long way to Tennant Creek, it's a  long way to Darwin. I know, I represent a large electorate but my electorate being about 50,000-square-kilometres pales into insignificance with the size of the Northern Territory and so for that  Member who represents Solomon or Lingiari, they need to be able to get around and represent their  people and have accessibility to their people. But I've got to tell you, I bumped into Warren  Snowdon, as the small as the world is, I bumped into him walking down the street last night and we





chatted about it and that's what you’d expect politicians to be doing, is chatting about these sorts of  things that are of interest to them. And moreover, of interest to their constituents. So, we'll have  those discussions going forward, I can see the benefit of having two seats in the Northern Territory.  But what we want to do is grow the population of the Northern Territory such that there's no  question about how many representatives it has. That's what we want to do and that's what Lia has  the plan to do. Grow the economy, therefore grow the population and therefore there won't be any  question as to how many seats that the Northern Territory has. In fact, it could even extend to more  than two - the ACT has and that's what we want to do, grow the population, grow the economy.

KATIE WOOLF

Well, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack, we are going to have to leave it there. Good to  catch up with you. Thanks so much for coming in.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Tremendous, thank you so much.
