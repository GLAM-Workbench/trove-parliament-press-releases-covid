ASSISTANCE MUST NOT REPEAT MORRISON’S PAST FAILURES

Support for small businesses facing economic pressures following the  compounding issues of bushfires, drought, floods and Coronavirus is urgent  and requires effective implementation.

The lazy and inadequate roll out of support for small business affected by  bushfires must not be repeated and Labor urges the government ensure the  new package is administered properly this time.

In a crisis, Australians need more than just talk, they need swift  implementation.

Questions remain as to whether the government can guarantee the wage  subsidies or cash for business will actually support jobs. Questions also remain  as to whether the package is targeted enough to impacted businesses.

Businesses in bushfire affected areas have been and continue to wait for  months for support, and should not be forgotten. The government must confirm  the new announcement does not repurpose any bushfire funds.   Businesses cannot wait another two months for assistance, money needs to  start flowing now.
