Support flows for live music across Australia

More than 100 venues across Australia will benefit from round one of the Live Music Australia  program that is designed to assist in the national recovery of the live music sector from the impacts of  COVID-19.

Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher MP today announced  the successful recipients of 88 grants, totalling more than $2.5 million, to support the immediate needs  of the Australian live music industry.

The program is funding venues in every state and territory, from pubs in the remote outback, to clubs  and theatres in major capital cities.

In congratulating the successful applicants, Minister Fletcher said the grants would help small to  medium venues bring more home-grown live music to Australian communities.

“These grants will fund upgrades to venues and equipment, help develop a venue’s capacity to present  live music professionally, and support restarting performances post COVID-19 restrictions,”  Minister Fletcher said.

“This funding will support the development, growth and innovation of Australian contemporary live  music by increasing performance opportunities to showcase the diverse talent of Australian artists.”

In August, the Government announced the opening of the Live Music Australia program, which will  deliver funding of $5 million annually over four years. The funding will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Enable businesses to build/rebuild their capacity for programming activity, as restrictions are  lifted and venues reopen;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Increase performance opportunities for original contemporary music by Australia artists; and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Support partnerships, collaboration and networks across the Australian live music industry.

Round two of the program is now open for applications. Round two will again provide support to small  to medium venues, as they begin to reopen and resume the regular performance of original Australian  live music. Applications for round two will close on 18 February 2021.

The Australian Government invests around $750 million in the arts and cultural sector each year  through a diverse range of programs. This program is part of the $30.9 million Australian Music  Industry Package announced in March 2019.
