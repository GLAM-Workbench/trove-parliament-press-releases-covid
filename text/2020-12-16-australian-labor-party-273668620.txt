OLDER AUSTRALIANS DYING FOR CARE DESERVE BETTER THAN A  DRIP FEED

The additional home care packages announced today by the Morrison Government are just  another drop in the ocean.

There will still be 100,000 older Australians waiting for a home care package this Christmas  and today’s announcement doesn’t come close to fixing this crisis.

Time and time again the Morrison Government’s announcements of new home care  packages have failed to address the true scale of Australia’s aged care crisis.

Over three years, more than 30,000 older Australians died waiting for home care that has  already been approved.

Older Australians waiting for high level home care are waiting almost three years to receive  the package they have been approved for.

How is it acceptable that older Australians in their 90s are waiting years to receive their  approved care?

The Morrison Government has not done enough to fix this crisis.

Today’s announcement also confirms MYEFO will have no new funding for residential aged  care. This is a terrible oversight after 685 older Australians died from COVID-19 in aged  care homes.

The Aged Care Royal Commission’s interim report detailed the crisis in aged care and was  titled ‘Neglect’.

It called for urgent action last year but there are still more than 100,000 older Australians  waiting for home care.

Despite a series of splashy announcements on ‘new’ home care packages, the Morrison  Government has failed to deliver real change for older Australians waiting for care.

Neglect. That’s the legacy of this Government when it comes to aged care.
