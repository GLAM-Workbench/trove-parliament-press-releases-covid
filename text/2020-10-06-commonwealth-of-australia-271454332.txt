JobMaker   Hiring Credit The JobMaker Hiring Credit will help to  accelerate growth in the employment of

young people during the COVID-19 recovery.  This will improve their economic, health and  social outcomes and reduce the scarring  from long term unemployment.

The JobMaker Hiring Credit will give businesses  incentives to take on additional young job  seekers. This will help young people access job  opportunities as the economy recovers.

The JobMaker Hiring Credit will be available to  employers for each new job they create over the  next 12 months for which they hire an eligible  young person, aged 16 to 35 years old.

It is expected that around 450,000 positions for  young Australians will be supported through  the JobMaker Hiring Credit at a cost of $4 billion  from 2020-21 to 2022-23.

Key facts From 7 October 2020, eligible employers will be  able to claim $200 a week for each additional  eligible employee they hire aged 16 to 29 years  old; and $100 a week for each additional eligible  employee aged 30 to 35 years old.

New jobs created until 6 October 2021 will  attract the JobMaker Hiring Credit for up to  12 months from the date the new position is  created.

To be eligible, the employee must have received  the JobSeeker Payment, Youth Allowance  (Other), or Parenting Payment for at least one of  the previous three months at the time of hiring.

The JobMaker Hiring Credit will be claimed  quarterly in arrears by the employer from  the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) from  1 February 2021. Employers will need to report

quarterly that they meet the eligibility criteria.

The JobMaker Hiring Credit is designed to  support new employment. Employers do not  need to satisfy a fall in turnover test.

The additionality criteria To attract the JobMaker Hiring Credit, the  employee must be in an additional job created  from 7 October 2020. To demonstrate that the

job is additional, specific criteria must be met.

The additionality criteria require that there is an  increase in:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the business’ total employee headcount  (minimum of one additional employee) from  the reference date of 30 September 2020; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the payroll of the business for the reporting  period, as compared to the three months to  30 September 2020.

The amount of the hiring credit claim cannot  exceed the amount of the increase in payroll for  the reporting period.

Total employee headcount on 30 September  2020 and payroll in the three months to

30 September 2020 represent the baseline  values for the employer.

The baseline headcount will be adjusted in  the second year of the program to ensure an  employer can only receive the JobMaker Hiring  Credit for 12 months for each additional position  created.

Employer eligibility  Employers are eligible to receive the JobMaker  Hiring Credit if they:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ have an Australian Business Number (ABN);

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ are up to date with tax lodgement  obligations;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ are registered for Pay As You Go (PAYG)  withholding;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ are reporting through Single Touch Payroll  (STP);

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ meet the additionality criteria;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ are claiming in respect of an eligible  employee; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ have kept adequate records of the paid hours  worked by the employee they are claiming  the hiring credit in respect of.

Newly established businesses

Newly established businesses and businesses  with no employees at the reference date  of 30 September 2020 are able to claim the  JobMaker Hiring Credit where they meet the  criteria. The minimum baseline headcount is  one, so employers who had no employees at  30 September 2020 or who were created after  this reference date will not be eligible for the  first employee hired, but will be eligible for the  second and subsequent eligible hires.

additional young job  seekers   —

Lisa’s Lamington Bakery  Lisa operates a bakery and baked goods  catering business with two employees.  She hires Angus on 7 October 2020. As  at 30 September 2020, Lisa had two other  employees and her quarterly payroll for July,  August and September 2020 was $30,000.

Lisa’s business is not receiving the JobKeeper  Payment.

Lisa’s employee baseline on 30 September 2020  is two employees and she had a quarterly  payroll of $30,000 in the September quarter  2020. To claim the JobMaker Hiring Credit,

her employee headcount and payroll for the  reporting period must exceed the baseline level.  Employee headcount is the value observed  on the final day of the reporting period, while  payroll is the total for the reporting period.

Angus is 25 and was receiving JobSeeker  Payments from 1 July 2020 to 31 October 2020.  While Angus has no guaranteed hours, Lisa  expects he will work 7 hours a day, three days  a week (that is, more than 20 hours a week on  average).

Following the end of the first reporting period  for the JobMaker Hiring Credit, Lisa compares  her situation to her baseline:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ On 30 September 2020 her baseline  headcount was 2 and her quarterly payroll  was $30,000.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ On 6 January 2021 (the final day of the first  reporting period), her headcount was 3 and  her payroll is calculated to be $39,000.

Lisa is therefore able to claim the JobMaker  Hiring Credit in the December quarter reporting  period of 7 October 2020 - 6 January 2021. Lisa’s  payment entitlement is calculated on a per day

basis. She is entitled to $200 per week for the  entire December quarter reporting period for  Angus.

The claim in respect of Angus is calculated   as follows:

x 92 days = $2,629

$200 per week

7 days

If the increase in quarterly payroll relative to the  baseline was less than this amount, then Lisa  would receive a payment equal to the value of  the payroll increase instead.

The ATO will calculate Lisa’s entitlement on  her behalf, once she has provided the relevant  information in her claim and as a part of her  ordinary reporting requirements in STP enabled  software.

Claiming after a change in employees

Lisa employs two new staff, Emma aged  28 and Jessica aged 32, who both start on  7 January 2021 and meet the employee eligibility  requirements. Angus resigns from his job at

Lisa’s business, effective as at 7 January 2021.

When claiming for the March quarter reporting  period (7 January 2021 to 6 April 2021), Lisa  again compares her current situation to her  baseline:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ On 30 September 2020, her baseline  headcount was 2 and her quarterly payroll  was $30,000.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ On 6 April 2021, her headcount was 4 and her  payroll for the reporting period was $52,000.

For the March quarter reporting period, as her  headcount is 2 above her baseline, Lisa can  claim for the 2 additional positions. Lisa notifies  the ATO through STP of the commencement  of Emma and Jessica on 7 January 2021, and  that Angus was no longer employed as at  7 January 2021.

As Emma is aged 28, she attracts the $200 rate  per full week, while Jessica attracts the $100  rate.

Emma at $200 per week =

x 90 days = $2,571

$200 per week

7 days

Jessica at $100 per week =

x 90 days = $1,286

$100 per week

7 days

Lisa’s total payment:  $3,857

If the increase in quarterly payroll relative to the  baseline was less than this amount, then Lisa  would receive a payment equal to the value of  the payroll increase instead.

The ATO will calculate Lisa’s entitlement on  her behalf, once she has provided the relevant  information in her claim and as a part of her  ordinary reporting requirements in STP enabled  software.

Claiming in the second year of the  program

On 7 October 2021, the JobMaker Hiring Credit  closes to new applications.

Employers can only claim a hiring credit for  a new position for 12 months. The 12 month  eligibility period for each new position begins  when an eligible employee is hired and  continues even if that employee departs.

7 October 2021 is 12 months from the date Lisa  hired her first eligible employee Angus. The rule  to limit claims for new jobs to 12 months means  her baseline headcount will increase from  7 October 2021, in line with her access to hiring

credits a year earlier.

Calculating the 20 hours per week

Dan is a 26 year old eligible casual employee  that commenced working for Lisa on 7 July 2021.  While Dan has no guaranteed hours, he typically  works around 30 hours a week.

Dan was unable to work some of his shifts as  intended.

While making a claim, Lisa will need to report  whether Dan worked on average at least  20 hours per week (based on hours paid) for  the full weeks he was employed in the period.

Dan has on average only worked 19 hours. As  a result, Lisa cannot claim in respect of Dan for  the reporting period, but may claim for him in  the next reporting period subject to meeting all  other eligibility criteria.

How and when do I lodge a claim for the  JobMaker Hiring Credit?

Employers can submit claims from  1 February 2021 (for new jobs created in the  first reporting period of 7 October 2020 to  6 January 2021). Employers will have three

months to submit claims following the opening  of the claim period.

When will I receive the JobMaker   Hiring Credit?

The JobMaker Hiring Credit will be paid quarterly  in arrears. Employers can claim the first  payment when claims open on 1 February 2021  (for new jobs created between 7 October 2020  and 6 January 2021).

How much is the JobMaker Hiring   Credit and who pays it?

For eligible employers who hire eligible  employees aged 16 to 29 years old at the time  of employment, the JobMaker Hiring Credit is  $200 a week. For eligible employers who hire  eligible employees aged 30 to 35 years old at  the time of employment, the JobMaker Hiring  Credit is $100 a week.

The ATO will pay the JobMaker Hiring Credit to  you, the employer.

How do I calculate my baseline   employee headcount and payroll?

For existing businesses operating before  30 September 2020, your employee headcount  is the number of employees you have at  30 September 2020 and your payroll is your  quarterly payroll for the three months to  30 September 2020.

If you are a new business or had no employees  at 30 September 2020, you will not be eligible for  the first employee hired, but will be eligible for  the second and subsequent eligible hires.

For example, Jack starts a new business  on 10 October 2020. His first employee is  Jeremy aged 31 years old who he hires on

15 October 2020. On 15 November 2020, Jack  hires Tim who is an eligible employee.  Because  Jack’s headcount at 30 September 2020 was zero,  he will not be able to claim the JobMaker Hiring  Credit for Jeremy who was his first employee,  but he may be eligible to claim for Tim.

Your headcount for each reporting period will  be taken from the last day of the reporting  period. For example, your employee headcount  will be measured at 6 January 2021 for the  first reporting period. Your payroll for each  reporting period is your total payroll across  the reporting period. Your payroll needs to be  higher than the baseline payroll to meet the  additionality criteria. If the increase in payroll  for the reporting period was less than the total  value of the credit that is being claimed, then  you will receive the value of the payroll increase  instead.

Does my baseline employee   headcount always remain the same?

No. In the second year of the program, your  baseline will increase in line with your access  to hiring credits a year earlier. This is to ensure  that the JobMaker Hiring Credit is only available  for up to 12 months from the date a new job  was created.

For example, if your baseline was 10 employees  at 30 September 2020 and you hired one  eligible additional employee on 15 October  2020, your baseline headcount would increase

to 11 employees from the reporting period  immediately following 15 October 2021. From  that reporting period onwards, you could only  claim for eligible employees who are above the  new baseline (that is, if you have 12 or more  employees).

Calculating Payments

Amount of payment

For eligible employees hired from  7 October 2020 until 6 October 2021 for up to  12 months, eligible employers will be able to  claim a maximum of:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $200 a week for each eligible additional  employee they hire aged 16 to 29 years old;  and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $100 a week for each eligible additional  employee aged 30 to 35 years old.

The amount will be the lesser of the amount  of the claim and the increase in payroll for the  reporting period relative to the baseline payroll.

Employees not employed for the whole  reporting period

The amount claimed for the reporting period  will be calculated on the number of days worked  in the reporting period.

If an eligible employee leaves your business,  and is replaced with another eligible employee,  you will continue to be able to claim in respect  of that position, up to a maximum of 12 months.   Replacing an employee does not reset the  maximum 12 month period.

Can I receive the JobMaker Hiring Credit for  any of my existing employees?

No, you can only claim the JobMaker Hiring  Credit for employees who were employed on or  after 7 October 2020.

Adjustments to the baseline

The baseline is the employee headcount  and quarterly payroll at 30 September 2020.  The baseline headcount will increase in the  reporting period immediately following  12 months from the date you receive the

hiring credit for an additional job created. This  will ensure the payment is only available for  12 months for each additional job created.

Interactions with other government  programs

Can I receive the JobKeeper Payment and the  JobMaker Hiring Credit at the same time?

No, you cannot receive the JobKeeper Payment  and the JobMaker Hiring Credit at the same time.   An employer receiving the JobKeeper Payment  can be eligible for the JobMaker Hiring Credit

once they have exited the JobKeeper Payment  and are no longer receiving the JobKeeper  Payment for any employees or business  participants. Eligibility for the hiring credit will  commence in the reporting period following  their JobKeeper exit date.

For example, Rohana’s Hair Salon in Melbourne  is eligible for the JobKeeper Payment extension  from 28 September 2020 to 3 January 2021,  but is not eligible for the JobKeeper Payment  extension from 4 January 2021 to 28 March 2021  as business improves in the December 2020  quarter. As the Hair Salon is no longer eligible

for the JobKeeper Payment from 4 January 2021,  Rohana can claim the JobMaker Hiring Credit for  hiring Max, a 25 year old qualified hair stylist  who had been receiving JobSeeker Payment,

for the 7 January 2021 - 6 April 2021 reporting  period.

Can I receive the JobMaker Hiring Credit and  other Commonwealth Government wage  subsidies for the same employee?

Employers cannot access more than one  Commonwealth wage subsidy program for the  same employee. This includes the Department  of Education, Skills and Employment’s wage  subsidies, the Boosting Apprenticeships

You can only claim  the JobMaker Hiring  Credit for employees  who were employed on

or after 7 October 2020  —

Commencements Wage Subsidy, the Supporting  Apprentices and Trainees Wage Subsidy, and the  Australian Apprentice Wage Subsidy Trial.

Eligibility for young people looking for  work

I am looking for work - am I eligible to  attract the JobMaker Hiring Credit?

If you are aged 16 to 35 years old and you  have received the JobSeeker Payment, Youth  Allowance (Other) or Parenting Payment for at  least one of the last three months at the time

you are hired, you will be eligible to attract the  JobMaker Hiring Credit. The JobMaker Hiring  Credit will be paid to your employer.

I have been receiving an eligible income  support payment and I am aged 16 to 35  years old - will every organisation be able  to receive the JobMaker Hiring Credit if they  hire me?

Employers need to meet certain eligibility  criteria to receive the JobMaker Hiring Credit, so  not all employers are eligible. For example, the  employer needs to be able to demonstrate that  they have increased their overall employment to  receive this payment.

How much is the JobMaker Hiring Credit and  who pays it?

For eligible employers who hire eligible  employees aged 16 to 29 years old at the time  of employment, the JobMaker Hiring Credit is  $200 a week. For eligible employers who hire  eligible employees aged 30 to 35 years old at  the time of employment, the JobMaker Hiring  Credit is $100 a week.

The ATO will pay the JobMaker Hiring Credit to  your employer.

Will the JobMaker Hiring Credit impact my  income?

Employers need to pay employees in  accordance with the prevailing industrial  relations arrangements. There is no specific

link between the income your employer is  required to pay you and the payment the  employer receives through the JobMaker Hiring  Credit. However, to be an eligible employee for  the JobMaker Hiring Credit you need to have

worked for a minimum of 20 hours of paid work  per week averaged over the full weeks worked  in the reporting period for which the payment is  being claimed.

I am eligible now but turn 36 years old soon -  will I still be eligible to attract the JobMaker  Hiring Credit when I turn 36?

To be eligible, you need to be aged 16 to 35  years old at the time you are hired by the  employer who wants to apply for the JobMaker  Hiring Credit. People aged 36 years or older at  the time of employment are ineligible for the

JobMaker Hiring Credit.

Employee eligibility

I am an eligible employee who has been  hired by an eligible employer - what do I  need to do?

Your employer will ask you to fill out a  nomination form where you need to declare  that you meet the employee eligibility for the  JobMaker Hiring Credit - that is, at the time of  hiring you:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ were aged 16 to 35 years old;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ had been receiving JobSeeker Payment, Youth  Allowance (Other) or Parenting Payment for  at least one of the three previous months;  and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ have not filled in a JobMaker Hiring Credit  nomination form for another employer who  you are still working for.

How much will I receive from the JobMaker  Hiring Credit?

The ATO will pay the JobMaker Hiring Credit  to your employer to subsidise their cost  of employing you. You will not receive the  JobMaker Hiring Credit in your own salary,  wages or other payment.

Employers need to pay you in accordance with  the prevailing industrial relations arrangements.  There is no specific link between the income  your employer is required to pay you and the

payment the employer receives through the  JobMaker Hiring Credit. However, to attract  the JobMaker Hiring Credit you need to have  worked for a minimum of 20 hours of paid work  per week averaged over the full weeks worked  in the reporting period for which the payment is  being claimed.

How many hours do I need to work to attract  the JobMaker Hiring Credit?

You need to work at least 20 hours a week  on average for the full weeks worked in the  reporting period for your employer to be able  to claim the JobMaker Hiring Credit. All paid  hours, including paid leave, count towards your  average hours, but unpaid leave does not count.

What happens if I work less than 20 hours  per week on average in a reporting period,   but more in the next reporting period?

Your employer will not be able to claim the  JobMaker Hiring Credit for the reporting  period where you did not work on average  20 paid hours per week but your employer

may be able to claim the credit in the following  reporting period, subject to other eligibility  criteria.

I nominated to receive the JobMaker Hiring  Credit through one employer. Can I get a  second job?

Yes, you can have two (or more) jobs. However,  you can only complete a nomination for the  JobMaker Hiring Credit for one employer at  any point in time, as two employers cannot be  receiving the hiring credit for you at the same  time.

I am on or have recently received one of  the eligible income support payments and  already have a job. Can I get another job and  be an eligible employee for the JobMaker  Hiring Credit?

Yes, as long as you meet the criteria by being  aged between 16 and 35 years old and receiving  the JobSeeker Payment, Youth Allowance  (Other) or Parenting Payment for at least one of  the previous three months before you are hired.  You do not have to quit your first job, as you can

have more than one job (as long as only one  employer is receiving the JobMaker Hiring Credit  for you at any point in time). The ability to be an  eligible employee for the JobMaker Hiring Credit

may make you more likely to gain additional  employment as your employer can claim the  hiring credit in respect of your employment  with them.

I am an independent contractor - can an  organisation I signed a contract to provide  services to claim the JobMaker Hiring Credit  for me?

No. You will need to be a permanent employee,  a casual or an employee on a fixed term  contract.

The JobMaker  Hiring Credit will  contain robust  integrity features

Integrity

What measures will ensure the integrity of  the JobMaker Hiring Credit?

The JobMaker Hiring Credit will be paid by the  Australian Taxation Office (ATO). The JobMaker  Hiring Credit will contain robust integrity  features that operate in a similar manner to the

JobKeeper Payment drawing on the existing  regulatory and enforcement infrastructure  of the tax law. In addition to the existing  administrative and civil penalties and criminal  offences that apply in the taxation law, integrity  features range from the eligibility requirements  for employers and employees to specific rules  to address contrived schemes and fraud.

These measures will not affect taxpayers that  do the right thing, but will allow for swift and  effective action to be taken against those that  seek to abuse the scheme and obtain more than  their entitlements.

Employers will need to satisfy a number of  conditions to qualify as an eligible employer.  These conditions will help ensure that the  employers in receipt of the JobMaker Hiring

Credit are carrying out genuine business

activities in Australia. An eligible employer must  hold an ABN, be up to date with tax lodgement  obligations, be registered for PAYG withholding  and be reporting employee payroll information  to the ATO through STP.

Employees will also need to satisfy a number  of conditions to help ensure they are entering  into a genuine employment relationship. For  example, ‘non-arms length’ employees will not  be considered eligible employees. This includes  family members of a family business, directors  of a company and shareholders of a company.
