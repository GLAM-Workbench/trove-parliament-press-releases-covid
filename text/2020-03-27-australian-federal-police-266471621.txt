A 35 year old American man has been arrested and charged in the US over alleged child



sex and exploitation material offences after police from the Australian Centre to Counter



Child Exploitation (ACCCE) identified and tracked the man online.



The ACCCE notified Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) after its Covert Online



Engagement Team (COET) identified a user from an internet forum based in America



allegedly producing and uploading a series of explicit images depicting a young female



child.



Homeland Security Investigations officers rescued the child victim and arrested the



accused at his home in Rushville, Indiana on Friday 27 March, 2020 (AEST).



In a separate investigation, the ACCCE COET infiltrated a child sex offender network



operating in the dark net that resulted in the interception of 3500 images and video files



depicting the sexual exploitation of children.



The material was immediately reviewed by the ACCCE Victim Identification Team,



resulting in the detection of 60 previously unidentified child victims and the addition of



content to 66 separate cases that are being investigated by the global law enforcement



community.



Australian Federal Police (AFP) Acting Commander ACCCE and Child Protection Paula



Hudson said these investigations were another example of Australian law enforcement’s



dedication to working alongside its international law enforcement partners to protect



children, and ensure those suspected of producing child abuse material were detected



and prosecuted.



“The consumption, production and dissemination of child abuse material has horrific



lifelong impacts on its victims,” she said.



“Our commitment to these investigations will not cease despite the challenging



circumstances we may face here in Australia and across the globe due to the COVID-19



outbreak. The AFP, together with our state and international partners will continue to



work tirelessly to protect the most vulnerable in our community - our children.”



“Anyone involved in the consumption, production and dissemination of child abuse



material, whether it is in Australia or abroad, be warned, we will find you and you will



face severe penalties.”



“This has come at critical time,” said Adam Parks, the HSI AttachÃÂ© to Australia.

“More so than ever, children are online for their schooling, to socialise with their friends



and family, and to play games.  Let this be a warning that law enforcement is undeterred



by COVID-19 and remains on-duty to keep our children safe in Australia, the U.S., and



online.”



Members of the public who have any information about people involved in the



possession or sharing of child exploitation material are urged to call Crime Stoppers on



1800 333 000.

Note to Media:



CHILD ABUSE MATERIAL, NOT ‘CHILD PORNOGRAPHY’



Use of the phrase ‘child pornography’ actually benefits child sex abusers:



It indicates legitimacy and compliance on the part of the victim, and therefore legality on the



part of the abuser;



It conjures up images of children posing in ‘provocative’ positions, rather than suffering



horrific abuse.



Every photograph captures an actual situation where a child has been abused.  This is not



pornography.
