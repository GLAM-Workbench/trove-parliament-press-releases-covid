INTERNATIONAL PREGNANCY AND INFANT LOSS REMEMBRANCE DAY

2020



Today is International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day - a day for parents,

families and friends to memorialise babies lost through miscarriage, stillbirth and infant

death.



In 2018, 2,419 lives were lost due to stillbirth or newborn death and it is estimated that one

in four pregnancies result in miscarriage - that is 103,000 every year.



Today is a day to honour those babies who lose their lives each year as well as a time for

their families to grieve.



Pregnancy loss is a devastating tragedy for thousands of Australian families which leads to

ongoing heartache and grievance - grief that takes place in homes, behind closed doors,

and is often solitary.



This grief has been made more difficult by the COVID pandemic with families separated

due to social distancing requirements and people removed from their usual support

networks.



Labor pays tribute to the parents and families who have been unable to bring their babies

home from hospital, or who have experienced miscarriage, stillbirth, or the death of a baby

shortly after birth.



This year, landmarks around Australia will be lit up in pink and blue to show Australian

families that they are not alone in their grief and that support is out there.



Since last yearâ€™s day of remembrance, Australia has made some progress in its ability to

provide crucial support to those impacted by pregnancy and infant loss.



These changes include the introduction of legislation to equalise unpaid parental leave

entitlements for all parents, including those of stillborn babies, as well as the

announcement to streamline support payments for bereaved families.



At the same time as supporting those who have suffered such a loss, we must continue all

possible efforts to reduce the rate of pregnancy and infant loss.



The scale of this tragedy must spur Australia into a concerted effort - including support for

those impacted by the higher rates of pregnancy loss and infant death, such as Aboriginal

and Torres Strait Islanders and those in our remote communities.



Labor remains committed to elevating the prominence and priority of reducing pregnancy

and infant loss as we continue to support Australian families, friends and loved ones who

have endured this incomparable grief.
