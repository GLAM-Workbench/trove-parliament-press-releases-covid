Prime Minister and Cabinet must show leadership and urgently ensure  that aged care around Australia is prepared

Questions to Prime Minster and Cabinet today at the COVID hearing have  shown that despite the aged care crisis the Government is not doing enough to  ensure that all aged care providers around Australia are completely prepared.

"It’s pretty obvious that prevention is better than cure and after speaking to the  Department today I have very little confidence that they are taking an  appropriate leadership role.

"We cannot just wait around, rely on self assessment by providers on their  readiness for an outbreak, there needs to be action around the country.

"It’s gobsmacking that the Department is not more concerned about this when  we see the crisis in Victoria and that they are not swiftly acting to ensure such  outbreaks don’t happen in other states.

"Australians are sick of the blame game, they are sick of the buck passing.

"It’s time for the Federal Government to take responsibility and take a  leadership role in coordinating and preventing future failures. The very bare  minimum is ensuring that each facility has as much PPE on hand as they need,  that all staff have undertaken face to face training on infectious disease control  and to ensure that the number of nurses and carers for each facility are  increased to ensure the recommended amount of care needed.

"Last time I questioned the Health Department we learned that only about half  of all aged care workers had done online infection control training.  It’s not good  enough."
