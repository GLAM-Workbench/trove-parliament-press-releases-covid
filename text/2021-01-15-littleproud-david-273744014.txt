Dan Andrews continues to ignore   Victorian farm worker shortage

The Victorian Premier’s push to re-open Australia to international university students when  it has yet to bring in a single seasonal worker shows how misplaced his priorities are.

Minister for Agriculture, David Littleproud, said that Dan Andrews is yet to approve bringing  in some of the 25,000 pre-vetted Pacific seasonal workers to help address the chronic  farm worker shortage despite industry and Commonwealth pleas.

“In October last year, the Australian Fresh Produce Alliance presented the Andrews  Government with a quarantine plan developed by Aspen Medical however so far Dan  Andrews has failed to respond to the plan or discuss any alternative options with industry,”  Minister Littleproud said.

“Health Minister Greg Hunt has also reassured the Victorian Government that we support  the Aspen Medical proposal and that we stand ready to stamp the visas.

“Dan Andrews has already done a special deal for tennis players from COVID hot spots  and now wants a special deal to bring in international students, but he is stubbornly  refusing to help his own farmers.

“Since we re-opened the Pacific and Seasonal labour schemes in August last year,  farmers in Western Australia, New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland and the Northern  Territory have safely recruited over 2,000 workers yet Victoria is yet to even develop a  quarantine protocol.

“The time for excuses is over. Victorian farmers deserve to be given the same access to  workers as their interstate counterparts.

“If Dan Andrews doesn’t act soon, all Australians will feel the pain through massive crop  losses and higher grocery prices.”
