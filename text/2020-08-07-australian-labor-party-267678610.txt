SOCIAL HOUSING CAN BE A STEP TOWARD MENTAL HEALTH REFORM

Secure housing is fundamental to improving mental health.

The Morrison Government cannot deny the link between secure housing and better mental  health outcomes for Australians.

The Productivity Commissionâ€™s draft report into mental health, released last October,  highlighted the importance of non-health services, including housing, in preventing mental  ill health and improving recovery.

Organisations such as Wesley Mission and the NSW Mental Health Coordinating Council  have reported the desperate need for adequate housing as the COVID-19 pandemic has  increased the number of people at risk of mental ill health and homelessness.

For months, Labor has been calling on the Morrison Government to fund the construction  of more social housing.

This would be a win-win.  It would provide work for thousands of tradies and put a roof over  the head of Australians who desperately need it.
