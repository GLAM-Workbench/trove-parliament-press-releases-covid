ADVANCES TO THE FINANCE MINISTER   IN THE WEEK ENDING FRIDAY 27 NOVEMBER 2020



This week I released $231.4 million in additional funding to support the Governmentâ€™s  response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to support grant payments to not-for-profit  organisations by using the Advance to the Finance Minister (the AFM).

The first determination provided $71.7 million to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport,  Regional Development and Communications to support the domestic aviation network.

This decision ensures continued funding for the Domestic Aviation Network Support  program, consistent with previous announcements by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister  for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, Michael McCormack.

The second determination provided $159.7 million to the Department of Social Services for  targeted services and assistance to families and communities.

This decision ensures operational continuity of support to not-for-profit organisations over  the Christmas period by providing funding for grant payments due in early December 2020,  before the Annual Appropriation Acts for 2020-21 receive Royal Assent and come into force.

Both determinations were made from the AFM that was appropriated by the Parliament in  Supply Act (No. 1) 2020-2021.

The determinations were signed on 25 and 26 November 2020 respectively. Both  determinations were registered on the Federal Register of Legislation, together with  Explanatory Statements (these are available at legislation.gov.au ).
