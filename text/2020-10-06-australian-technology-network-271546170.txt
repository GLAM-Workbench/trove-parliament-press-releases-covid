6 October 2020



New critical investments announced in the 2020-21 Federal Budget put universities at



the centre of Australia’s national economic recovery effort.



The Australian Technology Network of Universities (ATN), Australia’s most innovative



and enterprising universities, welcomes the range of measures announced in this year’s



Budget that start the journey to Australia’s post-pandemic recovery.



A record $1 billion in funding for university research in 2020-21, will underpin



Australia’s best and brightest talent while reinforcing key industries like advanced



manufacturing, space and defence, and provides much needed certainty to a sector that



supports many Australian jobs and generates many more.



Young Australians and disrupted workers will also benefit from the 50,000 short



courses and the additional 12,000 university places funded in the Budget. ATN



Universities are already working in partnership with industry and the Government to



deliver upskilling and retraining opportunities for workers disrupted by COVID-19.



ATN supports the measures within the budget aimed at assisting small to medium



enterprises (SMEs) in Australia’s post-pandemic recovery. ATN has always said that



SMEs are integral in Australia’s economy and they will be a driving force in our



recovery.



Quotes attributable to ATN Executive Director Luke Sheehy



:



“Australia’s universities are ready to play our critical role in supporting Australia’s



national economic recovery.



“Our research effort is critical in finding ways to work through the global pandemic, and



support workers and businesses.



“The Morrison Government have put universities at the centre of their plans for



recovery and we stand ready to do our part”.
