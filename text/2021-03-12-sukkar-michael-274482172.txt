HOUSING CONFIDENCE BUILT ON HOMEBUILDER

Today’s Housing Industry Association (HIA) New Home Sales Report for February 2021 again  underscores the significant impact HomeBuilder has had in driving confidence and demand in the  residential construction sector.

The Report showed new home sales rose 60.5 per cent in the three months to February 2021,  compared to the same three months the previous year.

Thanks to HomeBuilder, Australia’s tradies can look ahead and plan with confidence in 2021. HIA’s  economist Angela Lillicrap said today;

“This strong result reflects the significant impact of HomeBuilder on demand for detached housing.”

“HomeBuilder was the catalyst for improving consumer confidence in the housing market.”

HomeBuilder has delivered a secure pipeline of construction work that will keep hundreds of  thousands of tradies in work who would have otherwise been facing the unemployment queue.

The extension of HomeBuilder until 31 March 2021 also ensures there will be a steady pipeline of  construction activity through to 2022 to lock in this momentum for the construction sector.

Every new home sale represents more work for our tradies and helps build our comeback from the  COVID-19 recession.
