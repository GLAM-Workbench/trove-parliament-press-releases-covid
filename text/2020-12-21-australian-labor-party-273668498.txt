REPORT INTO COVID-19 OUTBREAKS AT ST BASIL’S AND EPPING GARDENS



The report into COVID-19 outbreaks at St Basil’s and Epping Gardens released today  confirms the Morrison Government’s tragic failure to keep older Australians in aged care  safe.

The litany of failings identified across the two facilities reflect the Aged Care Royal  Commission’s finding that the Morrison Government did not have a plan for COVID-19  in aged care.

685 older Australians have died from COVID-19 in aged care homes. 83 residents died  at St Basil’s and Epping Gardens alone.

The Morrison Government’s failings are heartbreaking and completely unforgiveable.

What’s worse - the Morrison Government learnt nothing from outbreaks of COVID-19 in  NSW aged care homes.

Despite reviews into outbreaks of COVID-19 in NSW aged care homes finding serious  issues with the Morrison Government’s ‘surge workforce’, it is clear the strategy was  also a disaster in Victorian aged care homes.

Today’s report notes that infection prevention and control was a significant issue across  both facilities but on the eve of outbreaks in Victorian aged care homes just 1 in 5 aged  care workers had completed the Morrison Government’s training modules on how to  use PPE.

The same communications issues that were previously identified in NSW outbreaks of  COVID-19 in aged care sadly repeated at St Basil’s and Epping Gardens.

This could have been avoided if the Morrison Government had a proper plan for  COVID-19 in aged care and learnt from previous mistakes.

Day after day, the evidence mounts of serious neglect in aged care and all we see from

the Morrison Government is running away, passing the buck and not accepting  responsibility for its own failures.

Just last week Scott Morrison let Richard Colbeck keep his Ministerial job while  retaining responsibility for aged care.

The Morrison Government received this important report in late November but didn’t  bother to release until today.

Neglect. That’s the legacy of this Government when it comes to aged care.

Australians deserve better.
