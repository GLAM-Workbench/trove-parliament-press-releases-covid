Wage subsidy gives security to business and workers



The Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management David Littleproud has  welcomed the decision by the government to provide subsidies to Australian businesses to  keep our nation’s workers employed.

Minister Littleproud said this job keeper payment will protect lives and livelihoods at a time  of crisis.

“In particular, it will give great comfort to those in regional and rural Australia where  businesses have been hit hard and their workers are worried about their future.

“Those that earn their crust in the agricultural sector will have security in knowing that the  Government has their employers’ back.

“Local ag supply stores that have experienced a 30 per cent business downturn will be  eligible for the wage subsidy.

“Wineries that have lost out because of the big tourism drop-off will be able to keep their  workers on.

“We will emerge from this crisis unified and stronger as a result of the security this  announcement will give employees and employers.

“The $130 billion package spread over the next 6 months is being committed to keep  Australian businesses ticking over and keep money in their workers’ wallets.

“Those eligible businesses can back date their claims to the 1st March 2020.

“The Federal Government will remain calm in this COVID-19 crisis and continue to build  that bridge to recovery.”
