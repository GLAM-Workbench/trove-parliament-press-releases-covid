Greens welcome announcement that Royal Commission will issue a special

report on response to COVID-19 in aged care

The Greens welcome the announcement  that the Royal Commission into Aged Care

Quality and Safety will issue a special report on the COVID-19 pandemic in aged care

ahead of its Final Report

“It is very clear that action is needed now to address the failures in the system that has

lead to the terrible impact COVID is having and its continuing potential to severely

impact aged care residents. We cannot wait until the final report of the Commission is

handed down early next year”, Greens spokesperson on Ageing Senator Rachel

Siewert said.

The Government should never have used the ‘wait for the Royal Commission’ excuse

before taking the urgent action that is needed, they do not have any excuse not to act

now.

Aged Care is a Federal responsibility and they need to act urgently to clean up the

mess they have created and protect older Australians and give their families peace of

mind.
