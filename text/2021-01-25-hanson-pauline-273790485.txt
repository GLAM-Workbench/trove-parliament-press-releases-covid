SENATOR HANSON CAUTIONS AGAINST VACCINE CELEBRATIONS

Media Release

Senator Pauline Hanson described today’s provisional approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for use in Australia as “a step in the right direction but by no means a reason for wild celebrations”.

“This is only provisional approval,” she cautioned.

“I call on the Prime Minister to ensure there is no consideration given to the mandating of the COVID vaccine - especially at this early stage in the approvals process.

“Australia has an incredibly low caseload of COVID infections by any standard and that should mean we have the breathing space to properly evaluate the dangers and effectiveness of any vaccine without rushing to judgement.

“I’ve said all along that vaccination should be a matter of personal choice and that remains my position.

“By its own admission the TGA has a long way to go before we can all be satisfied the vaccine is safe for the overwhelming majority of Australians to use.

“Today’s provisional approval is on the basis of preliminary clinical data only and the TGA will now monitor the vaccine’s safety as it is rolled out. As Professor Skerrit said today the TGA’s job is by no means done.” Senator Hanson added.
