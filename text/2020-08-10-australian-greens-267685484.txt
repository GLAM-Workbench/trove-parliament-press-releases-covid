Government must show leadership and give young people hope for their future



The very distressing reports of the high numbers of young people experiencing stress,

anxiety and mental ill health highlight how important it is for the Government to show

leadership and have a plan for the future for young people.



"Young people are worried and stressed because their futures are so uncertain and the

Government should put in place measures to provide a degree of certainty for their

future", Greens spokesperson on mental health Senator Rachel Siewert said.



This will be a lost generation if we don’t put substantial measures in place ensuring they

have an income and a job. That is why we need a job and income guarantee.



We need mental health support and emergency measures during this crisis but these

are shorter term resorts we also need to offer a holistic approach that offers hope for

young people so that they can plan for their futures.



Economic insecurity alone can lead to negative mental health and young people are

being hit hard by the economic fallout of COVID-19.



Experts now fear years of debt and unemployment are ahead for the young. And it

wasn't like things were easy before. Young people are locked out of the housing market,

living in rental stress and getting by with only patchy, unreliable work.



Every economic downturn hits young people harder than the general population. And

after the Global Financial Crisis, young people never fully recovered. We have to learn

from these mistakes.



A jobs and income guarantee for young people is part of the Greens Recovery Plan -

this is essential for young peoples’ well-being.



We need to invest in the mental health of our young people and that means investing in

a plan for our future.
