COVID-19 and  the Australian  Government’s response Australians have experienced  a year like no other

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound  impact on Australia’s health system, community  and economy, as it has all around the world.

The Government has acted quickly and decisively  to address the consequences of COVID-19. As  a result, Australia has achieved some of the  best health and economic outcomes in the  world. However, the impacts of COVID-19 will  continue to be felt in the Australian economy  for years to come. The Australian community  also continues to feel the effects of COVID-19,  through disruption to their lives, education  and health. The global economic outlook  remains highly uncertain, with many countries  experiencing their worst downturns since the  Great Depression.

This is a once-in-a-century shock that requires  an unprecedented level of support across the  economy. The Government’s initial response to  the COVID-19 pandemic provided $299 billion in  overall support.

The Government’s economic response is  designed to support Australian households and  businesses through an exceptionally difficult  period. It has helped keep businesses in business  and Australians in jobs through the JobKeeper  Payment and Boosting Cash Flow for Employers,  and supported Australians in need with the  Coronavirus Supplement and $750 payments to  those on certain income support.

The Government’s response is now transitioning  to ensure the Australian economy recovers  strongly by targeting additional temporary

support measures to boost household incomes,  bring forward business and infrastructure  investment activity, and drive the unemployment  rate back down.

The Government is continuing to support those  sectors, regions and communities that face  significant challenges.

The Government’s response to the 2019-20  bushfire season is also supporting families,  farmers, business owners and communities to  recover.

The path to recovery  The Government’s Economic Recovery Plan for  Australia will rebuild our economy, create jobs  and secure Australia’s future.

The 2020-21 Budget commits further  response and recovery support, bringing the  Government's overall support to $507 billion,  including $257 billion in direct economic support.

The Government’s response continues to be  temporary and well-targeted, use existing  delivery mechanisms where possible, and  proportionate to the shock and its impact on the  economy.

Our economic recovery plan for Australia is  focused on growing the economy so Australia  can create jobs, increase economic resilience  and create a more competitive and income-generating economy.

Budget Overview   |   Budget 2020-21  5

Our plan is also reflected through the revised  Economic and Fiscal Strategy, firmly setting  our focus on driving the economic recovery to  strengthen the budget position in the near term,  then stabilising and reducing debt as a share of  the economy over the medium term.

Australians can be confident that the  Government will ensure that Australia emerges  from the COVID-19 recession in a strong position.

6 Budget 2020-21   |   Budget Overview

Budget at a glance The once-in-a-century COVID-19 pandemic has  fundamentally reshaped Australia’s economic and  fiscal outlook  At the 2019-20 MYEFO, the underlying cash balance  for 2020-21 was forecast to be a surplus of $6.1 billion  (0.3 per cent of GDP).

Since then, the Government has responded decisively  to the 2019-20 bushfires and COVID-19 pandemic.

The initial COVID-19 response totalled $299 billion,  including health measures, the JobKeeper Payment,  Boosting Cash Flow for Employers and the  Coronavirus Supplement. The $2 billion National  Bushfire Recovery Fund has supported families,  farmers, business owners and communities.

The 2020-21 Budget includes $98 billion in response  and recovery support, including $25 billion under the  COVID-19 Response Package and $74 billion under the  JobMaker Plan.

The underlying cash deficit in 2020-21 is expected  to be $213.7 billion (11.0 per cent of GDP). This is

expected to improve over the forward estimates to  $66.9 billion deficit (3.0 per cent of GDP) in 2023-24  and to a $49.5 billion deficit (1.6 per cent of GDP) by  the end of the medium term.

Gross debt is expected to be 44.8 per cent of GDP at  the end of 2020-21, increasing to 51.6 per cent of GDP  by the end of the forward estimates. Gross debt is  projected to stabilise at around 55 per cent of GDP in  the medium term.

Net debt is expected to be 36.1 per cent of GDP at  the end of 2020-21, peaking at 43.8 per cent of GDP  at the end of the forward estimates. Net debt is then  projected to fall to 39.6 per cent of GDP at the end of  the medium term.

Until a vaccine is developed and widely deployed,  significant uncertainty remains. Through this phase,  the Government will maintain flexibility to respond to  the circumstances as they evolve.

Revised Fiscal Strategy The Government’s previous fiscal strategy served  Australia well, ensuring we entered the COVID-19  pandemic from a position of strength

The Government returned the budget to  balance for the first time in 11 years in 2018-19,  with debt-to-GDP significantly lower than the  average of the G20 advanced economies. The  Government’s responsible fiscal management  meant it was well placed to provide an  unprecedented level of support to households  and businesses.

The Government’s revised Economic and Fiscal  Strategy recognises that economic growth and  job creation will be essential to repair the budget  and ensure a sustainable budget position over  time.

The Government’s strategy includes two phases  - a COVID-19 Economic Recovery Plan that  targets job creation; and a medium-term phase  focused on stabilising and then reducing debt as  a share of the economy.

During the economic recovery, the Government  will continue to use fiscal policy to support  demand and confidence to achieve a private  sector-led recovery that drives employment  and productivity. As the economic recovery  progresses, the budget position will also  strengthen.

Once the unemployment rate is comfortably  below 6 per cent and on a path toward previous  levels, the focus will shift towards stabilising and  then reducing debt as a share of GDP, while still  allowing for flexibility in response to changing  economic conditions.

The strategy maintains the Government’s  long-standing commitments to a low and  sustainable tax burden, the guaranteed  provision of essential services, and budget and  balance sheet discipline.

Global economic  outlook  The worst global economic crisis  since the Great Depression

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global  crisis like no other in living memory. With  countries taking action to protect the health of  citizens, most economies have recorded historic  contractions this year. Global growth is forecast  to fall by 4½ per cent in 2020.

Australia stands out among advanced economies  for its low infection rates and comparatively  strong economic outcomes.

Uncertainty about economic and health  outcomes has weighed on consumer and  business confidence, and has put pressure on  the global economic and financial architecture.  Physical distancing and restrictions introduced to  control the virus will constrain economic activity  for some time, and renewed outbreaks remain a  key risk to the outlook.

The pandemic has hit workers hard. According  to the International Labour Organization, hours  worked fell by the equivalent of 600 million  full-time jobs in the June quarter 2020,   compared to the December quarter 2019.

Governments and central banks have responded  to the crisis decisively. Fiscal support aimed at  stood down and laid-off workers has limited the  impact on household balance sheets, particularly  in advanced economies. Near-zero policy interest  rates and unconventional monetary policy  have helped central banks around the world to  maintain liquidity.

Global merchandise trade was 9 per cent lower  in the first half of 2020 than in the second half  of 2019. International travel restrictions have  disproportionately affected services trade, such  as tourism and education.

Major trading partner GDP is expected to fall  by 3 per cent in 2020, before growing by 5¾ per  cent in 2021. China’s economic performance is  important for Australia’s Major trading partner  growth as it accounts for over one-third of  Australia’s trade. With Chinese GDP expected  to grow this year, Australia’s external outlook  remains in a better position than many other  economies.

Domestic economic  outlook Economic recovery is underway

The Australian economy is currently in recession  as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, its first  recession in almost 30 years.

Real GDP fell by 7.0 per cent in the June quarter  2020 after a modest contraction of 0.3 per cent  in the March quarter, as travel restrictions and  other pandemic containment measures affected  the ability of consumers and businesses to  undertake their usual spending and investment  activities.

As the virus has come under control and  containment measures have been eased, the  jobs lost have started to come back. Of the  1.3 million people who lost their job or were  stood down on zero hours for economic reasons  in April, almost 60 per cent or 760,000 are now  back at work.

Economic activity is forecast to pick up strongly  from late 2020 and into early 2021, driven by a  further easing of containment measures and  improving business and consumer confidence.  Activity will also be significantly supported by  an unprecedented $257 billion in Government  economic support.

Real GDP is forecast to fall by 3¾ per cent in 2020  before recovering in 2021 to grow by 4¼ per cent.

The unemployment rate is expected to peak at  around 8 per cent in the December quarter of  this year, before falling over the next few years  as the economy recovers and businesses gain  confidence to employ more workers. By the  June quarter 2022, the unemployment rate is  expected to be 6½ per cent and will continue to  decline over the forecast period.

The Government’s economic support measures,  including the JobKeeper Payment, are reducing  the damage to the economy and the labour  market from the COVID-19 pandemic. Without  this support, GDP would have fallen further and  the unemployment rate would have been much  higher.

New initiatives in this Budget as part of the  Government’s economic recovery plan are  helping households and businesses to get back  on their feet.

The challenges for the Australian economy  from the virus remain significant. Further  outbreaks of the virus are likely until a vaccine  is developed and becomes widely available. Any  substantial outbreaks that affect the confidence  of households to spend and businesses to invest  and employ people remain a key risk to the  national recovery.

Almost 60 per cent  or 760,000 of the  1.3 million people who  lost their job or were stood

down on zero hours are  now back at work  —

12 Budget 2020-21   |   Budget Overview

Lower taxes for   hard-working  Australians More money in your pocket  and creating jobs In this Budget, the Government is delivering  an additional $17.8 billion in personal income  tax relief to support the economic recovery,  including an additional $12.5 billion over the  next 12 months. It builds on the $8.1 billion in  tax relief that will be delivered for the 2020-21  income year under the already legislated  Personal Income Tax Plan.

Under the Government's changes, individuals  will benefit from bringing forward the tax cuts in  Stage 2 of its Plan, as well as a one-off additional  benefit from the low- and middle-income tax  offset in 2020-21.

This will provide around 11.6 million  individuals with a tax cut in 2020-21,  compared with 2017-18 settings.

In 2020-21, low- and middle-income earners  will receive tax relief of up to $2,745 for  singles, and up to $5,490 for dual income  families, compared with 2017-18 settings.

The majority of the benefit for 2020-21 will   go to those on incomes below $90,000.

Treasury estimates that reducing the personal  income tax burden on hard-working Australians  will boost GDP by around $3.5 billion in 2020-21  and $9 billion in 2021-22 and will create an  additional 50,000 jobs by the end of 2021-22.

*The table provides stylised cameos based on the tax payable for an individual, excluding any transfer payments. The tax liability and tax relief are calculated only  taking into account the basic tax scales, low income tax offset, low and middle income tax offset and the Medicare levy (with 2017-18 Medicare levy single low-income  threshold). Actual outcomes for many individuals and households would differ.

Budget Overview   |   Budget 2020-21  13

Building on our Personal  Income Tax Plan By putting more money in their pockets, families  will keep more of what they earn, allowing them  to spend more on what they need.

This keeps businesses operating and ensures  employers can retain their staff. As sales  increase, this will improve business confidence  and encourage them to create more jobs and  invest. This grows our economy now and in the  future.

Lower taxes also give Australians the incentive to  work hard and get ahead, knowing that they can  keep more of their money.

The Government is committed to keeping  taxes low so that hard-working Australians are  rewarded for their effort and keep more for what  they need. When the Plan is fully implemented  in 2024-25, around 95 per cent of taxpayers  are expected to face a marginal tax rate of  30 per cent or less.

Supporting housing  construction Supporting first home buyers  As part of our economic recovery plan to create  jobs, rebuild our economy and secure Australia’s  future, an additional 10,000 first home buyers  will be able to purchase a new home sooner  under the extension to the First Home Loan  Deposit Scheme.

The additional 10,000 places will be provided in  2020-21 to support the purchase of a new home  or a newly built home. This will allow first home  buyers to secure a loan to build a new home or  purchase a newly built dwelling with a deposit  of as little as 5 per cent, with the Government  guaranteeing up to 15 per cent of a loan.

Our First Home Loan Deposit Scheme is already  helping almost 20,000 first home buyers  purchase a home this year with a deposit as   low as 5 per cent.

This measure will stimulate activity in housing  construction and is estimated to generate an  additional $800 million in economic activity.

The extension to the First Home Loan Deposit  Scheme complements the Government’s broader  suite of reforms to Australia’s lending laws which  will reduce the regulatory burden on lenders and  borrowers, boosting the flow of credit to  the economy.

Building more homes The Government is creating new opportunities  for Australian industry and boosting jobs by  supporting housing supply.

The Government will increase its guarantee of  the National Housing Finance and Investment  Corporation (NHFIC) by $1 billion, enabling  NHFIC to increase its bond issuance into the  wholesale capital market. This will attract  institutional investment into affordable housing  for Australians.

These measures build on the success of the  Government’s HomeBuilder program, which was  announced on 4 June. HomeBuilder provides  eligible owner-occupiers with a grant of $25,000  to build a new home or rebuild an existing home.

The Government recognises the residential  construction sector’s important role in the  Australian economy and its investment in  supporting new construction will help maintain  and support jobs in the construction industry.

Infrastructure  investment Infrastructure investment to  boost growth and jobs Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic   the Government has committed to invest an  additional $14 billion in new and accelerated  infrastructure projects over the next four years.  These projects will support a further 40,000 jobs  during their construction.

This investment is part of the Government’s  record 10-year transport infrastructure  investment pipeline, which has been expanded  to $110 billion and is already supporting 100,000  jobs on worksites across the country.

This investment pipeline includes projects  in every state and territory, as well as the  generation-defining Melbourne to Brisbane  Inland Rail and Western Sydney International  (Nancy-Bird Walton) Airport.

Fast-tracking shovel-ready  projects to create jobs The Government is providing an additional  $3 billion towards shovel-ready projects to  support further job creation and economic  recovery, building on the $2 billion announced  since May 2020.

This includes $2 billion to deliver small scale  road safety projects as well as an additional  $1 billion of funding for the Local Roads and  Community Infrastructure Program, on top of  the $500 million already announced. These   programs are expected to support over  10,000 jobs over the next two years.

Funding will be provided to state and local  governments on a "use it or lose it" basis, with  unused funding for road safety projects to be  reallocated to states and territories that have  successfully deployed their previous allocations.

This will help ensure projects are delivered  efficiently and the economic stimulus effects are  maximised.

Supporting business  and investment The Government is supporting  Australian businesses to invest,  grow and create more jobs

Business investment is vital to Australia’s  short-term economic recovery and longer term  productive capacity and wage growth.

Temporary full expensing To support new investment and increase  business cash flow, the Government is providing  a temporary tax incentive, which will be available  to around 3.5 million businesses (over 99 per cent  of businesses) that employ around 11.5 million  workers. The incentive will apply to around  $200 billion worth of investment, including  80 per cent of investment in depreciable assets  by non-mining businesses.

From 7:30pm (AEDT) on 6 October 2020 until  30 June 2022, businesses with turnover up to  $5 billion will be able to deduct the full cost of  eligible depreciable assets of any value in the  year they are installed. The cost of improvements  to existing eligible depreciable assets made  during this period can also be fully deducted.

Full expensing significantly reduces the  after-tax cost of eligible assets, providing a cash  flow benefit. It creates a strong incentive for  businesses to bring forward investment before  it expires. Full expensing builds on the enhanced  instant asset write-off and the accelerated  depreciation previously announced through the  Backing Business Investment incentive.

This measure is estimated to deliver $26.7 billion  in tax relief over the forward estimates, and  $3.2 billion over the medium term.

Temporary loss carry-back The Government will also allow companies with  turnover up to $5 billion to offset losses against  previous profits on which tax has been paid,  to generate a refund. Loss carry-back will be  available to around 1 million companies that  employ up to 8.8 million workers.

Losses incurred up to 2021-22 can be carried  back against profits made in or after 2018-19.  Eligible companies may elect to receive a tax  refund when they lodge their 2020-21 and  2021-22 tax returns.

This measure will provide further cash  flow support and promote investment by  encouraging more businesses to take advantage  of full expensing.

This measure is estimated to deliver $4.9 billion  in tax relief to businesses over the forward  estimates, and $3.9 billion over the medium  term.

Supporting Australia’s  economic recovery Treasury estimates that these two measures will  create around 50,000 jobs by the end of 2021-22,  and boost GDP by around $2.5 billion in 2020-21  and $10 billion in 2021-22.

Budget Overview   |   Budget 2020-21  19

Modernising Australia’s tax  treaty network  The Government will support the recovery from  COVID-19 by modernising and expanding our  tax treaty network to eliminate double taxation,  settling taxing rights between countries and  attracting foreign investment and skilled  workers.

FBT retraining The Government is exempting from the  47 per cent fringe benefits tax (FBT)  employer-provided retraining activities to  employees who are redeployed to a different role  in the business. This will encourage employers to  help redeployed workers transition to a new role  within or outside the business.

Small business tax  concessions Around 20,000 small to medium businesses will  access up to ten small business tax concessions  for the first time, providing tax relief and  reducing red tape so they can get on with  running their business.

This builds on other Government measures  including the cut to the tax rate to 25 per cent  for companies with a turnover of less than  $50 million that has been legislated and fast  tracked by five years.

Fred's Medical Services Pty Ltd has  an aggregated annual turnover of  $200 million for the 2021-22 income  year. Fred's business engages Shane's  Software Pty Ltd to create new software  to create a new medical database for  $400,000, exclusive of GST. The in house  software is first installed and used on  1 July 2021.

Under the depreciation arrangements in  current law, Fred's business would claim  a total tax deduction of $80,000 for the  2021-22 income year, with the remainder  of the cost being depreciated over future  years.

Under temporary full expensing, Fred's  business will instead claim a deduction of  $400,000 for the full cost of the software  in 2021-22, which is $320,000 more than  before. Fred's business will pay $96,000  less tax in 2021-22. This will improve the  company's cash flow and help Fred's  business invest and grow.

Increased demand due to temporary full  expensing from customers such as Fred's  business also helps Shane's Software Pty  Ltd to grow, enabling Shane to hire more  staff.

A digital Australia The Government is enabling  businesses to take advantage of  digital technologies to help grow their  businesses and create jobs

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the  adoption of digital technologies by Australian  businesses and consumers which has enabled  many to transform their operations and continue  to trade through the crisis.

The Government’s Digital Business Plan will  build on this momentum to support an even  greater adoption of new technologies across the  economy - by both businesses and consumers.

It will support our goal for Australia to be a  leading digital economy by 2030. An additional  $4.5 billion investment in NBN Co will bring  ultra-fast broadband to millions of families and  businesses. Funding of $29.2 million will also  accelerate the rollout of the 5G network.

The Government will continue to invest in  establishing secure and convenient Digital  Identity arrangements to enable users to  verify their identity online when dealing with  government and, in future, the private sector.

Reforms will make permanent the measures  enabling companies to hold virtual Annual  General Meetings to engage with their  shareholders and e-signatures to more  efficiently transact with others.

The Government will expand its commitment  to providing consumers and businesses with  greater control over their own data through the  continued rollout of the Consumer Data Right for  Open Banking and for the energy sector.

Australian businesses and consumers expect  digital services from Commonwealth agencies  on par with the private sector.  Commonwealth  agencies will be able to receive e-invoices from  their private sector suppliers. Our business  registries will be modernised, improving  the ease, cost and choices available for the  establishment and maintenance of businesses.

Budget Overview   |   Budget 2020-21  21

The Government will provide $24.7 million to  help small business operators use technology,  including providing an additional 10,000 places  for the Australian Small Business Advisory  Service - Digital Solutions program. We will also  improve access by businesses and workers to  digital skills training.

There will be a comprehensive review of the  regulatory architecture of the payments  system to ensure that it is well placed to foster  innovation and competition that lowers business  costs and enhances consumer choice.

Support will be increased through Austrade for  our fintech sector to expand exports of financial  services and foster inward investment. This  support will assist in the growth of Australia’s  fintech sector which will complement the roll out  of the Consumer Data Right in banking.

Improving the ease   of doing business Cutting red tape is a key element   of the Government’s Economic  Recovery Plan

Cutting red tape is a key element of the  Government’s Economic Recovery Plan for  Australia.

The Government has already delivered  $5.8 billion of red-tape savings through the  ‘Cutting Red Tape’ initiative.

That is why the Government is making it easier  for businesses to invest, create jobs, respond  quickly to challenges and seize opportunities.

In this Budget, the Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ streamline and digitise a wide range of  regulatory processes;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ reduce regulation that imposes unnecessary  costs and hinders business activity; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ support small business through the recovery.

Dealing with Government regulation will be  simpler and faster, saving individuals and  businesses time and money.

Boosting exports Cutting red tape on Australia’s exports

Boosting exports is vital to creating jobs across  Australia. The Government is removing barriers  to exports and making it easier for Australian  businesses to access international markets.

Facilitating agricultural  exports The Government is investing $328 million to  turbocharge agricultural exports and help  farmers recover from drought, bushfires and  COVID-19.

The Government is slashing red tape by  delivering improved digital services for farmers.  It is providing $222 million to modernise digital  services for agricultural exporters, making it  cheaper and easier for farmers and exporters to  get their products to overseas markets.

The new platform will bring together different  systems so exporters can spend less time  filling in forms and more time growing their  businesses.

Farmers will also have access to up-to-date  information to help them make the most of  Australia’s free trade agreements.

The Government is also investing $35.2 million  to cut the regulatory burden on seafood, meat,  live animal and plant exporters. Sensible,  technology-based regulation will leave  businesses to focus on doing what they do best,  while safeguarding Australia’s reputation as a  premium producer of agricultural goods.

Trade Single Window As part of the Government’s $28.6 million  investment in the Simplified Trade System,  a Trade Single Window will play a key role  in busting congestion at the border. The  Government is providing $7.8 million to  continue simplifying Australia’s trade system  by overhauling outdated regulations and  streamlining compliance processes for  businesses.

By modernising border systems the Government  is driving down costs for traders, improving  Australia’s global competitiveness and creating  local jobs.

Greg, a grapefruit grower from Mildura,  has been working hard to build his  business and is now thinking about  breaking into export markets.

Currently, Greg would need to submit  up to 20 forms and certificates across  multiple different emails, websites and  databases.

With the Government’s investment in  this Budget, Greg will only need to sign  in to one system, where he could also get  up-to-date information on new market  opportunities, such as those available  under Australia’s free trade agreements.

JobMaker  Hiring Credit The Government’s new JobMaker Hiring Credit  will help to accelerate growth in employment  during the recovery by giving businesses  incentives to take on additional employees that  are young job seekers aged 16 to 35 years old.  The JobMaker Hiring Credit is a key part of the  Government’s JobMaker Plan to boost Australia’s  economic recovery.

Job losses have been extensive during the  COVID-19 pandemic and young people have  been particularly hard hit. Through the JobMaker  Hiring Credit, the Government will help young  people access job opportunities and rebuild their  connection to the labour force as the economy  recovers.

The JobMaker Hiring Credit is estimated to  support around 450,000 positions for young  people and cost $4 billion from 2020-21 to  2022-23.

The JobMaker Hiring Credit will be available to  employers from 7 October 2020 for each new job  they create over the next 12 months for which

they hire an eligible young person. For each  eligible employee, employers will receive for up  to 12 months:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $200 a week if they hire an eligible young  person aged 16 to 29 years; or

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $100 a week if they hire an eligible young  person aged 30 to 35 years.

Eligible young job seekers will have received  JobSeeker Payment, Youth Allowance (Other)  or Parenting Payment for at least one of the  previous three months at the time of hiring.  Employers must demonstrate that they  have increased their overall employment to  receive this payment for up to 12 months for  each position created. To claim the JobMaker  Hiring Credit, employers need to report their  employees’ payroll information to the Australian  Taxation Office through Single Touch Payroll.

The JobMaker  Hiring Credit will  support 450,000 young  people to get into work

and will improve their  economic, health and  social outcomes  —

Investing in   education, skills   and apprenticeships JobTrainer - growing  Australia’s skills workforce The Government is making skills development  a high priority as part of its JobMaker Plan. The  Government’s commitment will support getting  people into jobs and ensures that Australians  have the right skills for the jobs of the future.

The Government’s JobMaker Plan includes  the establishment of the $1 billion JobTrainer  Fund, with funding matched between the  Commonwealth and state and territory  governments. The Fund will support up to  340,700 additional free or low-fee training  places in areas of genuine need to help upskill  and retrain job seekers and young people,  including school leavers.

New apprenticeships   to help the recovery The Government has a plan to upskill and reskill  Australians into jobs and to deliver the pipeline  of skills needed for the economic recovery.

In addition to the $2.8 billion Supporting  Apprentices and Trainees Wage Subsidy that  supports existing apprentices and trainees  through to 31 March 2021, the Government is  investing a further $1.2 billion in Australia’s  skills pipeline and boosting the number of new  apprenticeships and traineeships.

The Boosting Apprenticeships Wage Subsidy  will support up to 100,000 new apprentices  and trainees by paying a 50 per cent wage  subsidy, up to a cap of $7,000 per quarter,  for commencing apprentices and trainees at  businesses of all sizes, in all industries, and in all  locations.

Supporting job seekers  The Government is also implementing a range  of measures to help connect job seekers to  employment and training opportunities. This  includes $296 million to deliver a new Digital  Employment Services platform, $183 million  to provide individualised support to online job  seekers, and $21.9 million to assist young people  to access specialised support more quickly.

More job-ready graduates  The Government is supporting school leavers  and displaced workers by creating additional  undergraduate places to help Australia’s  COVID-19 recovery.

Demand for bachelor places is expected to  significantly increase in 2021 due to the COVID-19  pandemic. The Government is enabling around  17,000 additional places in 2021, as part of  the growth in undergraduate places from the  Job-ready Graduates Package. To complement  this growth in undergraduate places, the  Government is investing a further $299 million to  provide an additional 12,000 undergraduate  places in 2021.

Short courses to reskill   and upskill Australians The Government is providing opportunities  for students and the recently unemployed to  retrain in areas of high demand and national  priority by supporting the delivery of 50,000

higher education short courses. Short online  courses including in teaching, health, science,  information technology and agriculture will  provide faster training pathways and alternative  study options for workers looking to upskill.

Helping young Australians  through COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in  unprecedented disruption to teaching and  learning for school children. To support  these students, the Government is investing  $146 million in a range of programs to improve  the educational outcomes of disadvantaged  students and school leavers.

This is on top of the Government’s record  spending on school funding, which has increased  from $13.8 billion in 2014 to $21.8 billion in 2020,  and will grow to $34 billion in 2030.

This includes employment programs to support  women’s leadership and development, and  increase opportunities for women in science,  technology, engineering and mathematics  (STEM), business and male-dominated industries.

The $50 million Women@Work Plan will expand  the Women’s Leadership and Development  Program grants and establish a Respect@Work  Council to address sexual harassment at work.  This builds on the Government’s commitment to  support women’s safety at work and at home.

The Government is providing an additional  $35.9 million to expand the Boosting Female  Founders initiative to provide women  entrepreneurs access to expert mentoring and  business advice.

The Government is providing $25.1 million  to assist 500 women through STEM Industry  Cadetships or Advanced Apprenticeships. The  Government is expanding the Women in STEM  and Entrepreneurship (WISE) Grants. The  program will fund projects led by business,  industry and the community which focus on  increasing girls’ and women’s participation   in STEM.

The Government is increasing access to the Girls  in STEM Toolkit. The Toolkit is a valuable online  resource for students, parents and teachers  which helps girls match their interests to careers  in STEM and prepares them to engage in the  STEM jobs of the future.

Supporting  manufacturing   and research   and development Modern Manufacturing  Strategy The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a light on the  critical importance of supply chains and having a  flexible, adaptable and innovative manufacturing  capability.

The Government’s Modern Manufacturing  Strategy is a long-term plan to support  Australia’s economic recovery, deliver higher  value jobs and improve the competitiveness  of our manufacturing sector. It will build scale  in areas where Australia has the capability  to compete with the rest of the world. This  includes our defence, space, food and beverages,  recycling and clean energy, medical products,  resource technologies and critical minerals  processing industries.

To support the Strategy, the Government is  investing $1.3 billion through the Modern  Manufacturing Initiative. With this funding, the  Government will co-invest with our world-leading  manufacturers to help them achieve scale,  commercialise our world-leading research, and  connect to international markets.

The Government is investing $107 million  through the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative to  identify and address supply chain vulnerabilities  for key products, building our resilience for the  future.

The Government is also helping small  and medium manufacturers by providing  $52.8 million for a second round of the  Manufacturing Modernisation Fund. This will  help manufacturers scale-up, invest in new  technologies, create and maintain jobs and  upskill their workers.

A further $50 million is being provided to  Industry Growth Centres to deliver immediate  support to our manufacturing priority industries.

Supporting research and  development The Government is investing an additional  $2 billion through the Research and  Development Tax Incentive.

For small claimants (turnover less than  $20 million), the Government will increase the  refundable R&D tax offset and there will be no  cap on annual cash refunds. For larger claimants,  the intensity test will be streamlined and the  non-refundable R&D tax offset will be increased.  The cap on eligible R&D expenditure will be lifted  from $100 million to $150 million per annum.

These changes apply from 1 July 2021 and will  support more than 11,400 companies that claim  the incentive.

Energy security and  market reforms  Securing electricity supply  and lower prices Nationally, household electricity prices have  fallen by 4.7 per cent since December 2018, with  wholesale electricity prices decreasing over the  past 12 months. To maintain lower prices, the  Government will work with private providers to  increase dispatchable generation capacity and  the National Cabinet to ensure an efficient and  integrated system.

The Government will work with the states,  through a program worth up to $250 million,  to accelerate three important electricity  transmission projects - the Marinus Link, Project  Energy Connect and VNI West. These projects  will reduce prices and create over 4,000 jobs.

Technologies and   jobs of the future The Government released the first Low  Emissions Technology Statement, supported by  a $1.9 billion package, to accelerate technologies  that will deliver lower emissions, increase  investment, lower costs and create jobs to  support the economic recovery.

To help deliver this the Australian Renewable  Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance  Corporation will have their remits expanded to  enable them to back new technologies in sectors  like agriculture, manufacturing and transport.

Supporting   resilient regions Local approaches to drive the recovery

The Government continues to stand with  regional Australia who has withstood flood,  fire, drought and now, COVID-19. Through a  regional package of more than $550 million  the Government will support our regions to  recover from the impacts of COVID-19. This  builds on support provided through the $1 billion  COVID-19 Relief and Recovery Fund.

Regional tourism recovery The tourism sector is a key contributor to many  regional economies and employed more than  660,000 Australians pre-COVID-19, with 315,000  of these people in regional areas. With domestic  and international border closures having a  significant impact on the tourism sector, the  Government will invest over $250 million for a  Regional Tourism Recovery Package.

Regional communities will benefit from  $200 million in grants through the Building  Better Regions Fund with $100 million of the fund  earmarked for tourism-related infrastructure  projects that will boost regional tourism.

Tourism regions particularly hard hit by the  international border closures like Tropical North  Queensland and Tasmania will benefit from  $51 million over two years to attract domestic  visitors.

In addition, $100 million over two years will  go towards Regional Recovery Partnerships  to coordinate investments with other levels  of government and support recovery,  diversification and growth in ten regions  across Australia such as the Snowy Mountains,  Kangaroo Island, and the Hunter.

Boosting capacity on the  ground The Government is helping our rural workforce  by providing $50.3 million to expand the Rural  Health Multidisciplinary Training Program and  invest in increased training and infrastructure  for the rural health workforce. Capability on  the ground will also be improved through  $5.7 million in new support for Building Resilient  Regional leaders.

The Government is also establishing a $41 million  Research and Development Program that will  support activities directly benefitting regionally  based industries, including securing raw material  inputs for manufacturing in regional Australia.

Budget Overview   |   Budget 2020-21  33

Staying connected $30.3 million will be provided to improve  mobile and broadband services in regional  areas, through the extension of the Regional  Connectivity Program.

Investments by NBN Co will also assist small  and medium businesses across our regions,  providing faster network access for millions of  households. This includes a $300 million fund  to invest alongside governments and local  councils to improve broadband services for rural  and regional communities. Upgrading services  will stimulate regional and rural Australia with  remote work becoming increasingly common  across many occupations.

The Government continues to support our  aviation industry to maintain essential networks  and connect regions through the extension of  the Domestic Aviation Network Support and the  Regional Airline Network Support programs.

Supporting Australia’s  primary industries Like the tourism sector, Australia's primary  industries have faced unique challenges from the  COVID-19 pandemic after having borne the brunt  of the 2019-20 bushfires, severe floods and years  of drought.

The Government is making sure primary  producers can get their high-quality perishable  products into overseas markets while flights  remain limited. The Government is providing  an additional $317 million to the International  Freight Assistance Mechanism, which has already  supported $1.9 billion in Australian produce to  key export markets through existing supply  chains.

The Government is also providing an extra  $51 million in grants to help exporters meet the  costs of reaching new markets and growing their  businesses overseas.

The Government will spend $156 million  over four years to help farmers recover from  the current drought and prepare for future  droughts. This includes $19.6 million to extend  the National Drought and North Queensland  Flood Response and Recovery Agency for  another year. It will also provide a further  $2 billion in drought concessional loans.

The Government is also providing targeted  support to the fishing and forestry industries  through waiving $10 million of fees on Australia's  fishing industry, a $4 million information  campaign to encourage Australians to eat our  healthy, sustainable seafood and $25 million to  haul salvaged logs to timber mills that survived  the bushfires and for new timber storage  facilities to ensure fire affected trees do not go to  waste and can help secure our domestic timber  supply.

Supporting the agriculture  workforce The Government is helping ensure Australia's  farmers can find employees to pick their fruit  and harvest their crops. After years of drought,  Australian agriculture is on track for recovery,  but without a workforce boost, our farmers  and the regional communities that rely on them  won’t be able to benefit from the recent rains.

The Government will provide $17.4 million to  expand the Relocation Assistance to Take Up a  Job Program, including for those who temporarily  relocate to take up agriculture work. Temporary  changes are being made to the income support  system to encourage school leavers to undertake  work in the sector and additional flexibility has  been provided for temporary Visa holders to  help Australian farmers get their food and fibre  to market.

34 Budget 2020-21   |   Budget Overview

A more secure and  resilient Australia Securing Australia’s  water supply The Government is building water infrastructure  for the 21st Century helping to increase our  water security, build regional resilience,  deliver jobs and grow our critical agriculture  sector. The National Water Grid will help  secure reliable supplies of water for rural and  regional Australia now and into the future. An  investment of $2 billion for new projects under  the National Water Infrastructure Development  Fund will support the next generation of water  infrastructure through the Grid.

A further $50 million to build on-farm dams,  tanks and troughs will also help create jobs in  rural communities impacted by COVID-19. This  is on top of the Government’s $5 billion Future  Drought Fund, which is enhancing drought  resilience.

Murray-Darling Basin The Government’s $270 million Murray-Darling  Communities Investment Package will improve  the health of the Basin while supporting regional  development. The package includes $70.5 million  for projects that will accelerate implementation  of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It also  includes a $77.2 million investment to increase  confidence in the Basin Plan, including through  the establishment of a new Inspector-General of  Water Compliance.

Northern Australia  Infrastructure Facility To ensure that Northern Australia can continue  to benefit from infrastructure to support  essential services, the Government has extended  the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility  (NAIF) for an additional five years, to June 2026,  and expanded its lending criteria. The NAIF has  already invested more than $2 billion in projects  such as the development of a new gas pipeline  from Port Hedland to support premium fertiliser  production.

Protecting our  environment Recycling initiatives  The Government is banning the export of  waste plastic, paper, tyres and glass. This  will help protect our oceans while creating  jobs in the recycling industry. This ban will  stop 645,000 tonnes of waste ending up in  landfill each year, which is the equivalent of  400,000 cars.

The Government will invest $249.6 million over  four years to modernise recycling infrastructure,  reduce waste and recycle more within Australia.

This includes a $190 million Recycling  Modernisation Fund, which will invest in new  infrastructure to sort and recycle plastic,  paper, tyres and glass waste. This will stimulate  $600 million of investment in Australia’s recycling  industry.

Oceans The Government is investing $47.4 million to  protect our oceans and restore their health.   We will do this through our world-leading  management of marine protected areas and  through working with countries in our region,  including our Pacific family, to protect our  region's mangroves, tidal marshes, seagrasses  and coal reefs. The Government will also employ  more Indigenous rangers to clean up abandoned  ghost nets across northern Australia’s oceans.  This will help save marine life such as turtles and  dugongs.

Chemicals The Government is committing $29.1 million  to reduce the risk of chemical contamination  on Commonwealth land and tightening the  regulation of chemical use.

In this Budget, more  than $148 million in additional funding for mental  health support is being provided. All Australians  will be able to access up to 10 additional  Medicare rebated psychology sessions with the  support of their GP. Critical frontline services,  including headspace, Lifeline, Kids Helpline and  Beyond Blue, will receive additional funding.

This in addition to $48.1 million of funding  provided to support the National Mental Health  and Wellbeing Pandemic Response Plan.

Investing in primary health The Government is supporting Australia’s  primary care system, including over $750 million  in funding for COVID-19 testing and $171 million  for the extended operation of up to 150  dedicated respiratory clinics to manage and  diagnose COVID-19 cases.

These measures will ensure access to safe  assessment and testing for all Australians,  including in regional and remote communities.

Protecting older Australians  in aged care Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the  Government has provided $1.6 billion to ensure  the safety of older Australians in aged care.

In this Budget, the Government is providing  an additional $746.3 million to support senior  Australians in aged care, workers and providers  to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Supporting Australians  through the pandemic The Government is providing  unprecedented financial assistance   to Australians to support them  through the COVID-19 pandemic

JobKeeper Payment The JobKeeper Payment is one of the largest  fiscal and labour market interventions in  Australia’s history. It is estimated to cost  $101.3 billion over 2019-20 and 2020-21 and  is currently supporting around 3.5 million  individuals, in over 900,000 businesses.

The Government has extended the JobKeeper  Payment support for a further six months until  28 March 2021, with the Payment targeted  to those businesses that continue to be  most significantly impacted by the economic  downturn.

Additional income support for  individuals The Government is providing $16.8 billion to  support new and existing income support  recipients during the pandemic, with the  temporary Coronavirus Supplement and  expanded eligibility for income support  payments.

The Coronavirus Supplement has been  extended until 31 December 2020 at a rate of  $250 per fortnight from 25 September 2020.

Supporting Pensioners The Government will provide $2.6 billion for  two additional Economic Support Payments of  $250 to pensioners and other eligible recipients.  These payments are additional to the $9.4 billion  in support provided through the two previous  Economic Support Payments of $750 to social  security and other eligible recipients.

Temporary early access to  superannuation The Government has allowed individuals affected  by the adverse economic impacts of COVID-19 to  access up to $10,000 of their superannuation in  2019-20 and is allowing them access to a further  $10,000 up to 31 December 2020.

Your Future, Your Super Reforms to make your  super work harder for you

The Government is committed to making  Australians’ super work harder for them to boost  their retirement savings.

The Government’s Your Future, Your Super  reforms are the next phase of the Government’s  reform agenda and will see Australians save  $17.9 billion over the next decade.

Your superannuation  follows you Unintended superannuation accounts erode  members’ balances through unnecessary fees  and insurance premiums.

For the first time, Australians will automatically  keep their superannuation fund when they  change employers. ‘Stapling’ the super fund to  the employee will ensure that their super follows  them when they change jobs, stopping the  creation of unintended multiple accounts.

Empowering members The Government is making it simple for  Australians to choose a better super fund. This  will result in more competition, which will drive  down fees and increase retirement savings.

The new online YourSuper comparison tool  will help people compare the performance of  MySuper products and make it easy to choose   a fund.

Holding funds to account for  underperformance The Government is protecting members from  super funds that deliver poor outcomes by  requiring funds to meet an annual performance  test. If funds fail the test they will be required  to write to inform members and give them  the option to move their money to a better  performing fund.

Funds that continue to underperform will no  longer be allowed to receive new members until  their performance improves.

Increasing transparency   and accountability The Government is raising the standard for all  super funds to ensure they only spend members’  retirement savings on activities that are in their  best financial interests so as to maximise their  retirement savings.

The Government is also ensuring that super  funds are more transparent by ensuring key  information is provided to members ahead of  Annual Members’ Meetings.

Keeping   Australians safe Securing the online  environment  Australia’s cyber security capabilities are strong,  but the threats we face online are increasing.  COVID-19 has highlighted how much we live and  work online.

The Government will provide an additional  $201.5 million to deliver the 2020 Cyber Security  Strategy, creating a more secure online world for  all Australians.

This takes the Government’s total funding for the  Strategy to $1.7 billion to provide a cyber security  uplift that is fit for purpose in the evolving online  environment.

The Strategy is needed to protect Australians,  their businesses, and the essential services upon  which we depend.

As part of the Strategy, the Government will  invest $37.7 million in growing Australia’s cyber  security skills for an industry that contributes  around 20,000 jobs to the economy.

In addition to creating jobs, the Government is  committed to protecting them. It is estimated  that a significant cyber attack impacting  Australia for four weeks could cost the economy  as much as $30 billion and around 163,000 jobs.  To address the risk of such attacks, the  Government is investing $128.1 million to counter  cyber criminals.

Supporting those   who keep us safe The Australian Federal Police (AFP) is an  organisation with unique capabilities - it must be  agile and able to plan for the long-term.

The Government is committing $300.2 million  to the AFP to strengthen their capacity to keep  Australians safe in an increasingly complex  threat environment.

Supporting our region Ensuring recovery in our region

Australia has a deep and abiding interest in the  stability, prosperity and resilience of the Pacific  and Southeast Asia, reflected in the Pacific  Step-Up and other initiatives.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have  profound negative impacts on our region.  Australia responded quickly to help our  neighbours deal with the immediate health  and economic challenges and will continue to  work alongside our Pacific and Southeast Asian  partners to respond to and recover from this  crisis and support regional development.

COVID-19 vaccines Australia will invest $23.2 million over three  years from 2020-21 on the COVID-19 Vaccine  Access and Health Security Program to support  development of national immunisation policies  in Pacific and Southeast Asian countries. This  will ensure that our neighbours can efficiently  and effectively plan for, and roll out, vaccines  for COVID-19 when they become available. We  will continue to work with partner countries in  support of equitable access to vaccines.

Australia will also provide $80 million to  support the Global Alliance for Vaccines and  Immunisation COVAX Facility Advance Market  Commitment to improve access for Pacific and  Southeast Asian countries to safe, effective and  affordable COVID-19 vaccines. Pacific countries  eligible include Papua New Guinea, Solomon  Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and  Kiribati. Eligible countries from Southeast Asia  are Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Cambodia, Laos,  Myanmar, The Philippines and Vietnam.

COVID-19 Recovery -  Support to the Pacific and  Timor-Leste The Government will provide $304.7 million over  two years from 2020-21 for additional support  for Pacific Island countries and Timor-Leste  to recover from the impacts of COVID-19.  This COVID-19 supplementary funding will  support Pacific governments and Timor-Leste  to deliver essential services, including public  health services, to enhance food security, and  re-establish and sustain air connectivity.

Australian Infrastructure  Financing Facility for the  Pacific Australia continues to support the development  in the region through the Australian  Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific.  Through this Facility, the Government has agreed  a financing package to the Solomon Islands  Electricity Authority to complete the connection  of the Tina River Hydropower Development  Project to the main electricity grid distribution  point in Honiara, the capital. This will provide  access to low cost, reliable electricity to support  economic growth.

Delivering security  infrastructure The Government will provide $124.3 million over  10 years from 2020-21 for further infrastructure  projects in the Southwest Pacific, including to  construct a border and patrol boat outpost in  Solomon Islands’ western provinces.  These  construction projects enhance Australia’s long  standing security cooperation in the region  and expand Australia’s existing Pacific Step-Up  measures.
