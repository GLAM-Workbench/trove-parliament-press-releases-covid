NEW DATA REVEALS IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON EMISSIONS

Today the Morrison Government released the March 2020 Quarterly Update of Australia’s  National Greenhouse Gas Inventory.

Preliminary estimates indicate that coronavirus related restrictions have had a significant  impact on emissions.

It is estimated that emissions in the June quarter 2020 were around 8 per cent or 10 million  tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2-e or million tonnes) lower than a year earlier.

In 2019-20, emissions are estimated to be as low as 518 million tonnes, their lowest level since  1998.

The impact has been most marked in the transport sector, with 26.7 per cent less petrol and  79.0 per cent less jet fuel consumed in the June quarter 2020. Emissions from consumption of  liquid fuels (petrol, diesel and jet fuel) were 17.9 per cent lower than in the June quarter 2019.

Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said that unsustainable restrictions  on Australians’ livelihoods and freedom to travel has substantially reduced emissions.

“With the impacts of COVID-19 restrictions being felt across the economy, emissions have  reduced as expected,” said Minister Taylor.

In the year to March 2020, emissions fell 1.4 per cent (7.7 Mt CO2-e) to 528.7 million tonnes.

This is 14.3 per cent below 2005 levels (the baseline year for Australia’s 2030 Paris target).

When the inventory is adjusted by excluding emissions generated by exports, emissions have  fallen 32 per cent on 2005 levels. This substantial fall reflects the continuing decarbonisation of  Australia’s domestic economy.



Emissions from exports rose 1.9 per cent (3.9 Mt CO2-e) to 38.6 per cent of total emissions. The  increase mainly reflects an 11 per cent increase in our LNG exports to 79 million tonnes in the  year to March 2020 on the year to March 2019. Australia’s LNG exports have the potential to  reduce emissions in importing countries by up to 169 million tonnes each year.

Emissions from electricity continued their long term structural decline, down 4.2 per cent (7.6  Mt CO2-e) in the year to March 2020.

Final emissions data for the June quarter 2020 and the 2019-20 financial year will be published  in late November 2020.
