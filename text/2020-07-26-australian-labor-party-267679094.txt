AGED CARE COMPLAINTS SKYROCKET AS NURSING HOMES FACE  COVID THREAT

New evidence has revealed a surge in complaints about the quality and safety  of Australia’s aged care system as COVID-19 outbreaks grew across the  country.

Complaints to the aged care regulator grew by more than 50% from February  2020 to April 2020, with almost 750 complaints about Australia’s nursing homes  in just one month.

These complaints about the quality and safety of nursing homes are not only  deeply concerning, they are further evidence of how broken our country’s aged  care system is.

In the past few days there have been growing reports about the Morrison  Government’s failure to prepare our country’s nursing homes for outbreaks of  COVID-19.

In the critical weeks leading up to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Victorian  nursing homes, why didn’t the Morrison Government and the aged care  regulator do more to protect older Australians

Yesterday’s announcement of a Victorian aged care response centre while  welcome is sadly too late for some residents, staff and families already  impacted.

Why was the Morrison Government not doing this work sooner?

We have seen the devastating impact of COVID-19 outbreaks in aged care in  Australia and across the globe.



Australia’s aged care system was broken before the COVID-19 pandemic and  this is only putting extra stress on the system.
