Littleproud urges Queensland to adopt Ag workers Code

Agriculture Minister David Littleproud is urging Queensland Labor to adopt the National  Agriculture Workers Code to help the state’s farmers get through the harvest and give  Australians jobs.

The Minister for Agriculture, David Littleproud said Queensland's farmers are crying out for  workers but the state heads into caretaker mode on Tuesday the 6th of October with no Ag  Workers Code in place.

“The Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer has approved the National Ag Workers Code,  and every state and territory that borders Queensland - NSW, SA & NT - has implemented  the Code,” Minister Littleproud said.

“Queensland farmers have already been through drought, bushfires and the coronavirus  pandemic.

“Yet instead of helping farmers, Queensland Labor are sitting on their hands and hoping  the problem fixes itself.

"The national code ensures that workers can travel in a COVID-safe way between states in  order to help farmers harvest their crops.

"Tens of thousands of out of work Australians are being denied the opportunity to come to  Queensland, earn some money and give farmers the help they need.

"There’s still time for Queensland Labor to do the right thing before they clean their desks  out today and sign up to the code and make sure Aussies get first go at Australian jobs,”  Minister Littleproud said.
