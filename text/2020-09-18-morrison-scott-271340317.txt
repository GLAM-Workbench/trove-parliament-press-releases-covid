RETIREMENT OF THE HON. DR JOHN MCVEIGH MP

Dr John McVeigh leaves the Parliament with the respect and admiration of his colleagues. He is a true  gentleman.

This is a difficult time for John and his family. Like all Australians, our obligations to our families come  first. I commend John for his decision and wish him, Anita and their family all the best, and for Anita to  continue on her road to recovery with John by her side.

John was elected to the Parliament in 2016 following service in the Queensland Parliament, including a  term as Queensland Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.

He served as a Cabinet Member from December 2017 to August 2018 as Minister for Regional  Development, Territories and Local Government.

John’s father Tom had also been Member for Groom and served as a Minister in the Fraser Government.  They are one of just a handful of fathers and sons who have served in the Parliament and the Ministry.

Earlier this year, Tom told me he had planned to return to Canberra for his 90th birthday. Whilst COVID  interrupted that plan, I still hope to meet Tom in Canberra sometime in the future.

Like his father before him, I am sure John will continue to play an active community role on the Darling  Downs in the decades ahead.

As Member for Groom, John was proud of the infrastructure projects delivered for his region. Most  notably, the Toowoomba Bypass that opened in 2019 as well as the Inland Rail, for which John has been  a passionate advocate.

John said in his First Speech to Parliament and in his most recent speech that “our future is exciting”. My  hope for him and his family is that they will not lose that optimism in the years ahead.
