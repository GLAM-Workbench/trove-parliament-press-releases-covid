National Farm Safety Education Fund Strategy

Ã¯ÂÂ· Farmsafe Australia has released the National Farm Safety Education Fund Strategy   Ã¯ÂÂ· Industry collaboration is key to shifting workplace safety attitudes in the agriculture  sector  Ã¯ÂÂ· The Australian Government committed $3.5 million in 2019 to improving farm safety

through the National Farm Safety Education Fund

The Australian Government has welcomed the release of a new farm safety strategy that calls for  greater collaborative industry action to promote better practices.

Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said Farmsafe Australia’s National Farm Safety Education  Fund Strategy aims to reduce farming-related injuries and deaths by 2030.

“The health and safety of our farmers and their families is paramount,” Minister Littleproud said.

“Our farmers have continued to kick goals through the COVID-19 pandemic, with the agriculture  sector expected to reach a record $66 billion in industry production this year.

“But it’s a high-risk working environment.

“That’s why the government asked Farmsafe Australia to deliver this report to recommend how we  can improve farm safety and set a long-term course for decision-making.

“Getting better safety outcomes on-farm will require leadership at all levels, from our farmers on  the ground through to our peak bodies and government.

“It’s not just about safer systems, but also about creating safer farmers by shifting attitudes and  improving awareness about workplace risks.

“The impact from every accident, injury or fatality that happens on-farm doesn’t stop in the  workplace.

“Families in our regional and rural communities need to know that their loved ones are going to  come home safely at the end of the day.

“The strategy identifies five key areas for impact: leadership and culture, the next generation of  farmers, physical and psychological well-being, training and continued learning, and evidence and  incentivisation.
