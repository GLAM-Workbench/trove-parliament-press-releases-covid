MORRISON CUTS MORE THAN 110 DEFENCE JOBS

The Morrison Government is cutting more than 110 jobs across the Department of  Defence, including in the intelligence and weapons divisions, according to reports today.

Scott Morrison needs to answer, why?

It beggars belief that just yesterday Scott Morrison was talking about the importance of  Defence and its role in keeping Australians in jobs, to learn today he has cut more than  110 jobs, including from the Defence, Science and Technology Group (DSTG).

We now know that as far as jobs are concerned, this was nothing but a photo opportunity  and a hollow announcement.

Todayâ€™s announcement closely follows a series of calculated job cuts by the Morrison  Government since June, including 30 positions at the National Gallery of Australia, 40 at  the CSIRO and 60 at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Since coming to power, the Liberal-National Government has slashed almost 9,000  Australian Public Service (APS) jobs from Canberra and around 18,000 across the country.

Our most critical and valuable capability are our ADF personnel and the civilian workforce  who support them in the Department of Defence.

So when science and technology is being relied on so much now and into the future, how  does Scott Morrison justify cutting critical Defence Science and Technology Group jobs?

Labor understands these job cuts will see 60 jobs cut in South Australia and more than 40  in Victoria with an unknown number across New South Wales and the ACT.

Scott Morrison has cut more than 110 jobs today, affecting just as many families during a



pandemic and now leaves our Defence Department without critical human resources.
