AUSTRALIA POST ANNUAL RESULTS CONFIRM JUSTIFICATIONS FOR  MORRISON’S SERVICE CUTS WERE A HOAX

Australia Post has just reported a half a billion dollar surge in annual revenues, a result  which affirms that COVID-19 has made Australia Post better off — not worse.

Who could forget the misleading claims made in March and April to justify cuts to Australia  Post services?

“Australia Post forced to slash costs as coronavirus hits revenues”, The Australian,  31 March 2020.

“Australia Post hit with a decades worth of disruption in a month, CEO says”, The  Sydney Morning Herald, 21 April 2020

According to today’s result, parcels revenue grew by $729 million in 2019-2020, and letters  revenue declined by ten per cent, in line with the nine per cent decline in 2018-19.

This draws a line under the nonsense relied on by the Morrison Government to justify their  cuts to postal services.

A detailed chronicle of this is outlined in detail in Labor’s dissenting report to the Senate  Inquiry into the Australia Post regulations.

Australians might be wondering why a Government Business Enterprise which just  recorded a half a billion surge in revenues is not trying to draw attention to this result as  they normally would.

Perhaps it is because the facts simply don’t match the claims that were made to justify the  cuts.

What is clear is the Morrison Government has been misleading Australians about their  postal cuts since day one, and these audited financial results confirm that very fact.
