IMMEDIATE SUPPORT FOR AUSTRALIA’S REFINERIES AND FUEL SECURITY

The Morrison Government is accelerating support for local oil refineries as part of its  commitment to jobs, affordable fuel and Australia’s long-term fuel security.

The Government will provide relief to the refining sector by bringing forward the  production payments announced as part of comprehensive fuel security package in the  2020-21 Budget, with support to begin on 1 January 2021.

Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said the Government was  taking immediate and decisive action to keep our domestic refineries operating.

“The COVID-19 pandemic continues to place immense pressure on our refineries and  the many Australians employed in the fuel sector,” Minister Taylor said.

“We have worked closely with the sector to design and implement our comprehensive  fuel security package.

“The production payments will help the industry withstand the economic shock of this  crisis, protecting local jobs and industry, bolstering our fuel security and shielding  motorists from higher prices.”

The support will be provided through a minimum one cent payment for each litre of  primary transport fuel (petrol, diesel, and jet fuel) from the major domestic refineries  who continue operations in Australia.

The production payment reflects the fuel security benefits refineries provide to the  Australian market.



To receive the payment, refineries must agree to continue to operate for the duration of  the program. Support is also contingent on refineries committing to an open book  process and long-term self-help measures to further inform the development of the  long-term package.

As part of the MYEFO process, the first six months of the production payment will be  funded by the Australian Government, with the package worth $83.5 million.

The long-term market mechanism for the production payment will come into effect no  later than 1 July 2021. The Government is continuing to work with industry to finalise  the market mechanism design in the coming months.

This announcement builds on the Government’s previously announced actions to secure  Australia’s long-term fuel supply and bolster local industry. The 2020-21 Budget  announcement includes three elements:   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Investing $200 million in a competitive grants program to build an

additional 780ML of onshore diesel storage;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Creating a minimum stockholding obligation for key transport fuels;  and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Backing the refining sector through a market mechanism to deliver

a refinery production payment.



Our plan will create 1,000 new jobs and protect workers in the fuel sector and in fuel-dependent industries including manufacturing, agriculture and transport.

The Morrison Government is committed to building-up our domestic capability to  ensure it is appropriate for Australia’s future needs.
