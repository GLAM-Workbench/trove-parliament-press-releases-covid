QUESTIONS OVER WHY LIBERALS FAILED TO FUND CRISIS

ACCOMODATION IN SOUTH EAST MELBOURNE



Hundreds of women and children fleeing violence in South East Melbourne are turned away

from crisis accommodation each year because of the Morrison Government’s failure to

properly fund emergency accommodation.



The Government’s own figures suggest over 313 women and children are turned away from

crisis accommodation in South East Melbourne each year. However, frontline organisations

suggest the number is much higher.



In 2019-20, 5,055 incidences of family violence were reported to Victoria Police in the City of

Casey - the highest number by local Council area in the State. Yet, the Morrison Government’s

Safe Spaces programme has failed to provide any funding for critical crisis accommodation

services in the local council, and in the south east of Melbourne.



The Morrison Government must explain why crucial local organisations, such as Launch

Housing and Endeavour Ministries, have not received financial support under this program

from the Federal Government to continue and expand their critical work.



Across the country, thousands of women and children fleeing family violence have been left

without a safe place to go.



Member for Bruce, Julian Hill said the Government’s grants program to address this crisis does

nothing to meet the actual need in the local community.



“The Safe Places program committed just $60 million across Australia in funding for capital

works over the next two years,” Mr Hill said. “In contrast the Victorian Labor Government has

allocated $215 million supporting victims of family violence and homelessness through the

COVID pandemic.”



“The Liberals funded 40 projects nationally, yet only 7 were in Victoria, and none were in the

City of Casey, the Council with the highest incidence of family violence reports. The Minister

needs to explain what she did with these grants.”



Before COVID-19, at least 9000 women and children were turned away from shelters every

year nationally. It’s likely the true number is now even higher.



Shadow Assistant Minister for Communities and the Prevention of Family Violence, Senator

Jenny McAllister said, “Family and domestic violence is the leading cause of homelessness for

women.”



“The lack of funding for emergency accommodation means that there are fewer beds at

shelters for women and children fleeing family violence.”



Some organisations rent motel rooms for the women and children they can’t accommodate,

but this is only if they can afford to do so. For many women and children, the outcome is

homelessness - couch surfing, sleeping in the car, or on the street.





“No one should be left without the support they need to flee family violence,” Senator

McAllister said.



”The Morrison Government must explain what its plan is for the thousands of women and

children currently being turned away.”
