LABOR: BRING FORWARD SUPPORT FOR WORKERS AND BUSINESS  NOW

Labor is calling on the Government to bring forward support for workers and  business as job-seekers surge and more businesses close their doors.

The Coronavirus Supplement - paid at a rate of $550 per fortnight - will  effectively double the JobSeeker Payment amount (the former Newstart  Allowance).

People are losing their jobs now but the Supplement won’t reach job-seekers until 27 April and won’t be back-paid in the intervening time.

The Second Economic Support Payment won’t be paid until 10 July.  Pensioners and families will have to wait 16 weeks for the payment.

The Boosting Cash Flow for Employers measure is not substantial enough and  isn’t being deployed quickly enough for small and medium enterprises to  survive this unfolding economic crisis.

Australia’s social safety net has been completely overwhelmed with day-long  Centrelink queues, the myGov website crashing, and long wait times for  Centrelink phonelines.



As restrictions of movement continue to expand and more businesses will be  shutting up shop, it is inevitable that we will see more job-seekers in need of  income support.

More Australians are experiencing rapidly changing financial circumstances but  still have bills to pay and meals to put on the table.

This support needs to be brought forward and made available immediately.

Action now will prevent hardship later.
