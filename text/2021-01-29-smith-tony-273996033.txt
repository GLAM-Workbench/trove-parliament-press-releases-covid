COVID-19 Statement by the Presiding Officers regarding Australian Parliament  House access and operations

Following consultation between the Presiding Officers, parliamentary departments and  relevant health officials, the following access arrangements to Australian Parliament House  (APH) are now in place and will remain so for both sitting and non-sitting weeks until further  notice.

Access to Parliament House  APH will remain open to the public in accordance with the ACT Government’s COVID  restrictions. All APH visitors and building occupants must comply with the ACT Government’s  COVID-19 Easing of Restrictions Roadmap. APH will continue to open 7 days per week with the  following arrangements:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Access to the public galleries of the Senate and House of Representatives, and to  committee hearings, will continue with limited numbers in a controlled and COVID Safe  manner.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ All passholders can access private areas.

However, conditions introduced last year remain.

There should be no gathering or waiting around in the public or private areas of the building,  including in the cafÃÂ© or dining spaces, and meetings with building occupants must have been  arranged prior to coming to the building.

School visits   Primary and secondary school visits will continue during sitting weeks and non-sitting weeks.  The APH School Visit Program includes a one-hour comprehensive guided tour of APH by  Visitor Services staff and a one-hour interactive education program conducted by the  Parliamentary Education Office.

Events  The internal event spaces in APH will continue to be used under strict COVID arrangements.   Guidelines on the requirements should be obtained from aphevents@aph.gov.au

Tours for the public  The public can only access the building by booking a guided or self-guided tour. These must be  booked in advance at www.aph.gov.au/tours and will run regularly for up to 90 minutes in  duration.

No more than 500 people are permitted in the public areas of APH at any one time.

Use of Parliament House playing fields  The use of APH playing fields remains under consideration for later in February. Those  interested in accessing and using the playing fields will be required to follow relevant ACT  Public Health Directions. Information about bookings and requirements for users are available  via the Health and Recreation Centre.

Parliament House courtyard access  The ongoing access to APH courtyards for events will be further assessed. In the meantime,  events in courtyards will continue to be managed via the respective Whip’s Offices.

COVID Safe measures  COVID Safe measures are in place to ensure the health and safety of visitors and those working  within APH. These measures include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ COVID Safe information, including reminding people who are unwell or have been in a  COVID hotspot 14-days prior, not to visit APH;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ collection of contact details upon booking to facilitate contact tracing, if necessary;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ single-flow movement of people and physical distancing monitored by tour guides;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ additional cleaning of high-touch points in public areas; and,  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ cashless purchases at all outlets.

Masks   Health officials have asked us to specifically re-emphasise their strong recommendation that  masks should be worn in those areas of the building where people circulate and where  physical distancing is not possible, particularly by those at increased risk of COVID-19. Face  mask kits are available at building entrances and the level 1 cloak room.

For more information on the use of masks, please note the latest advice from the ACT  Government, including the mandatory requirement for face masks for people aged 12 and  over, while inside the Canberra Airport terminal and during domestic commercial flights in and  out of Canberra.
