JOBKEEPER PAYMENT CLARIFICATION NEEDED FOR SMALL

BUSINESS



Small businesses have raised concerns that they may not be eligible for the

JobKeeper payment if they haven’t been in operation for 12 months.



I have written to Senator Michaelia Cash seeking that the government clarify

the eligibility for the JobKeeper payment to businesses that have been in

operation for under 12 months.



Some businesses have suggested the publicly released details of the

JobKeeper payment mean they are ineligible as they may not be able to

compare a current period with significant declines in revenue to a comparable

period a year earlier.





Labor welcomes the wage subsidy announcement and understands measures

such as this will always see some people miss out.



We believe this measure is a step in the right direction, however, we want to

ensure the delay in announcing the wage subsidy doesn’t mean it is too late for

many workers who have already been let go.



We also want to see it delivered quickly for many families and businesses

already struggling.



The Government needs to get this right. It needs to take swift action, provide

support where it’s needed quickly, and make sure gaps don’t remain.



From the start of the Coronavirus crisis Labor has said we will be supportive

and constructive. But we will also continue to advocate for Australians when

there are clear gaps that must be filled.



Labor’s priority is to protect jobs, help Australian workers, businesses, families

and communities through this difficult time, and ensure vulnerable Australians

are supported.
