MORRISON GOVERNMENT MUST RELEASE REPORTS INTO DOROTHY

HENDERSON LODGE AND NEWMARCH HOUSE



The Morrison Government must immediately release reports it commissioned into

outbreaks of COVID-19 in Dorothy Henderson Lodge and Newmarch House nursing

homes.



It is not good enough that the Dorothy Henderson Lodge report which is complete, and the

Newmarch House review that is due to be finished this week, are going to the Royal

Commission instead of being made public.



Why aren’t these reports being made public immediately when Victorian nursing homes

are facing such tragic outbreaks? What is the Morrison Government hiding?



When the Department of Health initiated these reviews, it was very clear that any learnings

would be handed to providers, public health units and regulators to inform responses to the

ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.



It is vitally important that providers across Victoria facing outbreaks have the benefit of

these reviews so lessons can be learnt and applied to current outbreaks.



To date it sadly seems the Morrison Government has learnt little from the tragic outbreaks



of COVID-19 in New South Wales nursing homes.



We have seen the devastating impact of COVID-19 outbreaks in aged care in Australia

and across the globe.



Why was the Morrison Government not better prepared for outbreaks that would impact

our nation’s most vulnerable?



Australia’s aged care system was broken before the COVID-19 pandemic and this is only

putting extra stress on the system.



The Morrison Government must act now for our most vulnerable older Australians.
