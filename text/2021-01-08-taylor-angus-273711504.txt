BOOSTING AUSTRALIA’S DIESEL STORAGE

The Morrison Government is taking action to increase Australia’s onshore diesel  stockholdings, create jobs and keep fuel prices low for consumers.

Open to applications on 11 January 2021, the Boosting Australia’s Diesel Storage  program is a key part of the Government’s comprehensive fuel security package to  secure Australia’s long-term fuel supply and bolster local industry.

The package also includes:    Ã¢ÂÂ¢ backing the local refining sector through a production payment that values the

fuel security benefits provided by a sovereign refining capability; and   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ creating a minimum stockholding obligation for key transport fuels.



Our plan will create new jobs and protect workers in fuel dependent industries,  including manufacturing, resources, agriculture and transport.

Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said Australia’s fuel security  was essential for our national security and underpins our entire economy.

“The Morrison Government will oversee the roll-out of the diesel program this year,  which will not only create jobs, but will help to make sure Australian families and  businesses can access the fuel they need, when they need it,” Minister Taylor said.

“Fuel, and diesel in particular, is the lifeblood of so many sectors in our economy,  including our farmers, truckies and tradies. It is essential that we get the right balance  and location of our onshore stockholdings.

“Increasing Australia’s capacity to store diesel complements our other fuel security  measures. This will strengthen our ability to manage potential disruptions, protect  Australian motorists from future high prices, and keep our economy moving.”

Through the Boosting Australia’s Diesel Storage Program, the Government will provide  up to $200 million in competitive grants over three years to support the construction of  an additional 780 megalitres of onshore diesel storage.

These projects will help to further enhance our fuel security and create around 1,000  jobs, supporting the Government’s JobMaker Plan as we recover from COVID-19.

Successful projects will receive grants of up to $33.3 million, with the Government  covering up to 50 per cent of total eligible project expenditure. Projects are expected to  commence construction from mid-2021 and be completed within three years.

The Government seeks to target projects that enhance fuel security by being in a  strategic regional location or that are connected to existing fuel infrastructure.

The program will also assist industry in meeting the new minimum stockholding  obligation by 2024. The obligation will require industry to hold around 40 per cent more  diesel than current levels.

Diesel is crucial to Australia’s energy security as it underpins our critical infrastructure,  transport sector and important industries, such as mining and agriculture. It is also  critical during an emergency for essential services.

The Government is committed to building-up our domestic fuel capability to ensure it is  appropriate for Australia’s future needs.
