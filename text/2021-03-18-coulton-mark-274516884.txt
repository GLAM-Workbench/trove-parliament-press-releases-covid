Subjects: vaccination rollout in Australia and PNG

** check against delivery **



ANNA MOULDER:

Mark Coulton is the Federal Minister for Regional Health. Good afternoon, Minister.

MARK COULTON:

Good afternoon, Anna.

ANNA MOULDER:

1800 calls in just one day, can you believe it?

MARK COULTON:

Look, I think in some ways it's good news and bad news. I think the good news is that people are  enthusiastic about getting the vaccine. Probably, you know, there’s a lot of excitement about it.  We're just asking people just take a deep breath and take their time. Next week, we're doing 1B,  which is health workers, people over 70, it's not everyone and it's going to be over a period of time.  It does not have to be done in the first week.

So, I know, Anna, that not everyone has access to or is comfortable using online booking services, but  we really are encouraging anyone that does have that ability to go to health.gov.au and go on to the  eligibility checker, and that's the way that we will do this in an orderly way. But obviously, some folk  find that a little bit daunting, they'll be the ones that ring through. But, you know, I thought the  doctor you spoke to yesterday was very sensible a way that he manages any surgery even though it  was probably a little bit unexpected.

ANNA MOULDER:

Yeah, I guess, you know, physically taking that many calls as well can be quite overwhelming. I mean,  it did take this clinic by surprise and we've heard that it wasn't the only one because they didn't  realise they would be listed as ready to accept bookings so soon. Do you think the rollout has been  managed as well as it could be at this point now?

MARK COULTON:

Look, you know, obviously, going back in hindsight, there’s probably things that may be done  differently, but I think we're pretty well on track, and it is such a big logistics exercise and it does take  a little while for people to understand what the process is. And I think the other thing that's  complicated it a little bit is that the supplies have been quite low, you know, it's not every clinic that's

been announced. We announced a thousand this week, they'll be sort of 4000 all together over the  next few weeks. Those first couple of clinics that were announced, have probably copped a fair bit of  interest, but I think as we ramp up, as more of the Australian-produced vaccine comes online and we  have more product, then I think that people will start to understand the rhythm and the method  that's going to happen.

ANNA MOULDER:

Mark Coulton, our guest this afternoon on ABC Radio New South Wales, Federal Minister for  Regional Health. Someone working in a GP clinic in Tamworth also got in touch yesterday to say that  clinics don't know when exactly they’ll be receiving their allocations of the vaccines and that's why  they can't give their patients certainty just yet. She told us it was as supply was available. How  thorough will those communications to clinics be now as the rollout progresses?

MARK COULTON:

Yeah, look, that will get better. But at the moment, it is as supply comes available, those clinics will  be notified, it will be a slower start and a ramp up. So I know a lot of people want certainty right from  the start. People in all age groups and all the people that will be dispensing it would like to know  straight up but we are rolling this out as we have product and as we come online. We’ll end up with  4,000 GP clinics, most of the respiratory clinics - I think we’ve announced about 105 of those, but  there’ll be more of those to come - Aboriginal medical services, and then, in the next phase, the  pharmacies will come online as well. So, that’ll be a much broader number of, I guess, options for  people to go to, but at the start, there’s a lot of excitement.

ANNA MOULDER:

How much notice can the clinics and those who will be delivering the services get, do you think,  ahead of arrival of the vaccines? Do you have a sense of that?

MARK COULTON:

Look, not really, Anna, at this stage. I think that will get better as we have more supply. But what’s  basically happening now is we find out how much we’ve got in for that week and then the authorities  need to actually work out how that’s going to be distributed to the best of ability. So, we’ve  vaccinated about 200,000 Australians at the moment over the first sort of three weeks, but next  week, we’re expecting 250,000 vaccines to be available. So, you can see there is going to be a ramp  up and more available, and then, hopefully, that anxiety about being on the list will dissipate  somewhat.

ANNA MOULDER:

We know that the availability of vaccines and production as well obviously is on people's minds and I  wanted to ask you about a couple of the other things that are happening in this space of COVID and  the vaccine. Can you explain what's going on in PNG at the moment and why that is actually quite  important for our community here in New South Wales?

MARK COULTON:

There's a couple of reasons why what's happening in PNG at the moment is important. One is  obviously the potential for a humanitarian disaster in Port Moresby with a large population; that  insufficient intensive care to deal with people should they become very, very ill. And anyone that's  been to Port Moresby will realise that it is- there is a lot of people and you know, living in not great

conditions. The other part of it is that our border to the north is very, very porous and very close.  And Saibai Island is 10 minutes in a tinny from Mainland PNG and a lot of the islands is Torres Strait,  you know, hop from one of the other. One’s a PNG island, the other one’s an Australian island. A lot  of those families are interrelated and it’s quite a blended- it's not a direct border, it’s quite a blended  border. We need to help our northern neighbours because they really are in a difficult situation the  moment. But we also need to make sure that we're protecting our northern border and we don't  have COVID coming into the country through the Torres Strait and into north Queensland that way.

ANNA MOULDER:

How would you describe your level of concern around what's happening there in the north then?

MARK COULTON:

Look, I think the greater level of concern probably is what's happening in Port Moresby, and some of  the larger centres. And it's one of the reasons why we've been incredibly nervous for the last 14  months and very, very careful to protect some of our more remote communities that have higher  levels of maybe chronic illness, and not the on-site levels of intensive care that you would have in a  larger centre. So you know, we don't want to a humanitarian disaster on our doorstep. It just would  be terrible to see that. But also making sure that we're protecting our Torres Strait as well.

ANNA MOULDER:

Our Federal Minister for Regional Health, Member for Parkes, Mark Coulton with us this afternoon  on ABC Radio New South Wales, it’s 24 after 4.

So in Europe we’re simultaneously seeing a lot of concern around the AstraZeneca vaccine’s safety  and at the same time some countries are trying to retain vaccine supplies for themselves. What are  we going to see there? I understand it's Thursday in Europe, Europe time. They'll be considering the  AstraZeneca vaccine more closely and coming to some sort of conclusion that could impact us. Will  that affect our supplies?

MARK COULTON:

It might keep it a bit slower but next week or the week after we’re starting to see the production of  our own supplies here in Australia, and ultimately we're planning to do 50 million doses here in  Australia with the facility down in Victoria, in a way you can sort of understand that you know,  Australia's the safest country probably on the globe for the last 14 months and regional Australia is  probably the safest place to live anywhere, we're probably a little bit removed of- you know, in  Europe there's a lot of countries that are still losing hundreds of people on a daily basis , obviously  they're very concerned and that's why we saw the rollout happen quicker in Europe. They actually  brought in emergency measures because of the amount of deaths that they had. You know,  obviously we need to keep the pressure on to make sure that we're getting the supply through to  Australia, but it's probably understandable because of the health crisis that they're having. But when  we produce our own here either next week or the week after, we'll start to see the situation here, a  lot more vaccines flow through to the broader community.

ANNA MOULDER:

Well if we talk on the topic of concern, Mark Coulton, around safety, I must I don't even get junk  mail, but I was lucky enough to receive a flyer in my mailbox, bright yellow, it was questioning the  safety of the vaccines. It was signed from Clive Palmer. We know a lot of similar flyers from different

organisations, particularly down in Bega as well. How are you handling concern about vaccine safety  and efficacy?

MARK COULTON:

Yeah. Well, we all know that Clive Palmer is a well renowned medical specialist - not. And I find that  incredibly irresponsible for that and I'm looking at another one here in front of me now, Anna, about,  you know, you'll be the guinea pig. People need to understand and I want to explain that the  vaccines that have come through Australia, whether they've been produced in Australia or we're  importing from overseas, have gone through the exact same process and scrutiny as any other  pharmaceutical product that people would either being prescribed by a doctor or buying from a  chemist. , we, despite what's happened overseas, we've independently tested this. I was speaking to  the leading vaccine advisor to the Australian Department of Health in my office here yesterday and  they are leaving no stone unturned in the scrutiny we’re placing on this. I guess in a way of  explanation of some of the things that happen, the more and more people that get vaccinated and  across Europe and other parts, it's now in millions, the chances that someone will have a medical  episode the week after they’ve had a vaccine purely as a random event not caused by it, the more  people we get done the more we see that's an opportunity. But it doesn't mean that every medical  activity, medical thing that happens to someone is actually connected to the vaccine. So we haven't  found any direct connection to blood clots. With regards to anaphylaxis, that's part of- anyone that is  susceptible to anaphylaxis reactions would need to make sure they explain that to the person giving  them the vaccine. And they probably would need- the recommendation is that they stay under  observation probably for half an hour instead of the recommended 15 minutes to be observed after  that happens. But it's still- the vaccines are still considered very safe and very effective. And  realistically for safety as individual Australians, their families and their communities, it's  recommended that when the opportunity comes for them to step up and get the vaccine, that they  take that opportunity.

ANNA MOULDER:

Well, we thank you for the update, obviously plenty to cover this afternoon and it will continue no  doubt. Mark Coulton, we appreciate your time.

MARK COULTON:

Happy to talk anytime, Anna. Thank you very much.

ANNA MOULDER:

Thank you. Federal Minister for Regional Health, Member for Parkes. That's Mark Coulton on ABC  Radio New South Wales.





Ends.
