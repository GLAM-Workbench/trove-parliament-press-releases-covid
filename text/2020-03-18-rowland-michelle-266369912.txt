LABOR WELCOMES TEMPORARY NBN CAPACITY RELIEF FOR TELCOS

Labor welcomes the decision by NBNCo to provide retail providers with up to  40 per cent extra capacity over the coming months in response to COVID-19.

On Monday, Labor called for NBNCo to consider temporary capacity relief to  help retailers avoid broadband speed congestion as more Australians spend  time at home on the internet.

By committing to a temporary capacity boost the risk of congestion or higher  wholesale costs for retailers appears to be well mitigated.

“Labor congratulates NBNCo for taking this initiative and acting in the public  interest”, Ms Rowland said.

“Connectivity is vital - whether it be for teleworking, telehealth, education or  keeping our spirits up with entertainment.”

“This is an example of how industry can work together to support the Australian  community during times of crisis. We saw this during the bushfires and I am  pleased we have seen it again this week.”
