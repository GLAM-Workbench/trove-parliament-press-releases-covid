Greens to introduce law for 14 days coronavirus leave for all effected workers

Greens Leader Adam Bandt MP said that when parliament resumes, the Greens will introduce legislation to provide 14 days’ paid sick leave to all workers affected by the coronavirus. The ACTU has called for 2 weeks paid sick leave for workers affected by the virus.

The Fair Work Amendment (COVID 19) Bill will mean the 3.3 million workers currently without paid leave entitlements will be able to access paid sick leave if affected by the virus, and will also ensure workers with leave provisions are not forced to exhaust their sick leave balances if their company temporarily closes because of the virus.

The bill would cover workers diagnosed with COVID 19, those required to self-isolate or who are caring for a family member affected by the virus. Workers whose workplace temporarily closes because of the virus will also be covered.

“The Morrison government must not leave Australian workers to fend for themselves during this crisis,” Mr Bandt said.

“Workers should be able to follow government advice to self-isolate without losing their income or their job.

“If we don’t pass this bill, coronavirus could spread faster because workers without paid sick leave who are affected by the virus may feel pressured to come to work instead of staying home.

“The government should urgently make this change to the law and then use their stimulus package to help small and medium businesses meet the additional costs.”

“If the government won’t act, the Greens will, and we’ll dare them to vote on the floor of Parliament against supporting workers.”
