Senator Molan launches #AnzacAtHome for ANZAC Day

Senator for New South Wales Jim Molan has today announced he is launching the #AnzacAtHome  campaign to highlight the ANZAC experiences of Australians during the challenge of the COVID-19  pandemic.

“Staying at home on April 25th feels inherently wrong to Australians, but I believe that by sharing how we  will be commemorating ANZAC Day at home, we can continue to make our veterans proud,” Senator Molan  said.

Senator Molan is encouraging Australians to share their ANZAC stories and how they commemorate the  day on social media, using the hashtag #AnzacAtHome to bring them all together.

The Senator noted it was important that commemoration doesn’t just reflect those who have served.

“Every year we see schoolchildren across Australia involved in Legacy and ANZAC Day services, many of  whom may not have a connection directly to a veteran but still understand the importance of  commemorating those who have served,” Senator Molan said.

“This is an opportunity for all to share their stories of commemoration, as well as sharing how they will be  marking a unique ANZAC Day in 2020.”

Senator Molan is also seeking to upload messages from members of the community to his social media  channels, and is suggesting that those who would like to participate to email him at  senator.molan@aph.gov.au or message him on Facebook.

“This is a way we can all recognise our veterans, while still fighting the challenge of the coronavirus.”
