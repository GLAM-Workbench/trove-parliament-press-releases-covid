TRANSCRIPT





Interview, ABC Queensland Country Hour  24 March 2020

Subjects: COVID-19 response in regional areas



AMY PHILLIPS:

But first up - and I apologise this is quite sobering - but the Federal Regional Health Minister says  while fever clinics are being set up across regional Queensland, the first being Emerald, shortages of  medical staff, transfer aircraft and personal protective supplies are issues all still being worked on.  Mark Coulton says regional areas won't be able to cope with large outbreaks of COVID-19 and  implores all residents to practice social distancing for the benefit of your vulnerable community. He  says he's quite disappointed to hear of grey nomads heading north before Queensland closes its  borders. But he says, overall, he does not agree that outback communities should lock out visitors.

MARK COULTON:

I think we need to be focusing on the behaviour of individuals. I think the real message is we all have  a responsibility for this. Now, if the grey nomads were behaving irresponsibly and having large  gatherings and hugging and kissing when they pull up at night time, that would be a big issue. But if  they're keeping their distance, I don't think it's a real threat.

AMY PHILLIPS:

Same goes with airports. I understand people are able to disembark from a regional air service if  they've come from, let's say, the likes of Brisbane to Mount Isa, there's no signage saying: please,  disinfect yourself at least before you step out now into our community. No signs saying: please  isolate yourself if you're concerned. And therefore, they are able to disperse into the community. Is  that good enough?

MARK COULTON:

People that are going into those regional areas do need to have a very good reason for doing so and  they need to be personally responsible for their behaviour when they get there.

The message is we need to keep regional Australia working because, to a large degree, we have the  ability to keep operating. Farmers need to be working in a timely manner. You need to be spraying  the weeds or planting a crop or milking your cows.

You can't just park everything up and stay at home. The more people that we can keep working, the  less people who are going to be disadvantaged by losing their jobs and going onto unemployment  benefits. But to do that, everyone is going to have to play their role and be responsible for their own  behaviour.



AMY PHILLIPS:

This all in mind, why wouldn't regional communities shut themselves down? Can they go into  lockdown? Why wouldn't they if they need to continue to make food for the rest of Australia and  have very limited medical services?

MARK COULTON:

I don't know that we have the ability to have a complete lockdown. Our advantage is that we have  low population.

We should be able to manage it. But everyone has got to play their part to make sure that we reduce  the rate of infection.

AMY PHILLIPS:

Alright. Let's talk about what's being done in regional areas medically. How are people in regional  communities being tested for suspected COVID-19? Where do they go? What do they do?

MARK COULTON:

Now we've expanded the use of telehealth so that the doctors can actually talk to you at home and  talk through your symptoms and ask questions about your movements, where that may be a  possibility.

That's not going and turning up at emergency or turning up in the clinic, it's phoning in and seeking  advice.

We are in the process of installing and constructing fever clinics and a hundred of those will be going  around Australia.

I think probably one of the first we'll see in regional Queensland will probably be at Emerald. Those  procedures are working through now very quickly.

When those clinics are set up across the countryside, they will be able to - if the numbers of  infections increase - deal with that to try and keep the pressure off the hospital system that also has  to maintain its role in looking after people who are already ill from other regions.

AMY PHILLIPS:

And just finally, is there enough PPE, protective equipment, for medical staff in regional areas?

MARK COULTON:

Yes. Look, PPE is an issue. There is more coming in all times. And the primary health-

AMY PHILLIPS:

[Interrupts] So there's not enough?

MARK COULTON:

There is enough for the purpose that we need, but there's not enough for every facility to have a  stockpile in their cupboard. But there's more coming in all the time. Thereâ€™s PPE masks and  equipment that is being manufactured locally as well.

AMY PHILLIPS:

Is there enough staff? What happens if doctors get ill? How are they going to be replaced in regional  areas?

MARK COULTON:

So, we've changed, through the telehealth regulations, and even as late as yesterday, so particularly  doctors who may be vulnerable, in the older age bracket, may be some that are carrying chronic  conditions themselves, they now can do a lot of work from home, on telephone.

Doctors with young families that may be vulnerable can work from home as well.

But we're also sourcing recently retired doctors to step up and help out where they can.

I've been speaking with the Rural Doctors Association and they are working through at the moment  how that might tie in with their regular process of their education.

But we are bringing in as many resources as we can. But we're also putting into play procedures so  that we can protect our medical staff as best we can because you are right - we can't afford, in the  smaller communities, for our medical staff to become unwell and so we are changing things on a  regular basis to make sure that we can put those things into protected.

We are in uncharted territory. And as the situations change, we're actually- the governments, state  and federal, are changing to adapt too.

AMY PHILLIPS:

Just finally, the RFDS has 20 planes in Queensland. They wouldn't all be in use at the same time, of  course. They transfer a patient every two minutes is what is said on their website. How long might  people expect to wait for an RFDS transfer?

MARK COULTON:

They're looking at sourcing other aircraft. And also, in discussions with pilots, with experience in the  PC-12s or the other aircraft that the Flying Doctor use that may be underutilised at the moment,  bringing them back into service. And so, they are certainly looking at that ability. As of yesterday,  they have transferred 17 patients.

AMY PHILLIPS:

Yeah, but how long might people have to wait?

In 2016, my daughter and I waited 14 hours. I don't know if that's a long time or a short time. Could  you expect that to blowout?

MARK COULTON:

I can't answer that question from where I sit. All I can assure people is, is that the Royal Flying Doctor  Service is aware of the task that is before them and they are putting procedures and resources in  play to be able to handle that as well as they can.

Ends.
