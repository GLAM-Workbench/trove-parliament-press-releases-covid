The Economic Recovery  Plan for Australia The 2020-21 Budget advances the  Government’s plan for Australia’s

economic recovery.

The first phase of the Government’s revised Economic and Fiscal Strategy is the COVID-19 Economic  Recovery Plan. It reflects the Government’s overarching objective to return Australians to work and  boost prosperity as Australia emerges from the COVID-19 crisis.

This fact sheet outlines the key measures from the COVID-19 Economic Recovery Plan. This Budget  provides $98 billion of response and recovery support under the COVID-19 Response Package and the  JobMaker Plan, bringing the Government’s overall support to $507 billion, over half of which is direct  economic support.

JobMaker Plan This Budget provides $74 billion in measures  under the JobMaker Plan to drive stronger  economic recovery and drive down the

unemployment rate.

The five-year JobMaker Plan focuses on driving  sustainable, private sector led growth and job  creation, recognising that a stronger economy  will strengthen the budget and ensure Australia  is well placed to respond to future shocks.

COVID-19 Response Package This Budget includes $25 billion in additional  temporary and targeted support in response to  the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 Response Package continues  to be tailored to each phase of the crisis. The  Government has deployed temporary and  targeted health and economic measures to  support those in need, with additional support

provided in this Budget.
