CELEBRATING AUSTRALIA’S WORLD-CLASS VOCATIONAL  EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR AWARD FINALISTS

Australia’s best and brightest in vocational education and training (VET) has been recognised  with the announcement of the seventy-five finalists for the 2020 Australian Training Awards.

The Australian Training Awards set to be held on 20 November, recognise the achievements  in VET across apprentices, trainees, educators, employers and training providers.

“We know it’s been a tough year, but these finalists have shone through and will be an  inspiration for those thinking about a career in VET,” Minister Cash said.

“A strong VET sector will ensure our economy can grow and meet the demand for the skilled  workforce of the future, creating a pipeline of Australian tradies and trained workers.

“The 2020 Australian Training Awards, which will an online event for the first time in its 26-year history, will help reinforce the benefits of a vibrant VET sector.

“This is a fantastic chance to recognise hard-working Australians and the career journeys  they are undertaking, as well as testimony to their dedication, their skills and their passion.”

The award categories cover students, apprentices, trainees, teachers, schools, registered  training organisations and employers, as well as recognising national excellence and a  lifetime achievement award.

Assistant Minister for Vocational Education, Training and Apprenticeships, the Hon Steve  Irons MP, said the Morrison Government is proud to support the Australian Training Awards,  and committed to supporting the VET sector.

“In this year’s Budget we announced the $1.2 billion Boosting Apprenticeship  Commencements wage subsidy to support 100,000 new apprentices and trainees.
