NAIDOC WEEK 2020



NAIDOC Week celebrates the history, culture and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander peoples.

Always Was, Always Will Be. recognises that Indigenous Australians have occupied and cared for  this continent for over 65,000 years.

This year we come together in a different way, as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 Pandemic,  and while we might be celebrating our community, culture and history virtually, or in smaller  number, it does not diminish our strength or reason to be proud of our achievements.

This years’ NAIDOC Week is an invitation for all Australians to reflect and understand our nation’s  shared history.

It’s an invitation to gain a greater understanding of the role Indigenous Australians have played in  building and shaping the nation that we all call home today.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were Australia’s first explorers, first navigators, first  engineers, first farmers, first botanists, first scientists, first diplomats, first astronomers and first  artists.

Our culture is as important today as it was 65,000 years ago - Indigenous Australians are spiritually  and culturally connected to this country - and we continue to regain and strengthen our culture  through language and truth-telling, an exploration of our shared history.

In 2020, Indigenous Australians continue to contribute to our nation’s rich fabric - people travel  from around the world to experience our culture - and we are growing our presence abroad.

Our story makes up so much of the Australian story.

I wish you well in your NAIDOC Week celebrations, and hope that you use this opportunity to unite  and continue to forge a stronger path towards reconciliation.





THE HON KEN WYATT AM MP  Minister for Indigenous Australians
