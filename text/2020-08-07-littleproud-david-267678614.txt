Wine export grants a corker of an opportunity

Ã¯ÂÂ· Wine Export Grant guidelines expanded for producers to all export markets  Ã¯ÂÂ· Small to medium wine producers eligible for reimbursements up to $25,000

The Australian Government is uncorking another $1 million in funding to support smaller to  medium wine producers showcase their premium drops around the world.

Minister for Agriculture David Littleproud today released guidelines for a second round of  the Wine Export Grant - part of the $50 million Export and Regional Wine Support  Package.

“Whether it’s a Barossa Valley Shiraz, a King Valley Prosecco or a Hunter Valley Semillon,  the world loves a good Aussie drop,” Minister Littleproud said.

“These grants will help our smaller to medium sized wine producers access the lucrative  world wine market by promoting the Aussie product internationally as some of the safest,  most sustainable and highest quality wine in the world.

“In these uncertain economic times, it’s important industry and the Australian Government  work together to seize these opportunities and help drive our Covid-19 recovery.

“Australian Grape and Wine and Wine Australia approached me earlier this year with a  proposal to run another round of these grants, with tweaks to ensure producers could  diversify to more markets and claim a broader range of expenses for online promotion of  their brands.”

“Our wine producers large or small are major contributors to Team Australia and the  Government recognises the pandemic has made promotional activities more challenging.

“The Wine Export Grant is helping eligible producers meet the costs associated with  marketing their products with reimbursements of up to $25,000.

“I’m pleased to announce this sensible second round of these grants that has  accommodated industry’s sensible suggestions for amending the guidelines and will  support our small wine producers to drive export growth and share our unique wines with  the world.” Minister Littleproud said.

‘The grant is open to businesses that received funding in round 1’, Mr Clark said.

Eligible claims include the reimbursement of:

Ã¯ÂÂ· specific travel expenses for a single promotional visit (daily allowance, limits apply)  Ã¯ÂÂ· the cost of providing free samples of wine, including freight or transport  Ã¯ÂÂ· participation in trade fairs (including online and virtual promotions)  Ã¯ÂÂ· in-store promotions, and  Ã¯ÂÂ· marketing and advertising collateral specific to your international audience

The grants are open for applications from 17 August 2020 until 1 May 2021 or until the  funds are exhausted, whichever comes first. Applications are assessed on a first-come,  first-served basis.
