Roadmap to guide National Ag Workforce vision

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The National Agricultural Workforce Strategy report has been released.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A new Roadmap has also been launched outlining the government’s vision for the  sector and next steps.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Developing human capital will be key to delivering the Government’s Ag2030 plan over

the medium to long-term.

The Australian Government has released the National Agricultural Labour Advisory Committee’s  report - National Agricultural Workforce Strategy: Learning to excel, together with a Roadmap to  attract, retain, upskill and modernise the agricultural workforce.

Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management David Littleproud said the Roadmap  addresses the main themes raised in the National Agricultural Workforce Strategy report submitted  to the government in late December by the independent National Agricultural Labour Advisory  Committee.

“The Roadmap outlines the government’s vision for the sector and broadly outlines the next steps  for taking the roadmap themes forward,” Minister Littleproud said.

“It also sets out the actions the government has taken over the past 12 months to address the  immediate workforce needs of our agricultural sector as a result of the impacts of COVID-19.

“The strategy report examined issues from education and industrial relations to technological  innovation and supply chains.

“Many of the report’s 37 recommendations require collaboration with different levels of  government, co-design with industry and delivery in partnership with a wide range of stakeholders.

“With the strategy report and the Roadmap released, the government will undertake targeted  consultation with industry and state and territory governments, to ensure all parties are just as  committed as the Australian Government to a highly skilled agricultural workforce.

“The development of a fit-for-purpose workforce for our farming sector is part of the Australian  Government’s Ag2030 plan in support of industry’s $100 billion target by 2030.

“The Government will respond to the Strategy report in the coming months and the meantime we  will continue to address the immediate needs of our farmers for workers.”

“I’d like to thank the National Agricultural Labour Advisory Committee, in particular the Chair, Mr  John Azarias, for the work they have put into developing the Strategy Report for government.”
