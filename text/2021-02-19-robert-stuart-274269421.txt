Get ready for your vaccination: link your digital government services

The Morrison Government is encouraging Australians to get ready for their COVID-19 vaccination by  linking their digital government services, particularly their myGov and Medicare accounts. The call to  link digital services follows the announcement that the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) will be  the record for all vaccinations for Australians and that record will form the basis of the vaccination  certificate that all Australians will be able to use, including visa holders.

The AIR has undergone significant upgrades in preparation for COVID-19 vaccine rollout. The AIR  already allows you to see your recorded immunisations through myGov or the Medicare Express Plus  app through an ‘immunisation history statement’. Almost 5.5 million immunisation history statements  were securely accessed by individuals between October 2019 and August 2020. Your immunisation  history statement will record your COVID-19 vaccinations.

Minister for Government Services Stuart Robert encouraged all Australians to link their myGov and  Medicare online services today to ensure they can access proof they have had a COVID-19  vaccination, quickly and easily.

‘The Morrison Government is getting on with the vaccine rollout so we’re asking Australians to be  vaccination-ready and link their digital services today,’ Minister Robert said.

‘Services Australia has been putting in the work to ensure government services are simple, respectful,  transparent and helpful - so we have supercharged myGov and we have state-of-the art cybersecurity  in place to protect the Australian Immunisation Register.’

‘Linking your myGov and Medicare digital accounts is a simple step you can take right now that will  help you and your family be ready for a vaccinated Australia.’

Data from Services Australia indicates there are currently 19.7 million active myGov Accounts with  9.9 million linked to Medicare. Since 30 June 2020, on average 150,000 new myGov accounts have  been created and linked to a member service each month and 92,000 myGov accounts have been  linked to Medicare each month.

If you already have your Medicare account linked in myGov, make sure you check your contact details  are up to date.
