Qantas temporary capacity reductions in response to coronavirus

Itâ€™s disappointing, but understandable that Qantas have announced temporary reductions  to flight capacity across Asia as well as small temporary reductions domestically, given the  current impact of the coronavirus on global traveller demand.

I welcome the decision by Qantas to keep all of their routes across Asia and within their  domestic network open, and that these temporary reductions in capacity will not result in  any job losses.

By keeping all of their routes across the network operational, it will be easier for Qantas to  again increase the capacity and frequency of flights when conditions improve and traveller  confidence picks-up.

Our Government continues to work with our industry partners, including Qantas, to  implement our unprecedented $76 million injection to boost tourism activity across  Australia. This includes $20 million for a domestic campaign to encourage Australians to  Holiday Here This Year as well as tens of millions of dollars to lift bookings from  international markets.

During this period, I also urge Australians to continue with confidence to travel within  Australia. The best way Australians can support our tourism and hospitality businesses  who are doing it tough and to save local jobs is to holiday here this year.
