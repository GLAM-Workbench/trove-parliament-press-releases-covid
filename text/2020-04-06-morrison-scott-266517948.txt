MEDIA RELEASE



Monday 6 April 2020  TRANSFER OF MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY



Responsibility for public service matters, including the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC), has  been temporarily transferred from the Minister for Health, the Hon. Greg Hunt, MP to the Hon. Ben  Morton MP, Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

This will allow Minister Hunt to concentrate wholly on the coronavirus response in his Health portfolio.

At this time, the focus of all agencies, departments and employees is on delivering the critical functions,  services and needs that Australians rely on.

Their efforts are keeping Australians healthy, saving lives and livelihoods and ensuring our nation  bounces back strongly on the other side of this global pandemic.

The Australian Public Service Commission is engaged in the coronavirus response including managing  the redeployment of public servants to support the critical and continued delivery of Government  services.
