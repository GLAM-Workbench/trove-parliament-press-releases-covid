$6 million injection for Queensland’s Flood Warning  Infrastructure Network

Queensland communities impacted by the devastating 2019 monsoon floods will benefit  from a $6 million investment in vital flood warning infrastructure.

This is part of the joint state and Commonwealth $242 million Category C and D package  established under the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements in response to the 2019  floods, and brings total network funding through DRFA to $8 million.

Minister for Emergency Management David Littleproud said the additional funding was  another important step towards a safer and more resilient north Queensland.

“The initial $2 million funded 36 flood warning projects across 16 of the most heavily  impacted areas following last year’s monsoon trough,” Minister Littleproud said.

“This announcement will see more priority repairs and installations reach 28 impacted local  government areas, from Torres Strait to Mackay.

“We want to better protect Queensland communities by ensuring they are well informed  when there’s flood risk in their region.

“Since the devastating floods of 2011, Queensland has been at the forefront of disaster  mitigation and resilience in Australia, and this investment further solidifies that position.”

Queensland Treasurer and Minister responsible for the Queensland Reconstruction  Authority (QRA) Cameron Dick said infrastructure investment was central to the  Queensland Government’s COVID economic recovery plan.

“These initiatives bring employment benefits in the short-term and provide significant value  in the long-term by protecting Queenslanders and their communities,” Mr Dick said.

“An estimated 25 jobs will be created in regional Queensland from this work, jobs which  are really welcomed during this tough economic period.

“In the past 18 months our state has battled floods, bushfires, a pandemic, and the  financial fallout from all those things.

“Investing in infrastructure like this flood warning network will keep driving our recovery  efforts forward.”

QRA Chair Major-General Stuart Smith AO, DSC (Retd) said the authority was pleased to  roll out the program to impacted council areas.

“The improvements will include rainfall and river level gauges, cameras and flood warning  signage,” Mr Smith said.

“This aligns with the national standards the Bureau of Meteorology require and will deliver  optimum catchment-based solutions across Queensland.

“QRA is committed to building resilience against future natural disaster events, including  pandemics.

“These improvements will go a long way to helping make Queensland the most disaster-resilient state in the nation.”

The 28 Queensland councils to benefit from this investment : Burke, Boulia, Burdekin,  Carpentaria, Cairns, Cassowary, Charters Towers, Cloncurry, Cook, Croydon, Diamantina,  Douglas, Etheridge, Flinders, Hinchinbrook, Lockhart River, Longreach, Mackay, Mapoon,  Mareeba, McKinlay, Richmond, Pormpuraaw, Torres Strait, Townsville, Whitsunday,  Winton and Wujal Wujal.
