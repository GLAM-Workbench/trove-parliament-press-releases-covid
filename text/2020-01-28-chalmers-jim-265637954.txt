BUSINESS CONFIDENCE PLUNGES TO LOWEST LEVEL IN SIX YEARS



New data out today shows business confidence has fallen to its lowest level in six years.



The Government cannot blame plunging business confidence on the bushfire crisis or the

Coronavirus when the numbers show business confidence and conditions have been weak

for some time now.



The NAB Monthly Business Survey shows that business confidence fell another two index

points in December, remaining well below its long-run average, while business conditions

fell one index point to be three points below its long-run average.



Business confidence has been weak because the Morrison Government in its seventh year

spends all its time spinning, pork-barrelling and playing politics instead of coming up with a

plan to support the economy and boost business investment.



When Labor, the business community, the Reserve Bank and other experts are calling out

for measured, responsible and proportionate stimulus to support the economy, the Prime

Minister and Treasurer just sit on their hands and make excuses.



The Governmentâ€™s failure to plan means we face the current economic uncertainties and

challenges not from a position of strength but from a position of weakness.
