STAGE FOUR RESTRICTIONS ON INDUSTRY

Federal Labor acknowledges that the stage four restrictions limiting the  operation of industry in Victoria, while following the necessary health advice,  will be difficult for many businesses and workers.

Businesses forced to shut as a result of these changes or who suffer significant  losses can apply for a $5 - 10,000 disaster grant depending on their location.

Despite hope for a vaccine, COVID outbreaks in other states across the country  are threatening, and it is incumbent on the federal government to be prepared  and have the necessary support ready.

The Federal Government can’t leave all heavy lifting to the Victorian State  Government.

Of significant concern, JobKeeper and JobSeeker payments are due to be  reduced shortly after the next six weeks of the stage four restrictions, and we  call upon the Government to take another look at the plan and tailor the support  programs to the economic conditions.

As the health and economic situation in Victoria worsens, we again call on the  Federal Government to consider our suggestion for accountant vouchers to  advise businesses on the appropriate economic support available to them.

It is in all Australians interests that Victorian industry get through this in the best  possible shape. With so many national supply chains reliant on Victoria it is  vitally important that we have adequate federal support.
