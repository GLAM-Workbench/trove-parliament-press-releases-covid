Ã¢ÂÂ¯MORRISON GOVERNMENT FAILS TO DELIVER DISABILITY ROYAL

COMMISSION PRIVACY PROTECTION PROMISE



The Morrison Government has sent a message to Australians wanting to confidentially tell their

story to the Disability Royal Commission: you are not a priority.



The Government decided not to prioritise a Bill it introduced to the Senate this week that would

have introduced much needed privacy protections requested by Commissioner Ronald

Sackville months ago and supported by the disability organisations and advocates, Labor and

the crossbench.



This means that many people with disability will not be able to share their stories with the

Commission for at least another 6 weeks before the Parliament sits again to allow the passage

of this legislation which would give them confidence to come forward.



Labor wrote to the Government last week urging it to address this issue by Thursday after the

Attorney-General Christian Porter said he had instructed his Department to ‘work swiftly’ on the



amendments last October.



This is the latest frustration for a Royal Commission stonewalled by a Government that refuses

to even acknowledge several letters from Commissioner Sackville asking for a 17-month

extension due to the impact of COVID-19.



The extension is now even more pressing given the Government’s failure to deliver timely

amendments to deliver these important privacy protections.



It seems the Morrison Government is happy to leave people with a disability in the lurch and let

the clock run out on the Disability Royal Commission before many Australians have an

opportunity to make a submission.
