MEDIA RELEASE  ADAM BANDT 9 SEP 2020 GENERAL SHARE

Greens announce new party room lineup to push for Green New Deal and compassionate pandemic recovery

Leader of the Australian Greens, Adam Bandt MP has announced the lineup of his new Greens team, following Lidia Thorpe's first Party Room Meeting as a Senator.

The reshuffle is the most significant since Adam Bandt MP was elected leader, reflecting new talent within Party Room and the rapidly shifting political context in the age of COVID-19.

Senator Lidia Thorpe now holds the First Nations, Justice and Sports portfolios, while the meeting also confirmed the creation of a new Anti-Racism portfolio to be held by Senator Mehreen Faruqi.

Senator Nick McKim holds the newly created Economic Justice portfolio, which will lead the charge against the critical levels of economic inequality laid bare by the coronavirus induced recession. Senator McKim will also take on the Treasury and Finance portfolios.

Peter Whish-Wilson is now Agriculture & Rural Affairs spokesperson, with his first-hand experience of being a grower in the climate crisis to provide valuable insight for the party's pitch to those living outside the major cities.

Senator Rachel Siewert will take charge of the Health portfolio, formerly held by Richard Di Natale, in recognition of the inextricable link between community and health services.

Finally, Senator Janet Rice will lead on Foreign Affairs and Multiculturalism.

"This is the team we need to take on the unprecedented challenge created by the coronavirus crisis," Adam Bandt MP said.

"With the Liberals avoiding discussion of anything other than COVID, and Labor siding with the Liberals on tax cuts and the climate crisis, this refreshed Greens team will bring in new perspectives and ideas, while also acknowledging the incredible work being done by all our MPs.

"If it wasn't clear before the pandemic, it's undeniable now. Business as usual has failed, leading to soaring economic inequality, a rapidly heating planet and a jobs crisis that has created Depression era-dole queues.

"We need to urgently implement a Green New Deal and this is the team to do it."
