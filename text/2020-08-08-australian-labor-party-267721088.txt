RECOVERY MUST BE RENEWABLES FOCUSED



A COVID-19 recovery plan which brings forward investment in new renewable

projects and builds on Australia’s huge potential as a clean energy

manufacturer will create tens of thousands of new jobs, stimulate regional

economies, deliver cheaper power prices, and help to tackle climate change.



Scott Morrison and his Government need to deliver a policy which incentivises

renewable energy investment and modernises the Australian economy.



To ignore the massive potential of renewable energy and renewables-related

industry is exactly the type of ideological bias that has undermined progress

under the Coalition Government.



After seven years and 19 energy policy attempts, this Government has no

national energy policy and they continue an anti-renewables agenda, refusing

to capitalise on the huge benefits that clean energy can bring to Australian

households and businesses.



Even before the COVID-19 crisis renewable energy investment had collapsed

by more than 50 per cent in 2019. As the RBA has recently noted this was due

to the Morrison Government’s lack of energy policy.





Australians know the future is renewables; that’s exactly what the business

sector, including the Australian Industry Group, is telling us and it’s exactly what

the Government’s Technology Roadmap concludes.
