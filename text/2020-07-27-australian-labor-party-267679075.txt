CHRIS BOWEN MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR HEALTH  MEMBER FOR MCMAHON



PASSING OF DR HARRY NESPOLON

Labor is deeply saddened by the death of Royal Australian College of General  Practitioners (RACGP) President Dr Harry Nespolon.

Over a long career in general practice and medical advocacy, Harry was a  fierce advocate for Australia’s GPs.

He fought for GPs and their patients without fear or favour, culminating in his  term as RACGP President.

Most recently, Harry played a vital role in Australia’s COVID-19 response,  including advocacy for Medicare telehealth items that have proved so important  during the pandemic.

He continued to fight for better health for all Australians as recently as last  week.

Labor’s thoughts are with Harry’s family, friends, colleagues and patients. Like  them, we will miss him.
