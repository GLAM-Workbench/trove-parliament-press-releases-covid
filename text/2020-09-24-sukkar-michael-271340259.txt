INSOLVENCY REFORMS TO SUPPORT   SMALL BUSINESSES RECOVERY  The Morrison Government will undertake the most significant reforms to Australia’s insolvency  framework in 30 years as part of our economic recovery plan to keep businesses in business and  Australians in jobs.

The reforms, which draw on key features from Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United  States, will help more small businesses restructure and survive the economic impact of COVID-19. As  the economy continues to recover, it will be critical that distressed businesses have the necessary  flexibility to either restructure or to wind down their operations in an orderly manner.

Key elements of the reforms include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The introduction of a new debt restructuring process for incorporated businesses with liabilities  of less than $1 million, drawing on some key features of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy model in the  United States.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Moving from a rigid one-size-fits-all “creditor in possession” model to a more flexible “debtor in  possession” model which will allow eligible small businesses to restructure their existing debts  while remaining in control of their business.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A rapid twenty business day period for the development of a restructuring plan by a small  business restructuring practitioner, followed by fifteen business days for creditors to vote on the  plan.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A new, simplified liquidation pathway for small businesses to allow faster and lower cost  liquidation.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Complementary measures to ensure the insolvency sector can respond effectively both in the  short and long term to increased demand and to meet the needs of small business.

The reforms will cover around 76 per cent of businesses subject to insolvencies today, 98 per cent of  whom who have less than 20 employees.

Together, these measures will reposition our insolvency system to reduce costs for small businesses,  reduce the time they spend during the insolvency process, ensure greater economic dynamism, and  ultimately help more small businesses get to the other side of the crisis.

On 22 March 2020, the Government announced temporary regulatory measures to help financially  distressed businesses get to the other side of COVID-19. On 7 September 2020 the Government  announced a further extension of this relief to 31 December 2020.  The new processes will be available  for small businesses from 1 January 2021.

Further information on the measures can be found on the Treasury website.

Ends.
