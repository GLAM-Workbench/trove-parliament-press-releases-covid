GREENS CONDEMN PLANS TO FAST TRACK $1BN SPEND ON MISSILES

31/03/2021  Australian Greens Peace and Disarmament Spokesperson Jordon Steele-John  has condemned the government’s efforts to fast forward the establishment of its  planned $1 billion Sovereign Guided Weapons Enterprise as an irresponsible  use of public money and an abrogation of our responsibility to work towards  peace in our region.

“Spending $1 billion of public money on missiles will not make Australia safer.  In fact, this move only serves to undermine peace and stability in our region.”

“This plan will lock us in to spending billions of dollars over the next two  decades on a missile program that is fundamentally flawed and needlessly  escalate tensions in our region.

“The only tangible outcome this program will produce is a couple of shiny  rockets for major party politicians to stand next to in a photo so they can look  like they are doing something.

“To achieve peace in the Asia-Pacific region we must direct our efforts towards  tackling the climate crisis and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, not more  on dangerous weapons.

“Instead of spending billions on missiles, we should be spending it on climate  change and public health action in our region.”
