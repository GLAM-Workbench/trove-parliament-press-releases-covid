SCOTT MORRISON MUST LEARN FROM AGED CARE MISTAKES

The Morrison Government must urgently establish protocols with all state and  territory governments that would ensure aged care response centres could be  established up immediately if required to help avoid the tragedy that is  occurring in Victorian nursing homes.

Labor has written to the Prime Minister seeking assurances this work is  underway so we never again see the tragic consequences of inaction and  delays.

The Commonwealth has responsibility for aged care and the Prime Minister  cannot again be left flat footed if there are further outbreaks in aged care in  other states and territories.

The Morrison Government stood up the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre  two weeks after the first COVID-19 cases were reported in Victorian nursing  homes.

Nothing can bring back the lost weeks when the Morrison Government could  have done more to prevent the tragedy in Victoria, but it can do the work now to  make sure this doesn’t happen again.

After failing to learn from outbreaks of COVID-19 in New South Wales nursing  homes, the Morrison Government cannot make the same mistake.

We have seen the devastating impact of COVID-19 outbreaks in aged care in  Australia and across the globe.

Why was the Morrison Government not better prepared for outbreaks that  would impact our nation’s most vulnerable?



Australia’s aged care system was broken before the COVID-19 pandemic and  this is only putting extra stress on the system.

The Morrison Government must act now for our most vulnerable older  Australians.
