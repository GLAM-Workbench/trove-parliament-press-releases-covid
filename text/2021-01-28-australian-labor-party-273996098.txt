SHADOW MINISTER FOR HEALTH AND AGEING

MEMBER FOR HINDMARSH



APPOINTMENT AS SHADOW MINISTER FOR HEALTH AND AGEING



I’m honoured to be appointed as Shadow Minister for Health and Ageing,

especially at this critical time as Australia grapples with a once in a century

pandemic and a crisis in aged care.



Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, my friend Chris Bowen has worked

constructively with the Government to put the health of Australians first, while

pointing out clearly where the Government could do better. Chris’ approach to the

pandemic has been the right one, I intend to continue this approach.



As Ageing Minister in the Gillard Government we invested almost $4 billion in new

arrangements for the aged care sector under the Living Longer Living Better

package. It focused on better services for dementia, and building a home care

service that, under Scott Morrison’s Government, has been severely neglected.



It’s been two years since the Royal Commission said the first thing the

Government needed to do was fix the home care waitlist. Two years on and there

are still over 100,000 older Australians waiting for home care for which they’ve

been approved. Julie Collins has tirelessly advocated for senior Australians and I

intend to do the same.





I thank everyone I’ve worked with over my almost eight years in the climate change

and energy portfolio - business, unions, environmental groups and the many

Australians who are committed to preserving a safe climate for their children and

embracing the job opportunities of clean energy.



Scott Morrison and his Government are as isolated and divided as ever on climate

change. I’ve worked closely with Chris Bowen for many years on climate policy and

know he’ll do a magnificent job in the portfolio.
