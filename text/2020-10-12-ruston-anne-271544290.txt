$5 million boost for Food Relief providers

The Morrison Government is providing an additional $5 million in Food Relief funding to give a  boost to the sector to continue delivering services throughout the coronavirus pandemic.

Minister for Families and Social Services Anne Ruston said the Government was committed to  responding to emerging demand and supporting all Australians doing it tough.

“This additional funding brings the Morrison Government’s total investment in Food Relief during  the pandemic to $25 million across three our national providers - Foodbank, OzHarvest and  SecondBite,” Minister Ruston said.

“As part of our response to the pandemic we set aside $200 million for the Community Support  Package and I established a sector-led National Coordination Group to advise me of need on the  ground.

“We understand many Australians who have lost their jobs or have reduced wages through no fault  of their own and many are reaching out for Government support for the first time in their lives. We  are committed to making sure the emergency support they need is available when they need it.

“Pleasingly, in recent weeks Government-funded Emergency Relief providers have reported a  decrease in demand for client services on a national basis.”

The additional funding was signed off last month following advice from the National Coordination  Group and is expected to be with Food Relief providers within days.

More information about Food Relief and Emergency Relief service providers is available on the  Department of Social Services website.
