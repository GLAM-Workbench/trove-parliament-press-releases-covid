STATES TURN TO ABC FOR EDUCATION



The value of a trusted national broadcaster has once again been affirmed with

State Governments turning to the ABC to support education provision during

the Coronavirus crisis.



Yesterday the ABC announced that, working in partnership with states and

territories, and with initial financial assistance from the New South Wales and

Victorian education departments, it will provide curriculum-aligned content and

mini-lessons for primary and secondary school children over its ABC ME

television channel and make them available on ABC online and catch-up

platforms.



This will support children’s home-schooling, particularly the three per cent of

Australian households with children under the age of 15 who do not have

internet at home.





It will also complement the ABC’s existing suite of educational programs and

resources which Australian children know and enjoy.



The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is placing the education system,

teachers, parents, carers and children under great pressure.



Ensuring every family with children has quality resources to support continuity

of learning is a challenge for which the ABC is uniquely placed to assist, given

its Charter obligations to provide programs of an educational nature.



Labor congratulates the ABC for innovating to support young Australians at this

time of unprecedented uncertainty.



There can be no doubt. From drought to bushfires, floods and now coronavirus,

the extraordinary events of 2019-20 reveal how reckless, ideological and short-sighted calls to cut or privatise the ABC are.
