Growth in demand for job-ready degrees

Job-ready university degrees that will be cheaper next year attracted the highest growth in  student numbers in 2020.

More Australians applied to study vocational university degrees in 2020, with growth in  applications of:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Agriculture, environmental and related studies up 10.8 per cent  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Information technology up 9.8 per cent

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Natural and physical sciences up 3.1 per cent, and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Education up 2 per cent.

From 2021, those degrees will be cheaper for students under the Morrison Government’s  Job-ready Graduates package.

Applications for undergraduate courses increased by 0.9 per cent for the 2020 academic  year, following falls of 1.3 per cent in 2019 and 2.6 per cent in 2018.

Minister for Education Dan Tehan said the Undergraduate Applications, Offers and  Acceptances 2020 report published today reflected data from before the COVID-19  pandemic.

“This data is from another time because we know the COVID-19 recession will lead to even  more Australians applying for university in 2021,” Mr Tehan said.

“Our Government has taken action to meet that demand by creating up to 30,000 additional  places at university for Australian students next year through our Job-ready Graduates  package and this year’s budget, as well as more than $250 million for 50,000 short course  places next year.

“Our reforms will make it cheaper to study in areas of expected job growth, and the report  shows growth in applications was strongest for vocationally oriented courses, which means  students are already choosing to study in national priority areas.

“Universities in regional Australia recorded the biggest growth in applications of 3.3 per cent,  and the Job-ready Graduates package will provide faster growth in the number of student  places at those universities as well as an additional $400 million in support for regional  students and regional universities.”

Introduction

Purpose of the report  To identify trends in numbers of applications, offers and acceptances and the characteristics of  applicants, which are leading indicators of the response of universities to the demand for higher  education in 2020.

This report analyses data on applications, offers and acceptances for university admission for the  first semester of the 2020 academic year, as of 14 May 2020.

Overview of the data  Data are derived from the University Applications and Offers Data Collection. The data refer to  domestic undergraduate student applications, offers and acceptances as of 14 May 2020. It consists  of data on:

Ã¯ÂÂ· applications and offers processed through Tertiary Admissions Centres (TACs), and   Ã¯ÂÂ· applications made directly to universities and resulting offers.

The full data is available in visual analytics form on the department’s website, along with previous  Applications and offers reports and data at:  https://www.education.gov.au/undergraduate-applications-offers-and-acceptances-publications

In 2007, the Queensland government introduced an additional year of schooling before Year 1 with

only a half-cohort of students enrolling that year. As a result of the Queensland half-year cohort

effect, the number of Year 12 students in Queensland in 2019 was around 30 per cent less than the

previous year leading to lower applications for higher education among Queensland school leavers

in 2020. Figures in this report showing the change in applications between 2019 and 2020 exclude

applications and offers from the Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre (QTAC) due to the need to

compare ‘like with like’. Inclusion of QTAC data would have led to a national fall of 1.2 per cent in

applications and a 1.7 per cent reduction in offers in 2020.

Acknowledgements  The department would like to thank all officers of TACs and universities for submitting high quality  applications and offers data for the 2020 academic year.

Highlights

Application numbers  Ã¯ÂÂ· The actual number of individuals applying either through a TAC (excluding Queensland TAC  applicants) or directly for a university place in 2020 was 287,528, an increase of 0.9 per cent on  the previous year. This follows a decrease of 1.3 per cent in 2019.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Direct applicants made up 38.1 per cent of total applicants in 2020.

Offer numbers  Ã¯ÂÂ· There were 237,126 unique offers made in 2020, an increase of 0.6 per cent on the previous  year. This follows a decrease of 1.5 per cent in 2019.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Direct offers accounted for 35.8 per cent of total offers in 2020.

Offer rate  Ã¯ÂÂ· The offer rate measures the way in which universities choose to respond to student demand.  Ã¯ÂÂ· In 2020 the offer rate was 82.5 per cent, down from 83.6 per cent in 2019 and 83.8 per cent in  2018.

Ã¯ÂÂ· On the other hand, fields of education that experienced the largest declines in applications were  Creative Arts (-5.8 per cent) and Management and Commerce (-5.1 per cent).   Ã¯ÂÂ· Society and Culture received the largest number of offers (58,941 or 24.9 per cent of total  offers). This was followed by Health (53,518 or 22.6 per cent of total offers).  Ã¯ÂÂ· Except Management and Commerce (-5.9 per cent) and Creative Arts (-5.0 per cent), all broad

fields of education recorded increases in offers in 2020. Agriculture, Environmental and Related  Studies recorded the largest increase in offers (13.8 per cent), followed by Information  Technology (10.1 per cent), Engineering and Related Technologies (5.3 per cent), Architecture  and Building (2.9 per cent), Education (2.3 per cent), Health (1.6 per cent), Society and Culture  (0.9 percent) and Natural and Physical Sciences (0.8 per cent).  Ã¯ÂÂ· Natural and Physical Sciences had the highest offer rate at 94.2 per cent, a decrease of 2.1

percentage points in 2020. Health had the lowest offer rate of 71.6 per cent in 2020. Engineering  and Related Technologies experienced the largest increase in the offer rate in 2020 of  3.5 percentage points to 86.9 per cent.

Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR)  Ã¯ÂÂ· The average ATAR of applicants receiving an offer decreased marginally from 77.4 in 2019 to  77.0 in 2020.

Table 2: Average ATAR for those receiving an offer, 2010- 2020





Ã¯ÂÂ· In 2020, 27.0 per cent of all offers made to applicants were for those with an ATAR of at least  70.05. Offers to applicants who achieved an ATAR above 90 accounted for 9.8 per cent of all  offers.

Ã¯ÂÂ· The share of offers for applicants in the ATAR band 50.00 or less remained steady at 2.5 per  cent, the same as in 2019.  Ã¯ÂÂ· The share of offers for applicants with no ATAR or who were non-Year 12 applicants was  60.5 per cent in 2020, up from 60.1 per cent in 2019.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Offer rates for applicants in the ATAR band 50.00 or less have increased from 41.1 per cent in

2014 to 53.3 per cent in 2020.   Ã¯ÂÂ· The offer rates for the top three ATAR bands (deciles) have remained relatively steady within a  range of 97 per cent to 99 per cent.    Ã¯ÂÂ· Note the likelihood of an applicant with a low ATAR receiving an offer has recorded a greater

increase than an applicant with a higher ATAR. In part, this is because offer rates for applicants  with a higher ATAR are starting from a higher base so there is less scope for an increase in offer  rates.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Fields of education with an above average share of offers for applicants in the ATAR band 90.00  or more were Engineering and Related Technologies (23.2 per cent), Natural and Physical  Sciences (18.7 per cent) and Management and Commerce (11.9 per cent).   Ã¯ÂÂ· Fields of education with an above average share of offers for applicants in the ATAR band 50.00  or less were Architecture and Building (4.5 per cent), Information Technology (4.1 per cent),

Education (3.8 per cent), Management and Commerce (3.4 per cent), Society and Culture (3.2  per cent) and Creative Arts (3.1 per cent).

Underrepresented groups  Ã¯ÂÂ· In 2020, applicants from a low SES background recorded a larger increase (2.8 per cent) in  applications than applicants from a medium SES background (0.8 per cent). However, applicants  from high SES backgrounds decreased by 0.1 per cent.

Ã¯ÂÂ· In 2020, offers to applicants from a low SES background increased by 2.1 per cent, followed by  those from a medium SES background (0.3 per cent) and high SES background (0.1 per cent).  Ã¯ÂÂ· Applicants from a low SES background were less likely to receive an offer. Their offer rate was  80.1 per cent compared with 81.9 per cent for applicants from a medium SES background and

84.9 per cent for applicants from a high SES background in 2020.   Ã¯ÂÂ· In 2020, applications from metropolitan residents increased by 0.7 per cent while applications  from non-metropolitan residents increased by 1.8 per cent.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Similarly, offers made to metropolitan applicants increased by 0.5 per cent compared with an

increase of 1.2 per cent in offers made to non-metropolitan applicants.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Applications from non-metropolitan residents were more likely to result in an offer compared  with applications from metropolitan residents, 84.3 per cent and 81.9 per cent respectively.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Nationally, there were 6296 applicants from an Indigenous background, an increase of 7.7

per cent compared with 2019. This represents 2.2 per cent of all applications.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Offers to Indigenous applicants increased by 6.9 per cent to 4987 in 2020.  Ã¯ÂÂ· 79.1 per cent of applicants from an Indigenous background had attracted an offer in 2020. This is

a decrease of 0.6 percentage points compared with the same period last year. The offer rate for  non-Indigenous applicants was 82.9 per cent in 2020, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points over  2019.

University groups  Ã¯ÂÂ· The Regional Universities Network (RUN) and Australian Technology Network (ATN) recorded  positive growth in applications, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent, respectively in 2020. On the other  hand, Innovative Research Universities (IRU) (-1.1 per cent) and the Group of Eight (Go8)

(-0.8 per cent) recorded decreases in applications.

Ã¯ÂÂ· In terms of offers, a similar pattern was observed among the university groups. ATN (2.5 per  cent) and RUN (1.7 per cent) recorded positive growth in offers. Go8 (-3.6 per cent) and IRU (-0.1  per cent) observed decreases in offers.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Applications to Go8 universities and ATN universities were least likely to receive an offer in 2020,  offer rates of 71.7 per cent and 76.7 per cent respectively, reflecting the higher entry  requirements at these universities.

Ã¯ÂÂ· The offer rate decreased for all university groups, except IRU, in 2020: The Go8 universities (-2.1  percentage points), followed by RUN universities (-1.4 percentage points) and ATN universities   (-0.3 percentage points). The IRU universities recorded an increase in offer rate (0.9 percentage  points).

Data Qualifications  The data referred to in this report contains applications and offers for domestic undergraduate  university places through TACs and universities as of 14 May 2019.

It should be noted that:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Applications and offers data in this report refer to TAC data and applications made directly to  universities.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Only applications made to Table A institutions and University of Notre Dame Australia (Table B)  are included in the analysis.

Ã¯ÂÂ· The data does not include applications from overseas students.

Ã¯ÂÂ· All references to “applications” (in TAC data) in this report relate to highest preference  applications.

Ã¯ÂÂ· A small proportion of applicants make applications to more than one TAC resulting in some  double counting of applicants.

Ã¯ÂÂ· All references to “2020” in this report relate to the 2020 submission through TACs and the data  submission on applications made directly to universities as of 14 May for the first semester of  the 2020 academic year.

Ã¯ÂÂ· All references to “Year 12” applicants in this report relate to applicants who attempted an  ACACA Year 12 program or the International Baccalaureate in the year of application.

Ã¯ÂÂ· While completing Year 12 and gaining a tertiary entrance score is the most common way to gain  entry to university, TACs and universities take a number of other qualifications into  consideration, particularly for adults applying who have not recently completed Year 12. Some  pathways to gaining entry to a university degree include sitting the Special Tertiary Admissions  Test (STAT), articulating from certificate and/or diploma level studies in vocational education  and training (VET), university bridging or foundation programs and previous higher education  (completed or commenced).

Ã¯ÂÂ· In 2007, the Queensland government introduced an additional year of schooling before Year 1  with only a half-cohort of students enrolling that year. As a result of the Queensland half-year  cohort effect, the number of Year 12 students in Queensland in 2019 was around 30 per cent  less than the previous year leading to lower applications for higher education among  Queensland school leavers in 2020. Figures in this report showing the change in applications  between 2019 and 2020 exclude applications and offers from the Queensland Tertiary  Admissions Centre (QTAC) due to the need to compare ‘like with like’ as a result of the  Queensland half-year cohort effect. Inclusion of QTAC data would have led to a national fall of  1.2 per cent in applications and a 1.7 per cent reduction in offers in 2020, noting this is like  comparing ‘apples with oranges’.

Ã¯ÂÂ· 2015 applications and offers data were affected by the ‘half-year’ Year 12 cohort in Western  Australia (WA). It relates to the effect of the ‘half-year’ cohort arose due to the Western  Australian State Government changing the starting age for school children in 2003. The change

Undergraduate applications, offers and acceptances 2020

was legislated by the WA School Education Act of 1999. Until 2003, children began Year 1 at the  beginning of the calendar year when they turned six. From 2003, children began Year 1 if they  turned six between 1 July of the previous year and 30 June of the year they started school. This  policy change was introduced as a one-off. That is, there was no staggered implementation  across years, which meant that in 2003 only children born between 1 January 1997 and 30 June  1997 started school. This small cohort worked its way through the school system reaching Year  12 in 2014. The Tertiary Institutions Service Centre (TISC - the TAC in WA) estimated that it is  more likely that the number of students with an ATAR was around 60 per cent of the size of a  normal cohort of students. This is considerably impacted WA’s university application numbers  for the 2015 academic year.
