MEDIA RELEASE  COVID IS NOT A CLIMATE POLICY



30 November 2020

Greens Leader, Adam Bandt, says the latest reported emissions drop, driven by  the Covid-19 shutdowns, should provide no cover for the Morrison Government.

Australia’s reduction targets are some of the weakest in the developed world and  are under renewed pressure after the election of Joe Biden who has called on  nations to lift 2030 targets.

Indeed, when volatile land clearing figures are excluded, Australia’s emissions are

actually above 2005 levels.

“Covid is not a climate policy,” Bandt said.

“As Australia emerges from the worst of the pandemic, emissions are set to rise  again because the government has no climate plan.”

“Without stronger, science-based 2030 targets and a plan to phase out coal, gas  and oil, emissions are set to rise again as we get the pandemic under control.



“One of the biggest drops in emissions, caused by the lockdown, was transport.  While the UK is phasing out combustion engine sales in a decade, Australia is  either doing nothing, or in some states even worse by bringing in EV taxes.

“The pandemic is not an acceptable means of reducing emissions.”



“Joe Biden will host a climate conference in his first 100 days as President, and  that will be followed by the Glasgow climate summit. Australia has a very narrow  window to turn our ship around and lift 2030 targets, or we will find ourselves out in  the cold with Saudi Arabia and Russia.

“The US and Europe are gearing up for a race to the top, with huge opportunities in  booming markets for renewable energy, hydrogen and green metals and  manufactured goods.

“Our biggest markets for coal and gas in Japan, China and South Korea are all  ramping up their emissions targets too. Australia’s ‘gas-led’ recovery is an act of  economic ruin."
