CONNECTING & ACTIVATING THE  NORTHERN TERRITORY

Tuesday 24 November 2020 DARWIN,  AUSTRALIA



OE&E - Check against delivery.



Kaya Wanju - Hello and welcome.

I’d like to start by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land we meet today, the Larrakia

people, and pay my respects to their Elders past and present.

I also extend my respects to all Indigenous people here today, and to all elders in attendance,

no matter where you have travelled from to attend here this evening.

Can I also thank the Northern Land Council for hosting this event tonight - and arranging

f or us to meet here - to have this important conversation.

In particular, want to acknowledge the Chair, Sammy Bush-Blanasi, and Chief Executive

Officer, Marion Scrymgour.

2020 has presented us all with challenges like never before - but as we meet here tonight -

we can be proud in the resilience of our people - who have survived many challenges over

65,000 years - and we continue to thrive - we continue to grow our individual, family and

community strength - and we continue to contribute to the rich fabric of this nation.

Coronavirus has seen devastation around the world. Here in Australia we have been lucky to

have managed the pandemic and it’s impacts - and I’m proud to say that our collective efforts

- from government and community - has ensured that COVID-19 didn’t reach our remote

communities. In fact into our communities across the geographic diverse country of ours

This is a tremendous achievement for which we should be proud of and equally all share credit

for an incredible outcome.

It is also a demonstration of the power of partnership and a strong relationship between

Community and Government.

When governments walk alongside with Indigenous Australians - we realise better policy

Connecting & Activating the NT 2

development, better programme delivery and importantly better outcomes for our people

through working together - co designing the solutions that work.

Tonight, I want to set out my vision for working in partnership with you - here in the Northern

Territory. I believe that we have unlimited potential before us.

That together we can unlock, connect and activate new prosperity for our people.

But for us to do so - we need to commit ourselves to a genuine partnership - one that extends

beyond decision making to co design, implementation, responsibility and accountability on the

ground.

The Morrison Government is committed to this approach. We’re demonstrating this through the

new National Agreement on Closing the Gap and the co-design of an Indigenous Voice - so

that voices everywhere are heard between Darwin, Northern Territory communities and

Canberra.

To Close the Gap, to empower Indigenous Australians and to realise our full potential will

require strengthening existing partnerships and establishing new ones.

We  have to challenge the status quo - reimagine norms - and challenge ourselves to do

different and better.

NORTHERN TERRITORY GOVERNMENT

The new National Agreement on Closing the Gap was developed in genuine partnership

between all Australian governments and Indigenous Australians, represented by the Coalition

of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peak Organisations.

It heralds a new era of shared decision making - shared responsibility - and shared

accountability.

The implementation of this National Agreement across all parties must honour this

commitment. This is particularly relevant here in the Northern Territory.

I congratulate the Gunner Government on their re-election earlier this year and in particular

The Hon Selena Ubo Attorney General; Minister for Justice; Minister for Treaty and Local

Decision Making; Minister for Aboriginal Affairs: Minister for Parks and Rangers who I look

forward to working with on a New Direction for the Northern Territory.

The Gunner Government now have an opportunity to set out how they will deliver on their

responsibilities under the National Agreement on Closing the Gap and importantly, beyond this

Connecting & Activating the NT 3

to empower Indigenous Australians throughout the NT.

If we are to achieve meaningful change and better outcomes for our people we need to hold all

governments accountable, and while the Commonwealth will always play a significant role here

in the Northern Territory - it is time for people to hold the relevant elected governments

responsible for their actions, and unfortunately in some cases, inaction.

As we near the conclusion of the Northern Territory Remote Aboriginal Investment, we’re

committed to working with the Northern Territory Government to establish a new way of

working - one based in genuine partnership - between both governments and Indigenous

Australians.

Since 2009, the Commonwealth government has provided in excess of $280 million for police

operations and infrastructure here in the NT - $207 million of this was through the Northern

Territory Remote Aboriginal Investment programme.

From the offset of this agreement it was not anticipated that the Australian Government would

provide further funding beyond its expiration.

The delivery of policing in the Northern Territory remains an NT Government responsibility -

the NT Government needs to articulate their plan for the provision of police operations beyond

the conclusion of Northern Territory Remote Aboriginal Investment programme.

The Commonwealth’s role will be explored through the Northern Territory Remote Aboriginal

Investment programme, End of Term Review, planned to commence early next year.

Our remote communities should be able to have confidence in their government’s commitment

to keeping them safe - it is the first duty of government - and recent comments reflected in the

media are disappointing.

The solution to our challenges isn’t merely turning to Canberra - we must start here at home,

with each other, with our communities and with our regions- we must look at new ways of

working that allow joint decision making and underpinned by a genuine commitment to co-designing the solutions to the challenges that continue to exist.

This is an essential connection - one critical to establish a safe environment where we can

prosper as a nation but more importantly as the people of the Northern Territory to affect a

better future for our children and or grandchildren. It must be our collective legacy.

And where critical and key service delivery is failing, we must look to new partnerships to

ensure that no one is left behind.

NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND COUNCILS

This brings me to the role of Land Councils.

Land Councils have been and continue to be - a key partner for ensuring the activation of the

Northern Territory.

You played a critical role in the response to COVID-19.

Through the Aboriginal Benefits Account, we unlocked $10 million across the Territory’s four

Land Councils to address immediate infrastructure and travel expenses associated with people

returning to homelands.

It is a demonstration that you - the people on the ground - know what needs to be done - and

how it should be done.

Supporting the role of Land Councils and ensuring that you have the capacity to deliver for our

people is such a critical component of what we’re trying to achieve.

Tonight, I’m proud to announce that I will sign off on a Land Council proposal to unlock $100

million from the ABA to deliver job creating projects through investment in infrastructure and

projects that will ensure long term economic opportunity and viability of the Indigenous estate.

Over two tranches, the first being $60 million, we will be -

Ã¯ÂÂ· Investing in existing Indigenous community businesses so they can adapt and deliver.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Investing in Aboriginal-owned infrastructure to connect people to economic

opportunities, including pastoral, tourism, gas and mining opportunities.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Building the skills of men and women on Country through rangers, learning on Country

programs and workplace experiences.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Investing in small-scale infrastructure projects to create jobs and improve the potential

of Aboriginal land, such as fencing, water infrastructure and homelands upgrades.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Maximising the ABA investment through co-investment and co-ordination with other

government funding streams and contributions from the corporate and philanthropic

sectors

The first tranche will focus on immediate COVID-19 relief and job creation, and the second

tranche will unlock and activate Indigenous-led projects across the Territory, in line with the

principles I just outlined.

Connecting & Activating the NT 5

I want to see our partnership with Indigenous Australians through the Land Councils extend

beyond this investment I’ve announced tonight.

It is unacceptable that so many Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory live in over-crowded and inadequate housing.

This is despite the Commonwealth committing to providing the Northern Territory with $550

million over five years to deliver 1,950 new bedrooms, equivalent to 650 houses, in remote

NT communities.

The Northern Territory Government’s roll out of these houses is slow - and it is

unacceptable.

The NT Government is responsible for housing and essential services.

People in remote communities should expect their housing services to be provided - just as

they would in any other location in Australia.

The fact that this is not happening is a disgrace - and in the year 2020 - and looking ahead

to 2021 - something that neither I nor the Northern Territory Government should allow to

happen.

I am serious when I say - where we have failings - we must explore new ways of working.

To this end, I note that the Land Councils are continuing to develop a proposal which would

see a direct partnership established with the Commonwealth for the provision of housing

services in the NT - led by the Central Land Council.

We don’t need to accept the current situation as the only option.

And we should explore all options that are bedded in genuine partnership with Indigenous

Australians - people who live in these communities - who are raising families - and who are

being let down through inaction.

There is no lack of funding or resources - and in fact - this is the last of the jurisdictions to

benefit from an ongoing partnership with the Commonwealth in respect to remote housing.

The NT Government, as the responsible jurisdiction, have signed the new National Agreement

on Closing the Gap, which for the first time establishes a housing target - aiming for 88 per

cent of Indigenous Australians to be in appropriate (not overcrowded) housing by 2031.

To achieve this we have to get to work.

Last month, I announced a $150 million equity injection into Indigenous Business Australia’s

Indigenous Home Ownership Programme.

This is an acknowledgment that Indigenous Australians have aspirations of home ownership

which I see reflected in the broader Australian society.

It is an investment that recognises the importance of having equity in a home - and the

programme ensures that we can reduce or remove barriers to home ownership for

Indigenous Australians.

A milestone has been reached in the Government’s efforts to enable home ownership on

Indigenous held land.

For the first time, a Tiwi Island Traditional Owner family has purchased their home outright,

having paid off their mortgage with IBA.

In April 2009, Jennifer and Brian Clancy were approved for a loan from IBA to construct a

home on Indigenous held land at Pickertaramoor on Melville Island.

Their loan was the first Home Ownership on Indigenous Land program loan approved.

The home enabled them to live within their homeland, close to secure employment and

provided a home for their family

On 30 September 2020, they made their final mortgage payment and now own their home

outright.

The Clancy’s are the first family to own their own home on Indigenous held land in the

Northern Territory.

Jenifer and Brian are here tonight - and I congratulate them on this great achievement.

I want our people to have aspiration - and to look to home ownership as a means to

securing their future - and I note that there are a number of other proposals on the table that

empower Indigenous Australians to own their own home, which I am more than willing to

explore.

Again, we don’t need to settle for the status quo. We can dream bigger. And we can realise

our aspirations.

ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

Last year I addressed the Northern Australia Economic Development Forum, where I

Connecting & Activating the NT 7

discussed the importance of land security - and resolving land claims here in the NT.

Indigenous Australians having control and say over the use of their land is critical. It is the

key to unlocking the economic opportunity here in the NT.

Tomorrow I’ll travel to Jabiru to meet with the Mirarr Traditional Owners, and discuss the

transition of the town from a mining centre to bucket list tourism destination.

In August, the Government passed the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory)

Amendment (Jabiru) Bill 2020 - a huge milestone for Jabiru and the Mirarr people in this

journey.

Summing up the debate in Parliament I said:

This bill is an important step, as I said, to the return of their land in Jabiru and

towards the town's bright future as the gateway to Kakadu National Park.

The Australian government has made a $216 million commitment to revitalise Jabiru

and Kakadu to ensure their future as world-class tourist destinations, as the member

for Lingiari mentioned this morning.

Our investment will herald a new era of economic opportunity for the region,

benefiting not only the Mirarr people but also the community and the Northern

Territory economy.

This bill supports the Mirarr in leading the transition of Jabiru from a mining town,

which they opposed, to a tourism town via a new township lease.



This is land security. This is self-determination. This is economic security. This is

empowerment.

Indigenous Australians having the say over the use of their land, and ensuring that there are

long-term considerations that will help develop economic opportunity over decades.

This is working in genuine partnership. This is government connecting with Traditional

Owners to empower. It is unlocking the potential here in the NT.

I want to see Indigenous Australians, not only having a greater say over the use of their land,

but also being in a position to leverage economic opportunity.

Our $216 million commitment to revitalise Jabiru and Kakadu is just one of these

Connecting & Activating the NT 8

opportunities.

I’m working closely with my colleagues, the Hon Sussan Ley MP, Minister for the

Environment on this project; and also the Hon Keith Pitt MP, Minister for Resources, Water

and Northern Australia.

Minister Pitt is passionate about the potential of the NT, and announced in this years’ Budget,

an additional $28.3 million to develop five Strategic Basins — including the Beetaloo Basin in

the Northern Territory. Minister Pitt stated recently”

“Development of gas reserves in the Beetaloo Basin has the potential to generate

billions of dollars for the Territory economy and over 6,000 jobs at a time when the

region needs to make the most of every opportunity it gets to create jobs and attract

investment.”

It is essential that Indigenous Australians are actively engaged in such projects, and I know

that Minister Pitt wants to ensure that our people have every opportunity to benefit from

these investments.

CONCLUSION

This is how we connect.

With each other, with government, with industry - to unlock and activate our potential here in

the Northern Territory.

We have before us tremendous opportunity - but to seize it fully and to realise our full

potential we must commit to a new way of working.

This means accountability for governments; clear direction and commitments to partner

with Indigenous Australians; establishing an environment where we can unlock the

potential of the Indigenous estate; and investing in the things that our people see key to

building a stronger future.

Tonight is our opportunity to acknowledge these things - and to commit to these principles.

The power is in this room tonight - and in every community right across the Territory. I want

our government and the Gunner Governemnt connecting and connected with Indigenous

Australians.

I want Indigenous Australians activating our potential.

And I want this new way of working to be the foundation for generations of economic

empowerment.

Thank you.
