GUARANTEEING ESSENTIAL SERVICES

The Morrison Government will continue to guarantee the essential services Australians rely on as part  of our Economic Recovery Plan for Australia.

This includes record funding for our schools, hospitals and aged care sector.

Health

The Budget will deliver record funding for health, with total spending of $93.8 billion in 2020-21, an  increase of almost 43 per cent since 2014-15.

This will ensure Australians can continue to access the essential medical, pharmaceutical and hospital  services they rely on.

The Government is committed to supporting the mental health and wellbeing of all Australians, and  has invested $5.7 billion in 2020-21, including funding for critical front line services and suicide  prevention.

This Budget also includes $376 million for new and amended listings on the PBS, including lifesaving  medicines to treat leukaemia, melanoma and Parkinson’s disease.

The Government is also contributing $50 million to the establishment of the Victorian Melanoma and  Clinical Trials Centre at the Alfred Hospital, helping researchers to better understand melanoma.

Aged care

During this crisis an additional $1.6 billion has already been provided to support the needs of  Australians in aged care.

This Budget will provide further support to older Australians who wish to stay at home for longer by  providing $1.6 billion for an additional 23,000 home care packages across all package levels.

The number of home care packages will have increased three-fold from around 60,300 in 2013 to  around 185,500 in 2021.

We are committed to delivering quality residential care with a further $11.3 million for training and  support for aged care providers and carers of people experiencing behavioural and psychological  symptoms of dementia.

Pensioners

To support our Age Pensioners during this crisis, the Government provided $750 Economic Support  Payments in April and July.

This Budget includes two additional $250 payments, the first to be provided from December 2020 and  the second from early 2021.

Disability

The Government is guaranteeing that National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) participants  receive the essential support they need.

The Government is providing a further $3.9 billion to the NDIS, to ensure Australians eligible for the  NDIS have access to the supports they need now and into the future.

Education

The Government is investing record funding in Australian schools to ensure all students have the  necessary skills for future study or work.

Recurrent annual funding for schools has increased from $13.8 billion in 2014 to $21.8 billion in 2020,  with a commitment of $310 billion in total recurrent funding from 2020 to 2030.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant changes to teaching and learning for young  Australians and the Government will provide an additional $146 million to improve the educational  outcomes of school leavers and disadvantaged students.

We have also guaranteed $18 billion in funding for all higher education institutions in 2020 in response  to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Government is extending this funding guarantee until 2023 to  support universities and higher education providers to continue to deliver quality teaching.

Veterans

This Budget delivers enhanced support for veterans and their families to maintain their wellbeing,  protect their mental health and assist them to transition successfully to civilian life.

This includes $94.3 million to improve mental health outcomes and ensure high-quality care for older  veterans and their families.

Eligible veteran income support recipients and concession card holders will also receive two additional  $250 Economic Support Payments from November 2020 and from early 2021.

Supporting communities

The Government is providing $220 million to support the delivery of critical front line services for  families.

This includes $133 million towards family and child support programs and $87.3 million towards  Family Law and Family Relationship Services.

Building on previous commitments to keep women and children safe and ensuring access to justice, we  will provide the Family and Federal Circuit Courts with an additional $10.2 million to manage the  impacts of COVID-19.

The Morrison Government is continuing to guarantee our essential services at a time when Australians  need them most.
