UPDATE - NEW ZEALAND TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS

On 24 January 2021, the New Zealand Government announced a case of COVID-19 detected  in the community. This morning, New Zealand authorities advised that the case detected is a  variant of concern. The case and subsequent exposure to the community are still under  investigation.

As a result, the Australian Government, based on advice from the Australian Health  Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC), has suspended green zone travel arrangements  with New Zealand for a minimum of 72 hours whilst more is learnt about the transmission.  This change comes into effect immediately (as of 1400 AEDT, 25 January 2021).

The decision has been taken out of an abundance of caution to reduce the risk of this variant,  which has been shown to spread more readily between individuals, entering the Australian  community.

All green safe travel zone passengers from New Zealand currently en route to Australia, or  with planned travel to Australia in the next 72 hours will be required to enter mandatory hotel  quarantine for up to 14 days on arrival or take other action based on the requirements of the  relevant State and Territory Governments.

It is recommended all passengers from New Zealand with a green safe travel zone flight  scheduled in the next 72 hours, reconsider their need to travel.

The Federal Government has advised all State and Territory governments and the New  Zealand Government of these changes.

Anyone who has arrived into Australia on a flight from New Zealand on or since January 14  is asked to isolate and arrange to get tested, and to remain in isolation until you have received  a negative test.
