Future of Work Partnership



The Morrison Government is working with businesses to improve training and create job  opportunities for Australians.

The Government is partnering with BHP to create opportunities for up to 1,000 people in  regional areas to study a higher education qualification or upgrade their skills to improve  their employability.

Through the BHP partnership, Australians will become more job-ready by gaining an  Undergraduate Certificate qualification through short courses, or participating in workplace  integrated learning through an Advanced Apprenticeship through the Future of Work  Partnership.

The Morrison Government is working with education providers and industry to ensure  Australians are learning the skills needed to succeed in the jobs that will power the  COVID-19 economic recovery.

To help develop the workforce of the future, the Government has:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Provided $2.8 billion Supporting Apprentices and Trainees wage subsidy that is  helping employers to retain their apprentices and trainees.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Created a $900 million National Priorities and Industry Linkage fund established to  enhance engagement between higher education and industry, with a strong focus on

STEM industries.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Provided $7 million to heavily subsidise short courses in areas of national priority.

Minister for Education Dan Tehan said the partnership was part of the Morrison  Government’s plan to invest in Australian brainpower, education and training to power our  economic recovery from COVID-19.

“To improve how universities and industry work together to educate job-ready graduates, our  Government is establishing a $900 million Industry Linkage Fund to incentivise university  engagement with industry and focus on creating more STEM-skilled and job-ready  graduates in areas of industry and community priority,” Mr Tehan said.

“In this year’s Budget, our Government provided $22.1 million for universities and employers  to provide advanced qualifications and industry cadetships for women in science,  technology, engineering and maths.

“We are also increasing the number of university places and short course places to support  increased demand from school leavers and provide more options for upskilling and reskilling  workers who have lost jobs due to COVID-19.”

The Morrison Government has already invested significantly to ensure that apprentices are  retained where possible and supported to re-engage if they lose their job as part of the  JobTrainer package.

Through the existing Supporting Apprentices and Trainees measure, as many as 90,000  businesses employing around 180,000 apprentices throughout Australia will continue to be  supported.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash said the BHP partnership would strengthen Australia’s vocational education and  training system.

“I welcome BHP’s commitment to training 2,500 new apprentices and additional $450 million  to boost Australia’s mining, equipment, technology and services sector,” Minister Cash said.

“Now more than ever, apprentices are critical to meeting the skills needs of Australian  employers. That’s why the Morrison Government continues to back apprentices and trainees  with $2.8 billion of support through our Supporting Apprentices and Trainees wage subsidy.

“Never before has it been so important for businesses who can, to continue to invest in their  future by taking on more apprentices.”

As Australia’s biggest export earner, the company has an important role to play in the  country’s economic recovery, BHP President Minerals Australia Edgar Basto said.

“This investment will help to create a pipeline of future talent in skilled roles in regional  communities across Australia,” Mr Basto said.

“Providing training opportunities for Australians of all ages and all walks of life is an  important contribution we can make to help Australia bounce back.”
