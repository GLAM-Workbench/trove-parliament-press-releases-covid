SENATOR PENNY WONG

LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY IN THE SENATE  SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  LABOR SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA



COVID-19



On Monday I woke feeling unwell.

Consistent with advice to all Australians, as a responsible precaution I self-isolated and did  not attend the Senate, pending medical advice.

Following medical advice, I was tested for COVID-19. That test has been returned  negative.

As soon as I am feeling well enough to travel I will return to Adelaide from Canberra.

I would like to thank the medical professionals who have been so helpful, and my  colleagues and the many members of the community who have sent me kind messages.

I would also like to thank Kristina Keneally, Katy Gallagher, Anne Urquhart and the entire  Labor Senate team for representing all the Australians who rely on Labor so effectively in  challenging circumstances on Monday.

Australia faces an enormous crisis. We mustnâ€™t have reason to look back and say that we  should have acted sooner on any part of this crisis.

We are all in this together.
