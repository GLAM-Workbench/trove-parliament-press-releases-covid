Economic Response to the Coronavirus  The Australian economy is resilient and we are well placed to navigate the  economic implications arising from the Coronavirus.

The Government has moved quickly to put in place health measures to protect  the Australian community from this complex and rapidly evolving challenge.

Today we announce an economic response totalling $17.6 billion across the  forward estimates, representing 0.9 per cent of annual GDP. This package will  protect the economy by maintaining confidence, supporting investment and  keeping people in jobs. Additional household income and business support will  flow through to strengthen the wider economy.

The Australian Government is acting decisively in the national interest to  address the potentially significant economic consequences of the virus, without  a permanent or structural impact on the budget balance.

OUR HEALTH SYSTEM IS WELL PREPARED TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY

The outbreak of the Coronavirus is a new, complex and rapidly evolving challenge with significant health  impacts. While the outbreak originated in China, significant outbreaks are now occurring in Italy, Iran and  South Korea with more than 100 countries reporting infections.

To date, cases in Australia have been relatively small in number, but the medical advice is that the  Coronavirus will continue to move through the Australian community.

Our health system is well prepared to manage an outbreak of the Coronavirus. We have a world-class  health system which has pandemic plans that are currently activated. The Government has put in place  strong measures to protect Australians, including activating the National Incident Room, releasing masks  from the National Medical Stockpile, enhancing border controls and imposing strict travel restrictions. The  Government will continue to respond as the situation develops.

The Government has committed an additional $2.4 billion to support our health system to manage any  further outbreak in Australia. The package provides support across primary care, aged care, hospitals and  research. It will ensure the capacity of our health system to effectively assess, diagnose and treat people  with the Coronavirus in a way that minimises its spread in the community and protects vulnerable  Australians. The Government has also committed to pay for half of all additional costs incurred by states  and territories in diagnosing and treating patients with, or suspected of having, the Coronavirus, and efforts  to minimise the spread of the virus.

HOW THE CORONAVIRUS WILL AFFECT THE GLOBAL AND AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIES

The Coronavirus outbreak not only affects people’s health and the health systems of the countries affected,  it is also having significant economic implications.

Going into this outbreak, there were tentative signs that global economic conditions were improving,  following a period of weaker growth over much of 2019. World merchandise trade volumes strengthened  in late 2019 and survey measures of production in manufacturing and services industries improved in some  key economies.

Economic activity in Australia was also strengthening at the end of 2019. The Australian economy grew by  2.2 per cent through the year to the December quarter 2019, a step up from 1.8 per cent through the year  to the September quarter. Growth was expected to pick up over the forecast period, supported by the

personal income tax relief announced in the 2018-19 and 2019-20 Budgets and the Government’s  $100 billion investment in productivity-enhancing infrastructure. Accommodative monetary policy and a  lower Australian dollar were also expected to support a pick-up in growth.

Australia’s position heading into this crisis was stronger than many, with both the IMF and the OECD  forecasting Australia to grow faster than comparable economies, including the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany  and France.

While highly uncertain, it is clear that the spread of the Coronavirus across the world is having a negative  economic impact.

The economic implications of the Coronavirus outbreak to date have been most significant for the Chinese  economy. This reflects the size of the outbreak in China and the measures taken to contain its spread. A  range of economic indicators are showing that the Chinese economy has been severely impacted. A survey  measure of activity in the manufacturing sector had its largest fall in its history in February, while activity in  China’s services sector, particularly transport, real estate and hotel and catering, has weakened  substantially.

The negative economic effect in China is having global implications. Relative to SARS in 2003, China’s  economy is substantially larger and more interconnected with the world, including Australia. Two-thirds of  the world’s economies now have China as one of their top three trading partners. Economies are  experiencing reduced Chinese demand for services overseas such as travel and tourism, and there are  increasing reports of reduced access to goods through supply chains.

The global economic implications have broadened as the Coronavirus has spread to other nations.

The global nature of the shock is evident in financial markets. Stock markets have fallen substantially  around the world in recent weeks, while corporate bond spreads have widened. The Australian dollar is  6 per cent lower on a trade-weighted basis than it was in early January.

Financial regulators around the world are monitoring conditions closely and there is strong communication  amongst our domestic agencies through the Council of Financial Regulators. The Australian financial system  is strong and resilient. Financial markets are continuing to function effectively. Since the global financial  crisis, reforms have been implemented that collectively contribute to a significant increase in the resilience  of our financial system. Specific reforms include: increasing the quantity and quality of banks’ capital and  liquidity positions; strengthening the RBA’s ability to provide financial institutions with emergency funding  during periods of liquidity stress; and strengthening APRA’s crisis management powers.

Oil prices have fallen, to be around 50 per cent lower than prices in early January, reflecting falling global  demand and the collapse of an agreement between major producers to reduce output. While oil-linked  LNG export prices will be negatively affected by these falls, consumers will benefit from lower petrol prices.

In contrast, prices of key bulk commodities have remained resilient to date. This is likely due to an  expectation that the Chinese authorities will move to boost domestic demand through ongoing stimulus  measures, including increased investment in infrastructure.

In response to the Coronavirus outbreak, fiscal authorities in a number of countries have enacted measures  to support both their health systems and their economy more broadly. Governments are providing support,  particularly to sectors and workers most affected by the outbreak, and more announcements are expected.  Monetary policy is responding with more than 35 central banks across the world easing policy in 2020 so  far. This includes the RBA, which reduced the cash rate by 25 basis points in March to a record low of  0.5 per cent.

The fiscal response in a number of key economies, including China, South Korea, Italy and Singapore, has so  far focussed on supporting businesses through this period of uncertainty, for example through  restructuring of loans, tax cuts or retraining. Fiscal responses have also supported households, for example  through cash payments, income support or tax credits.

Like other economies around the world, the Australian economy is already feeling the effects of the global  Coronavirus outbreak. Tourist and student arrivals have been significantly lower than they were in late  2019, and demand for some premium agricultural products has fallen. The reduction in tourism demand

comes on top of the effects on tourism from the summer’s bushfires, which caused some travellers to  cancel or delay their trips to Australia. The effect on the education sector is significant, with over 100,000  Chinese international students not in Australia when the travel ban was actioned.

Based largely on the direct effect of lower international students and tourism expenditure, the Coronavirus  outbreak is expected to detract at least ½ of a percentage point from economic growth in Australia in the  March quarter 2020. This is on top of the estimated detraction from growth from the bushfires of  0.2 percentage points across the December and March quarters.

There remains considerable uncertainty around the potential economic implications of the Coronavirus for  the June quarter and beyond. The economic shock is likely to be significant. There are a wide range of  potential paths for the spread and containment of the virus globally and in Australia. In addition, there is  uncertainty around the impact on confidence, people’s ability to work and business cash flow. The global  spread of the virus and its global economic impact will also flow through to demand for Australia’s exports  and the availability of inputs into domestic production and imported consumption goods.

There are automatic mechanisms that will help to support activity. The flexible exchange rate helps to  mitigate the effect of shocks to global demand, we have a sound and well-capitalised banking sector and  our labour market has shown that it can flexibly respond as firms adjust more through hours than the  number of employees. Automatic fiscal responses, such as reductions in tax revenue and higher payments  to households, will also support activity by households and businesses. With accommodative monetary  policy and this package of support, we are confident that the Australian economy is well placed to get  through this shock.

HOW THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONDING

This $17.6 billion package represents fiscal support across the forward estimates of 0.9 per cent of annual  GDP. This significant action has been taken in the national interest to guard against more severe economic  impacts of the Coronavirus outbreak. The package is front-loaded in order to instil confidence in businesses  and households and help firms keep people employed. This will ensure that the economy is in the best  possible position to recover as the shock subsides.

The 2020-21 Budget, to be delivered in May, will present the latest official forecasts for the economy and  fiscal position. It will reflect the various developments which have taken place since the 2019-20 Mid-Year  Economic and Fiscal Outlook, including the economic and fiscal impacts of the response package.

The IMF and OECD have indicated that Australia is in one of the best positions within advanced economies  to provide fiscal support without endangering debt sustainability. This package has been designed to be  fiscally responsible. The measures will not have a permanent or structural impact on the budget balance.  The Government is protecting the structural integrity of the Budget to keep debt low for future  generations.

The international credit rating agency Standard and Poor’s has indicated that temporary stimulus would be  ‘unlikely to strain Australia’s creditworthiness’ given the Government’s commitment to maintain  medium-term fiscal discipline.

The measures included in this package complement existing programs that are supporting the economy.  These include the already announced packages to support the recovery from the bushfires and drought.

The Government’s response is tailored to the nature of the shock and has been designed around seven key  principles. These are that:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ measures must be proportionate to the degree of the economic shock and the impact on the  economy;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ measures need to be timely and scalable, so they can be adjusted appropriately as the health and  economic effects unfold;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the response needs to be targeted to address the specific issues we are confronting, supporting those  most affected, and delivered where it will be most effective;

4

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the response needs to be aligned with the many other arms of policy and activity, in particular  monetary policy, and with the responses of other governments, particularly at a state and territory  level;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ existing delivery mechanisms should be used, wherever possible;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the measures must be temporary and accompanied by a fiscal exit strategy; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ measures should favour those that will lift productivity to enable the Australian economy to sustain an  even stronger growth trajectory than we were on prior to the crisis.

SUMMARY OF THE ECONOMIC RESPONSE

The Government’s economic response addresses the economic impacts of the Coronavirus outbreak. It is  intended to support confidence, employment and business continuity. It is designed to support business  investment, help small businesses manage short-term cash flow challenges, provide targeted support to  individuals and assistance to the most severely affected communities and regions.

1. Delivering support for business investment

The Government is backing businesses to invest to help the economy withstand and recover from the  economic impact of the Coronavirus. The two business investment measures in this package are designed  to assist Australian businesses and economic growth in the short term, and encourage a stronger economic  recovery following the Coronavirus outbreak.

Increasing the instant asset write-off

From today, the Government is increasing the instant asset write-off threshold from $30,000 to  $150,000 and expanding access to include businesses with aggregated annual turnover of less than  $500 million (up from $50 million) until 30 June 2020. In 2017-18 there were more than 360,000  businesses that benefited from the current instant asset write-off, claiming deductions to the value of  over $4 billion.

Backing business investment

The Government is introducing a time limited 15 month investment incentive (through to  30 June 2021) to support business investment and economic growth over the short term, by  accelerating depreciation deductions. Businesses with a turnover of less than $500 million will be able  to deduct 50 per cent of the cost of an eligible asset on installation, with existing depreciation rules  applying to the balance of the asset’s cost.

These two measures will support over 3.5 million businesses (over 99 per cent of businesses) employing  more than 9.7 million employees.

2.  Cash flow assistance for businesses

This assistance will support businesses to manage cash flow challenges resulting from the economic  impacts of the Coronavirus and help businesses retain their employees. These two measures are designed  to support employing small and medium enterprises and to improve business confidence.

Boosting cash flow for employers

The Boosting Cash Flow for Employers measure will provide up to $25,000 back to small and  medium-sized businesses, with a minimum payment of $2,000 for eligible businesses. The payment  will provide cash flow support to businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million that employ staff.  The payment will be tax free.

This measure will benefit around 690,000 businesses employing around 7.8 million people.

5

Supporting apprentices and trainees

The Government is supporting small business to retain their apprentices and trainees. Eligible  employers can apply for a wage subsidy of 50 per cent of the apprentice’s or trainee’s wage for up to  9 months from 1 January 2020 to 30 September 2020. Where a small business is not able to retain an  apprentice, the subsidy will be available to a new employer that employs that apprentice.

This measure will support up to 70,000 small businesses, employing around 117,000 apprentices.

3. Stimulus payments to households to support growth

This measure will assist around 6.5 million lower income Australians, which will support confidence and  domestic demand in the economy.

Stimulus payments

The Government will provide a one-off $750 payment to social security, veteran and other income  support recipients and eligible concession card holders. Around half of those that will benefit are  pensioners.

There will be one payment per eligible recipient. For example, if a person qualifies for the one-off  payment in multiple ways, they will only receive one payment.

The payment will be tax free and will not count as income for Social Security, Farm Household  Allowance and Veteran payments.

4.  Assistance for severely affected regions

This measure provides $1 billion to support regions most significantly affected by the Coronavirus outbreak.

Support for Coronavirus-affected regions and communities

The Government has set aside $1 billion to support those regions and communities that have been  disproportionately affected by the economic impacts of the Coronavirus, including those heavily  reliant on industries such as tourism, agriculture and education.

This will include the waiver of fees and charges for tourism businesses that operate in the  Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the waiver of entry fees for Commonwealth National Parks. It will  also include additional assistance to help businesses identify alternative export markets or supply  chains. Targeted measures will also be developed to further promote domestic tourism.

The Australian Tax Office (ATO) is also providing administrative relief for some tax obligations for  people affected by the Coronavirus outbreak, on a case-by-case basis. The ATO will set up a temporary  shop front in Cairns within the next few weeks with dedicated staff specialising in assisting small  business. In addition, it will consider ways to enhance its presence in other significantly affected  regions, making it easier for people to apply for relief. The ATO is considering further temporary shop  fronts and face-to-face options.

PACKAGE IMPLEMENTATION

The Government will move quickly to implement this package. To that end, a package of Bills will be  introduced into Parliament in the final Autumn sitting week in March 2020 for Parliament’s urgent  consideration and passage.

Following passage of the Bills through Parliament, the Government will then move to immediately make,  and register, any supporting instruments.
