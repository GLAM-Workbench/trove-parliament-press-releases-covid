STATEMENT ON EARLY LEARNING AND CARE MEASURES

Labor welcomes the measures announced by the Government to further  support families and early learning centres during the COVID-19 crisis.

However, we remain concerned they do not go far enough to ensure the long  term viability of the sector.

Labor will be consulting with providers about the measures and will be  monitoring the situation closely, but we are already aware of number of  concerns from the sector.

In the short term, there remains significant uncertainty about whether early  learning centres will remain open or will be required to close at the same time  schools do.

Whilst the continued payment of the child care subsidy to services directed to  close is an important measure, there is confusion about whether centres who  voluntarily close will continue to receive the payments. There are also  questions around how services will be able to stay open if families choose to  cease enrolment of their children over the coming weeks and months.

Whilst Labor understands the circumstances surrounding COVID-19 are rapidly  evolving, the Government must clearly, swiftly and effectively address the  potential disastrous impact on the early learning sector.

The Government must do everything possible to ensure we do not emerge from  the other side of this crisis facing the permanent closure of early learning  centres.

Labor urges the Morrison Government to listen to the sector and provide the  necessary support to ensure early learning centres remain viable during this



challenging time.
