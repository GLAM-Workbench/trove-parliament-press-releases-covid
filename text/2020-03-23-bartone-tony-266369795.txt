EXPANSION OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES

We thank and acknowledge all of Australia’s vital health care workers for their ongoing  commitment and dedication to providing Australians with the health care they need during  this unprecedented time.

The Government has been consulting extensively with the AMA, RACGP, ACCRM, RDAA,  and other key peak bodies and members of the medical profession and health professions, to  ensure Medicare is responsive to the challenges of COVID-19.

Amendments to Medicare are being implemented quickly, but also in a staged and  proportionate way to ensure critical health services can continue to operate, and the integrity  of our health system is maintained.

The Government is also consulting with the AMA, RACGP, ACCRM, RDAA and other  critical parts of the medical profession during the course of this week to further expand our  telehealth response.

The co-design will look to the best practise expansion of telehealth items for all patients, with  or without COVID-19, to see any general practitioner or medical specialist during the  COVID-19 health emergency.

From today, the Government will enable all vulnerable general practitioners and other  vulnerable health professionals who are currently authorised to use telehealth item numbers,  to use telehealth for all consultations with all their patients.

This includes health care providers who are:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Aged at least 70 years old.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Indigenous and aged at least 50 years old.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Pregnant.

Ã¯ÂÂ· A parent of a child under 12 months.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Immune compromised.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Have a chronic medical condition that results in increased risk from coronavirus  infection.

This change will help protect the most vulnerable members of our health care workforce,  while allowing them to continue to provide much needed medical care and advice to their  patients.

It builds on a series of changes the Government has made in recent weeks, to create a more  responsive and flexible Medicare system that meets the needs of patients and providers during  this crisis.

It is expected a more comprehensive telehealth whole of population model of care and the  detail of telehealth operations via phone and video will be confirmed by the end of this week  as Stage four. This will include mental health and allied health consultations.

It is important that this is done carefully to ensure these new items do not have unintended  adverse consequences for patients or the health system, while allowing general practitioners  and medical specialists to continue to work during the pandemic, using phone and video  where clinically appropriate.

We recognise telehealth is not appropriate for the management of all health care problems and  in many cases face-to-face consultations will still be needed. It is imperative Australians  continue to receive the high quality medical care and advice they expect and deserve from  their health care providers. We cannot risk a reduction in the standard of medical care  provided to the people of Australia.

We emphasise the importance of using telehealth item numbers responsibly, appropriately and  for the right reasons during this pandemic. For details on when telehealth items can be used  please consult www.mbsonline.gov.au

This is new territory for many health care providers, who want to meet the challenges of  providing health care during this medical crisis.

Many important questions and challenges have been raised, and we continue to work through  these. We will continue to communicate changes on the Government website  www.health.gov.au, with regular webinar updates listed online, and through peak bodies.

Stage 2  WC March 16   Ã¢ÂÂ Expansion of MBS Telehealth items for midwives and recognise a  general practice for continuity of care practises (rather than an

individual GP)

Ã¢ÂÂ Indigenous and aged at least 50 years old.

Ã¢ÂÂ Pregnant.
