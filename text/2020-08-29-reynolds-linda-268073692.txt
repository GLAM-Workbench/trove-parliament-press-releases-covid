AUSTRALIA SUPPORTS INDONESIAN COVID-19  RESPONSE

29 August 2020



Australia is providing a package of up to $2 million of medical personal protective  equipment (PPE) including gloves, gowns, masks and thermometers to the Indonesian  military (TNI) as part of the existing Defence Cooperation Program and funding.

Minister for Defence, Senator the Hon Linda Reynolds CSC said Indonesia and  Australia are longstanding partners and friends, sharing a strong bond and a deep  history of cooperation, particularly in times of need.

“COVID-19 brings new challenges and uncertain times to both our countries. Like the  Australian Defence Force in Australia, the TNI is playing a critical role in supporting  Indonesia’s national response to COVID-19,” Minister Reynolds said.

“Just as Indonesia helped us during the bushfire crisis earlier this year, we are pleased  to be able to help our Indonesian friends during these uncertain times.”

The Royal Australian Air Force will support the delivery of the PPE to Halim Air Force  base in Jakarta.

Defence is also working closely with the Indonesian TNI to share knowledge and  lessons learned from our national responses to COVID-19.
