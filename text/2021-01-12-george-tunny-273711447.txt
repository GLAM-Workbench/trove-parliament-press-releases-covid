GEORGIE TUNNY

The Acting Prime Minister now has drawn the attention of human rights groups for comparing last  week’s assault by Trump supporters on the US Capitol building to Black Lives Matter protests. Michael  McCormack has also questioned whether banning Donald Trump from platforms like Twitter is a good  idea and the Acting PM joins us now from Townsville. Mr McCormack, good morning to you.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Good morning to you, too.

GEORGIE TUNNY

Do you stand by those comments that you made, comparing the assault on the Capitol last week with  the Black Lives Matter protests? Just how are they similar?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, any form of violence, any form of protest that ends in death and destruction is abhorred. And you  know, I know this is very difficult for the United States as it goes through great change, but you know  any form of protest, whether it’s a protest over racial riots or, indeed, what we’ve seen on Capitol Hill in  recent days, is condemned and is abhorred.

GEORGIE TUNNY

Well, indeed, you are talking about violence there, but what we do have with the Black Lives Matter  protests from last year, those groups were protesting the death of George Floyd and then what we saw  last week with, though, the storming of the Capitol building, those people were surely just trying to  impede the democratic process. So how are they the same?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, it involves violence, it involves destruction of property, it involves deaths of people. And any  violence of that form is condemned.

GEORGIE TUNNY

But you’ve received criticism from human rights groups, firstly, do you understand where they’re  coming from and what’s your response to it?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, I understand why these protests happened. And let’s face it, in Australia we’ve gone to two world  wars so that people can speak freely, so that they can have that democratic right of free speech. And of  course, we have protests here in Australia. But we don’t want to see the level of violence, the level of  wilful destruction to property that we’ve seen elsewhere and, as I say again, that level of violence, those  sorts of protests that descend into that violence and ultimately the death of people is, of course,  condemned.

GEORGIE TUNNY

Staying with one of the major topics that we’ve been talking about this week, is it your belief that  censorship may be more harmful than the spreading of misinformation?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, I’m not in favour of censorship. I never have been. I’m a former newspaper editor and, of course,  journalists know that they have the right to free speech, as 102,000 names on the War Memorial in  Canberra etched into that bronze who fought so that we could have a democratic country, so that we  could speak freely. And its every free-born person’s right to be able to uphold that freedom of speech.  And I do stick by that.

But, you know, then when you see a company - and let’s face it, it’s up to them to make the decisions  based on their company and what they feel is right - but to take a President’s Twitter feed down whilst  at the same time allowing a soldier, an Aussie digger no less, an image, a fake image, to remain on there  of a soldier, an Australian soldier, potentially and looking like he’s doing harm to a child, I mean really?  That’s not right.

GEORGIE TUNNY

But surely there must be some form of counsel or rebuff for the spreading of misinformation as well  after what we saw on the Capitol last week and what happened? And just overnight your colleague Craig  Kelly, he’s shared information about mandatory masks that is at odds with the health advice. What do  you think is the process moving forward there?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Sure, but who decides who’s going to be taken down? I mean, you’re a journalist, you’re a news  presenter. Is it right that somebody then decides who gets taken down and who gets left up? I mean,  imagine being on that little jury. I wouldn’t want to be on that jury. I don’t think we should have that  sort of censorship in our society. But people also need to think very much about what they put up on  Twitter and what they put up on social media. That’s why we’ve got the eSafety Commissioner, that’s  why our Federal Government, the Liberal Nationals Government, has invested heavily in the eSafety  Commissioner and that’s why we’ve got an eSafety app. And we urge and encourage people to use  social media platforms very wisely and think about what they put up there. Because we are in an era  where mental health is a big thing and people should think very carefully and closely about what they  upload to those social media platforms.

GEORGIE TUNNY

But shouldn’t facts, then, be upheld above all else? What kind of censure is there for party members  who may be spreading misinformation?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, again, I mean, facts sometimes are contentious, aren’t they? And what you may think is right,  somebody else might think is completely untrue. And that’s part of living in a democratic country.

GEORGIE TUNNY

But the scientific facts as well, especially in the times that we live in right now, surely, they must be  given precedence?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, again, I say I’m not in favour of censorship of that order. I’m not in favour of censorship of that  order, but I do urge and encourage Australians and particularly parents when they’re monitoring their  children’s internet activity, just make sure that they download those apps and make sure that they look  at what the eSafety Commissioner, that the Federal Government has invested wisely and heavily, in to  see what they have to offer to make sure that, you know, kids are safe online. I know Nola Marino has  done an enormous job, the Member for Forrest in Western Australia, to urge and encourage people to  use the internet wisely. But as I say, I’m not in favour of censorship, never have been.  GEORGIE TUNNY

Let’s move to JobKeeper. Of course, this program is tapering off, it’s coming to an end. Do you think that  struggling businesses can survive without it firstly and is there a plan for maybe getting some support to  continue if necessary?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

We have provided the support as needed all the way through. We’ve tweaked our responses, we’ve  made sure that we’ve had the right extensions to various programs, certainly in the aviation sector and  looking at JobKeeper and JobSeeker and those sorts of provisions. We’ve met on an almost daily basis as  a Cabinet, as an Expenditure Review Committee but its borrowings can’t keep happening. The debt level  can’t keep rising. We need to taper these off. And business people tell me they don’t want to be on this  sort of assistance. They want to be able to stand on their own two feet. They want business to be  coming through their doors and they want the turnover to be happening such that they get back to  where they were, some sort of normal cases in, you know, pre-COVID business activity.

And I know this is so important. And I know that Peter Strong from COSBOA and others, ACCI and  various business groups, they also want to see business back to where it was at some level pre-COVID.  It’s going to be difficult, there’s no question. 2021 is also going to present many challenges. I’ve owned a  small business. I’ve operated one. I know how hard it is.

GEORGIE TUNNY

Excuse me for interrupting you there Acting PM, but I did just want to talk about businesses and how  they can continue. Because of course it’s related to borders and whether or not they do stay open. How  do you view the current state of border closures right around the country?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, again, it’s difficult. But we’ve got the vaccine to be rolled out in February. I spoke to Minister Greg  Hunt yesterday, the Health Minister, about that very provision of getting that assistance, getting those  vaccines out the door. And we’ll make sure - Josh Frydenberg, and I spoke to him at length last night,  the Treasurer, about what we’re doing as far as supporting businesses. And we’ll continue to make sure  that we provide the right assistance for workers, for businesses. But again, I say, you know, the support  that we provided through JobKeeper was always temporary and was always targeted. Businesses knew  that. We need these border closures to be lifted and life to get back to some sort of normality, because  we need business activity.

I’m in Townsville, a great place to visit, a great place for tourist activities. And businesses here, they’re  crying out for people to come here, to spend money and to see the great delights that are in the tropical  north.

GEORGIE TUNNY

As a Queenslander myself, I do know how beautiful that part of the world is. And just finally, Mr  McCormack, yesterday the WA Premier called on New South Wales to reassess its virus approach and to  pursue elimination instead. What do you think?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

I think what New South Wales has done as far as tracking and tracing has been magnificent. They’ve  shared the heavy bulk of the load of bringing Australians home - 443,000 Australians have returned  home since the Prime Minister made that call and urged and encouraged Australians to return on March

13. 71,000 since September 18. New South Wales has borne the brunt of that and many of those West  Australians have come through Sydney, done the quarantining and then returned back to Perth or  wherever else in Western Australia. So I don’t think Mark McGowan - as good a job as he’s done, too - I  don’t think he should be criticising Gladys Berejiklian. I think, instead, he should be picking the phone up  and saying, “Thank you for doing what you’ve done,” and New South Wales has been very, very good at  keeping its economy open and helping not just its own state but all Australia.

GEORGIE TUNNY

Acting Prime Minister, Michael McCormack, from Townsville. Thank you very much for joining us this  morning. We appreciate your time.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Come visit here. Thank you very much.
