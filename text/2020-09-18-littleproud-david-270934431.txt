Show and shine: support ensures bright future

Ã¯ÂÂ· Applications open today for the Supporting Agricultural Shows and Field Days  program.  Ã¯ÂÂ· COVID-19 is having an unprecedented impact on agricultural shows and field days,  with most cancelled for 2020.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Agricultural shows and field days contribute more than $1 billion to the economy each

year but rely largely on financial assistance from supporters and attendees.

Applications are now open for the Australian Government’s $39 million Supporting Agricultural  Shows and Field Days program.

Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said agricultural show societies and field day organisers will  have until 9 October 2020 to apply for a one-off payment under the first funding round.

“This is a pandemic-busting cash injection for all those shows and field day events forced to cancel  this year because of COVID-19,” Minister Littleproud said.

“We know that both agricultural shows and field days are significant social and economic  contributors to hundreds of Australian bush and regional communities.

“They contribute more than $1 billion to the national economy each year, attract more than six  million patrons and are supported by more than 50,000 volunteers.

“That is why this Government is investing $39 million to help them deal with cash flow pressures  caused by COVID-19 cancellations and ensure their future.

“Agricultural shows and field days also play an important role in supporting on-farm innovation,  productivity and profitability.

“They bring our families and farmers together, build community spirit and help bridge the divide  between country and city.

“We want to assure the dedicated volunteers and communities who work so hard to stage these  events that we are with them all the way during these times. Agriculture will lead the recovery out  of this pandemic, and this support will help ensure the sustainability of these important events into  the future.

“Agricultural shows and field days that have cancelled their event in 2020 because of COVID-19  will be eligible to apply and they will not have to compete for assistance.

“I encourage show societies and field day organisers to jump on the Government’s Community  Grants Hub or GrantConnect sites now to check their eligibility and apply.

“I will continue to encourage my state and territory counterparts to also make a contribution to help  agricultural shows and field days survive the impact of COVID-19 because of the positive impact  they have on their economies. The Australian Government has stepped in to help out agricultural  shows and field days during this tough period, and I hope the states and territories can do  likewise.”

Chair of Agricultural Shows Australia Dr Rob Wilson welcomed the opening of applications and  urged agricultural show societies forced to cancel their 2020 show to apply.

“Agricultural shows have been impacted by COVID-19 and this financial support will assist  planning to begin for shows in 2021 and will provide the local communities the confidence to  engage and participate, to ensure these Australian iconic events to continue,” Dr Wilson said.

“We know agricultural shows are important to regional and metropolitan Australia as they provide  community connections and wellbeing as well as encouraging agricultural education through  competition and benchmarking of agricultural pursuits and produce.

“This program supports both the Capital City Royal Shows and right down to the smallest country  show.”

Secretary of the Association of Agricultural Field Days of Australasia Ms Wendy Franklin also  welcomed the opening of applications.

“Regrettably, COVID-19 has caused almost all agricultural field days in Australia to be cancelled in  2020. This has created financial difficulty for organisers of these important events,” Ms Franklin  said.

“I welcome this program because it will provide the funding that many agricultural field day  organisers will need to keep their events running in a post-COVID-19 environment.

“This is good news not just for field days but the important agricultural industries they support.”
