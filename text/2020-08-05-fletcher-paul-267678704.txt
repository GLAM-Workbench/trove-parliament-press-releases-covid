More funds flow for public interest journalism

The Morrison Government today announced that 41 publishers will receive a share of $5 million in  the 2020 round of the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund.

Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher MP, said the funding  will help small metropolitan and regional publishers adapt to unprecedented challenges in the current  media environment.

“While the media industry has been going through a significant and sustained transition period,  COVID-19 has put the delivery of quality journalism under further pressure,” Minister Fletcher said.

“The grants will help successful recipients continue to generate public interest journalism through  investment digital initiatives, technical upgrades and staff training, as well as supporting salaries.”

“Two-thirds of the funding will go to regional publishers and the balance will go to small  metropolitan publishers.”

The Innovation Fund, which began in 2018, is administered by the Australian Communications and  Media Authority (ACMA). It is part of the Government's Regional and Small Publishers Jobs and  Innovation Package, designed to boost sustainability and the ongoing production of news in the  modern media environment.

Successful recipients include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ GJ Adams Trust, publisher of The Shepparton Adviser in Victoria, which will receive up to  $238,086 to increase the reach and production of public interest journalism both in print and  online by developing a website and engaging new staff.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Trustee for Parkes-Brown Family Trust, publisher of the Glasshouse Country & Maleny

News in Queensland, which will receive up to $108,200 to develop a new website portal, digital  content publishing and revenue generation platform.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Newstate Media Newcastle Pty Ltd, publisher of the Newcastle Weekly in New South Wales,  which will receive up to $132,711 to expand its news coverage, employ new staff and conduct

sales training for print and digital media.

“In recognition of the significant challenges posed by COVID-19, this round was expedited to help  small and regional publishers keep delivering news and information to local communities at this  critical time,” Minister Fletcher said.

The ACMA worked closely with an independent advisory committee to assess applications through a
