WAGGA WAGGA PRESS CONFERENCE  29 January 2020

Subjects: Regional Australia’s coronavirus vaccine roll-out;

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, good morning and I am really pleased that Wagga Wagga Base Hospital is going to be one of 11  centres - 11 hospitals - throughout New South Wales to roll out the first vaccine, the Pfizer vaccine,  which of course, as we know, has to be stored below minus 70 degrees Celsius, for doctors within  the health system. I've just spoken to the Chief Executive of the Murrumbidgee Local Health District,  Jill Ludford and they are ready and very, very able to be able to roll-out the vaccine when it becomes  first available. I'm delighted that Wagga Wagga has been chosen as one of the first sites in New  South Wales, indeed in the country, to be rolling out the vaccine.

This follows on, of course, from the Federal Government sponsoring and supporting the first  respiratory clinics and Wagga Wagga was the first regional respiratory clinic back in April for New  South Wales. So Wagga Wagga is at the forefront of our battle against COVID-19. And we are getting  through COVID-19. Of course, it's been very, very difficult and I say again to Australians, thank you so  much for what you've done so far. It's still important to exercise social distancing. It's still important  to wear masks when you're supposed to do so. It's still important that we follow the best possible  medical advice, right down from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, from  Professor Paul Kelly, the Acting Chief Medical Officer, from Brendan Murphy, of course who's filled  that role so admirably over so many months through the COVID-crisis. And of course our Chief  Medical Officers in the states. This hasn't been easy. But regional Australia has led the way and  that's why largely we are living life as we otherwise normally would. Yes, there are some restrictions.  Of course, there are some places where you are required to wear a mask and we thank Australians,  particularly regional Australians, for doing just that - it has been difficult. Regional Australia is  leading the COVID-recovery through agriculture, through resources and through what we've done as  communities to keep our areas, our towns, our cities such as Wagga Wagga and others besides,





largely COVID-free. As well as Wagga Wagga with the COVID vaccine, the Pfizer vaccine, also Dubbo  will be another one of those 11 sites - 11 hospitals - and that's important for my electorate, for the  Riverina and Central West because, of course, many people from Parkes and Forbes in the northern  part of the local area that I so proudly serve, they go to Dubbo for their medical services and of  course, they'll be utilising that.

But this is for doctors - this is for doctors within the system. This is also for the aged care residents  within the Murrumbidgee Health Local District system and also for those workers in those aged care  centres. So the fuller roll-out of the COVID vaccine of course will follow. There'll be the AstraZeneca  that will be through GP clinics. Those have not been yet announced of course, but it will be largely,  broadly GP clinics right throughout the Riverina and Central West, indeed right throughout regional  Australia and the rest of the nation.

But this is an important breakthrough and an important step forward with Wagga Wagga Base  Hospital chosen as one of the first 11 medical sites to be rolling out Pfizer for those specialist  medical people, for those doctors, for those health care workers within the Murrumbidgee Local  Health District system. So certainly Wagga Wagga is at the forefront of the COVID-recovery.

JOURNALIST

Why Wagga Wagga and why Dubbo?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well they're large regional centres and we want to make sure that we get the vaccine out as soon as  we can and of course, the vaccine will be available. Minister Greg Hunt has said all the way along  we're looking at a late February roll-out so we're working very steadily towards that. We haven't got  all our eggs in one basket. We've made sure that we've got AstraZeneca, we've made sure that  we've rolled this out in a very practical and safe way. This is keeping our medical professionals safe  and through them the community safe. This is about making sure that our regional communities are  as safe and as COVID-free as they can be.

JOURNALIST

Why exactly Dubbo over somewhere like Orange or Bathurst as well?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, I haven't got the full list right in front of me, but Dubbo and Wagga Wagga Hospitals are of  course the hubs of huge regional centres and of course as the vaccine rolls out, of course there will  be other centres such as Orange and other centres looked at. But for the immediate roll-out, 11 sites  were chosen by New South Wales Health, I have to put them in the frame because New South Wales  Health has been magnificent the whole way through. I've spoken with the Minister any number of  times and he's been very, very good, both at the macro level but also on the micro level, helping  patients and people with quarantining and any local issues. He's always been only too happy to take





my calls and only too happy to act on those calls. I'm very, very thankful for what's been done on the  state front. New South Wales has been the standard bearer as far as making sure that we've kept all  Australian communities safe through COVID-19. And I applaud what New South Wales Health has  done, but of course this vaccine is going to be free of charge to Australian residents, of course, via  the Federal Government. Not only are we going to make it free of charge for Australian residents but  indeed our South Pacific Island friends too, because that's what good neighbours do.

JOURNALIST

So the roll-out will go deep into regional Australia to ensure people don't have to do a six-hour  round trip?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

We're endeavouring to make it available to as many sites so that people do not have to travel hours  and hours and hours to get a jab. We want as many Australians, in fact all Australians, to take  advantage of that because the more people who get vaccinated, the more people who take the  vaccine, the less chance we have of outbreaks and that's critical. We want Australia to be safe. It's  much better to get that jab, to get those doses and it could be one or two to get the full suite of  safety from COVID-19. Better to get that jab than weeks later be in ICU and regretting that you  didn't. So it's pretty simple.

JOURNALIST

Can you confirm at this stage that we will be able to get the Pfizer vaccines to Wagga by the end of  February?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Look, that's the timeline that we're working at for the medical professionals within the  Murrumbidgee Health Local District. That's what I've just spoken to Jill Ludford about. That's the  time frame that we're working towards. But if it's not late February, then early March, but rest  assured Wagga Wagga has been chosen. The Base Hospital has been chosen to be one of the leading  sites and one of the first sites throughout New South Wales for the roll-out of the vaccine.

JOURNALIST

And are all health care workers and MLHD eligible for that first roll-out or are there specific  professionals that -

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Within the Murrumbidgee Local Health District that's what I've been advised.







JOURNALIST

Do you have any figures on how many vaccines will be delivered initially?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, it will be enough to ensure that all those workers, all those specialists, all those doctors within  the system can receive the jab, can receive the vaccine, as well as those aged care residents within  the system and indeed the workers who care for them too.

So, this is a relatively large roll-out. We're making sure that we're forward leaning, we're working  through New South Wales Health. Minister Greg Hunt has been working with each and every State  and Territory authority to make sure that we have this roll-out as smooth and practical as possible.  Yes, there will be hiccups along the way. It's a big roll-out. There's 25 million Australians and of  course, once we have the doctors and the health care workers done, of course then there's a system  by which first responders, aged care workers of course, aged care residents, we're making sure that  meat workers will be amongst the first to receive the jab. And of course then it will become available  to others through their local GP clinic. We want as many Australians by mid-year to have had the  vaccine once it's available, to get that vaccine to keep their communities, to keep their families, to  keep themselves COVID-free and COVID-safe.

JOURNALIST

When will [indistinct] the Harden Medical Centre?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, I've been speaking with the Aged Care Minister Richard Colbeck on a daily basis. I've been  speaking to people such as Christopher Manchester who I know was one of those responsible for  having the Harden facility set up when it moved from Galong about 13 years ago. This is a very good  facility. It's only 13 years old, it’s right next door to the ambulance station, it’s right next door to the  multipurpose health centre there. I know I've been working also with Steph Cooke, the Member for  Cootamundra. Both her and I of course want the very best for the residents, as does the community.  If you have a nan or pop or indeed, mum or dad, in that aged care facility at Harden you don't want  to have to drive to Young or Harden. Some people don't have the capacity to do just that, so when  you've got a 45-bed aged care facility right in your hometown and your loved family member is in  that facility, well you want that facility to stay open.

I've also spoken about a number of prospective buyers. Look, I appreciate that St Lawrence are  looking at consolidating, they're looking at both their nearby facilities. But that's cold comfort I guess  for the residents who've come to call that facility home, who've perhaps lived at Harden most if not  all of their lives. So I'll be working very closely with the current owners to make sure that the  transition is as smooth as possible. But we'll be doing what we can to keep that facility open.  Whether it's once all the residents have been moved out to other nearby facilities or whether it's  before that, but we want the absolute best possible options available for Harden residents. Yes, it's a





little community but little communities they have to be able to have aged care as well because it's  also an ageing community and we want the very best, that's why I've been working around the clock  with the right people to get the right outcomes.

JOURNALIST

Would you say to people who might have some concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the  vaccines that Australia is [inaudible].

MICHAEL McCORMACK

It's not hard to get a needle in your arm. Better to get a jab in your arm than in a few weeks' time be  lying in ICU, can't catch your breath and be wondering why you didn't do it. I mean it makes pretty  easy sense to get that vaccine shot, to get that COVID shot and to have that peace of mind, not only  for yourself but for those around you, for those you love and for those you may not even know. It's  pretty easy. It's pretty simple. Get the shot, do the right thing. Not just for yourself but for others as  well.

Thank you very much.
