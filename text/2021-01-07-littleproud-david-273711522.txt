WESTERN AUSTRALIA’S DISASTER RESILIENCE BOOSTED  BY $1.3 MILLION IN GRANTS

More than $1.3 million in grants have been awarded to nine projects aiming to enhance resilience  within Western Australian communities.

The grants are being provided under the joint Commonwealth-State National Disaster Resilience  Program (NDRP).

Minister for Emergency Management David Littleproud said all sectors of the community had a role  to play in preparing for disasters.

“Australians are strongest when we come together, and we look forward to seeing the positive  results once these projects are implemented.”

Western Australian Minister for Emergency Services Francis Logan said these projects would help  communities prepare to survive, adapt and hopefully thrive when faced with natural disasters.

“The Black Summer bushfires and COVID-19 have shown how important it is for us to work  together to keep our communities safe,” Minister Logan said.

“The NDRP grants will help support the delivery of projects that address risks and reduce capability  gaps within WA, while continuing to build our resilience to face future disasters.

“Congratulations to the nine awarded projects, I know they will help to build strong and adaptable  communities ready to face potential disasters.”
