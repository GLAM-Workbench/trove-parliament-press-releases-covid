MEDIA RELEASE  ROBODEBT

Senate committee tables second robodebt interim report citing ongoing

issues that still need to be addressed

The Senate Community Affairs References committee have tabled their second

interim report into Centrelink's Income Compliance Program known as

robodebt.

The Committee has tabled this second interim export as it is not in a position to

finalise the inquiry because of problems with access to information due to

claims of public interest immunity by the Government and the COVID-19

pandemic limiting the Committee’s ability to hold hearings or seek further

evidence.

The committee has made 5 recommendations including that an independent

review is immediately initiated into the policy, design, administration and impact

of Centrelink’s compliance program.

The committee recommends that:

1. Services Australia immediately terminate the Income Compliance Program

2. Services Australia ensure its communication strategy relating to the

repayment of unlawfully-raised compliance debts takes into consideration the

additional needs of and provides appropriate supports to:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ vulnerable populations, such as people with disability or who are

experiencing homelessness;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢    people with low literacy and numeracy; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢    people for whom English is not a first language

3.    Services Australia immediately allocate additional staff to focus on

contacting customers who have not engaged with the refund process in order to

ensure the repayment of all unlawfully-raised compliance debts to all affected

individuals is completed in a timely manner.

4.    Services Australia immediately review its evidentiary responsibilities for

raising overpayment debts in all of its compliance programs, with particular

reference to:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢    the responsibilities of the agency under sections 1222A and 1223 of the

Social Security Act 1991 for proving an overpayment debt is due to the

Commonwealth; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢    whether section 66A of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999

provides an appropriate legal basis for requiring individuals to update income

information where there has been no change in circumstances.

5.    An independent review is immediately initiated into the policy, design and

administration and impact of  Centrelink's compliance program, including the

Income Compliance Program.
