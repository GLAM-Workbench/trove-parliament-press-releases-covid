Subjects: COVID; Huonville stormwater project; China; Tasmanian infrastructure; JobKeeper; Joe the  Pigeon.

BEC ENDERS

Welcome, everybody. Thanks for the media being here today. And this morning we’re meeting on the  land of the Melukerdee people, which is lovely, our local Aboriginal community. It gives me great  pleasure to welcome the Deputy Prime Minister, the Honourable Michael McCormack, and also the  Senator of Tasmania, the Honourable Jonathon Duniam. Jonno spends a lot of time here in the Huon  Valley, and we really appreciate his support and his regularity in the Huon Valley. We also have the  Honourable Mark Shelton, who is the Minister of Local Government, and also Nic Street, our local MP,  Liberal MP. Thank you for being here as well, Nic.

So today we’re here to celebrate, really, the official completion of the Huonville Stormwater Diversion  project. And the actual stormwater, length of the stormwater pipeline is 1-kilometre long. It diverts the  flow of water from our main draining system into a water catchment. There’s been a lot of people  involved in this project, which I would like to take the opportunity just to acknowledge. But, importantly,  this stormwater project, which has been generously - we’ve received funds from the Australian  Government - thank you - of $1.6 million towards this project. And then the Tasmanian Government  have provided us with interest-free loans to be able to complete the project. And they need to be  acknowledged as well for their contribution.

The stormwater allows obviously us to increase our capacity of drainage here in Huonville. Huonville is a  growing place so it’s really important that this project was completed. It also will give us future  protection for our people that live here but also for those businesses that operate from here in  Huonville. The capacity of the stormwater system also allows us to respond to those frequent rain  events that we will increasingly get over time. So that’s really important.

It has also enabled us to open up some really prime, general residential land which we wouldn’t have  been able to do without this project. Huonville is growing and there is a demand, and we need to meet  that demand, so this project helps fulfil that.

And so as far as thank yous go, I’d like to thank any staff member or contractor that’s literally had their  hand involved in this job. We’ve got a great result here, not only functionality-wise but as aesthetically  as well, which is really important. I’d like to say a special thank you to Malcolm Russell, who is our  project officer for this particular project who saw it through from start to end. And also to give special  acknowledgement as well for the contribution from project officers and staff, Len Bester, Sue McCarter  and also Jade Jones. They all really put a lot of work into this project and into the design work.

So thank you very much. Without further ado I’ll hand over to the Deputy Prime Minister.



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, actually, why don’t we hear from Mark, first.



MARK SHELTON

Well, ladies and gentlemen, again, it’s lovely to be down here in the Huon to have a look at what’s been  going on. A fantastic process and I’m privileged to be here acting on behalf of the Government, of  course, which assisted the local council, Huonville Council, on the work that they’ve done. Now I also  have to thank the Acting Prime Minister for coming down. Michael, welcome to Tasmania, and hopefully  you enjoy your short stay. But, acknowledging, of course, Nic Street, the local member, and Senator  Jonno Duniam with us today, as well as the mayor, Mayor Enders, and of course, as a previous mayor of  Meander Valley Council, acknowledging all the council staff and the work and effort that they have to  put in to a project like this. It’s been a project that’s taken a number of months to complete and was  completed through last year and has been - had some water flowing down through it as I understand  and it’s been tried out.

So this is a fantastic project because it embraces, of course, the three levels of government - state, local  and Federal Government - in coming together to overcome a problem that local councils have had for a  number of years and opening up, of course, some land that hasn’t been available in the past as Mayor  Enders said. And that, as I understand it, will allow a 71-lot subdivision. And I saw some sold lots on  some of the lots as we come past there today. So for the council it’s a fantastic opportunity to make  sure that, you know, a growing community has the opportunity to develop. It’s not only that, because  good planning as well has been able to infill an area that hasn’t been able to be filled before and, of  course, prevents that storm inundation that’s about. So from an economic point of view and a social  point of view, fantastic to see the three levels of government coming together to overcome a problem  that’s been around now for a number of years. And look, that’s what we have to do as far as  governments go - working together to overcome our problems.

So it’s my pleasure now, I believe, to go to Senator Duniam to add a few more words. So thank you all  for being here.



JONATHON DUNIAM

Well, it is great to be here in the glorious Huon Valley with our Acting Prime Minister, who makes a habit  of every time he’s got this job coming to Tasmania, which is most pleasing for us in this State. There is  no bigger backer of regional communities than the Morrison-McCormack Government, and this project  is another example of how we are fostering growth in communities and supporting these communities  to realise their potential. So it is pleasing to have you, Acting PM, thank you for joining us.

And while I do have the opportunity to speak, I do want to acknowledge the Acting PM’s commitment to  our state. Only recently as a strong advocate for small businesses and for regional communities in  particular, the Acting PM championed our call to have the Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation  Scheme extended. And so the result of his work, his lobbying and a commitment he’s made to our State,  we have free car travel for tourists coming to our state and cars travelling on the Spirit of Tasmania. This  is a wonderful thing. It will help our tourism industry, many of them here in the Huon Valley when we  have people that come on the Spirit, hop in their car and head south. They’ll be spending their time and  their money in places like this. So it’s a wonderful announcement and I just wanted to take this  opportunity to thank you, Acting PM, for that wonderful commitment to our state and thank you again  for being with us. So over to you.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Thank you, Senator Jonno Duniam, a champion for regional Tasmania. A champion for jobs. And as  Mayor Bec Enders has said, this is about job creation. It’s also about providing a stormwater solution.  And certainly when it rains - and it rains very heavily here - we know that those sorts of pieces of  infrastructure come in so handy. They are essential for flood mitigation and for getting the water out as  quickly as possible.

And as the Local Government Minister, Mark Shelton, has just said, this will and has provided for a 71-block subdivision, residential subdivision to be developed. I hear there’s interest in actually have a  supermarket come here, too. This is going to be so beneficial in the future. I had the pleasure of having a  meeting with Mayor Bec Enders just prior to this launch, although, as I’m told, the rain event has already  officially opened the stormwater drain. But she tells me about the progress. She tells me about the  interest in the Huon Valley, in Huonville, as a place to come to make your future life all that more  rewarding. Because we want to increase the liveability of these regional centres. And with COVID, with  droughts, with bushfires, with everything else that has beset our regional communities in recent years,  we know that these places are the places to live for the future. And by investing $1.6 million in federal  money and around about $4 million all up in a project such as this - we did it through the Regional Jobs  and Investment Program - we know that we are improving and increasing the liveability of regional  centres such as Huonville. And as the local member, Nic Street, will also tell you, that is so important  because it does create jobs - around 40 or so, Malcolm Russell, the project manager, told me, around  40-50 jobs in the construction. But for the people who live around here and the people who will live

here in the future, this will provide flood mitigation. And that is, as we all know, anybody who lives in a  regional centre near a water course knows, that can be so, so important when you have a big rain event.

But Jonno Duniam is a champion for, as I say, not just regional Tasmania but for the entire state. And he  and I confer often about what is needed. We had the pleasure of having breakfast with Premier Peter  Gutwein this morning and I’m catching up with Michael Ferguson a little later on today up north. We  know just how important Tasmania is going to be in the recovery from COVID-19. COVID-19 has had  such an effect on our economy, but with the measures that we’ve put in place, certainly for health  outcomes but also for the economic recovery, the regional areas of Tasmania, the regional areas of  Australia are leading the way in that recovery.

Scott Morrison knows that, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg knows that. And that’s why we are investing so  heavily in - as a Nationals and Liberals Government, that’s why we are investing so heavily in regional  areas. And the Peter Gutwein Liberal Government here in Tasmania is doing the same. And we work  very well in concert with one another. But certainly with local government. And Mark Shelton has got  one of the most important portfolios in the Gutwein Government, and that is in local government.  Because it all starts with local government. That’s why it’s great to partner with Bec Enders, with  certainly the Huon Valley local government area, beneficiary of $1.56 million as part of the Local Roads  and Community Infrastructure Program where the 537 councils right across the nation are going to  benefit from that money that they can put towards a roundabout, putting a lick of paint on a town hall,  whatever the case might be. It’s going to provide for jobs. It’s going to provide for local procurement  and it’s going to provide for projects such as this, which is going to make such a difference for these  communities going forward.



JOURNALIST

We’re obviously good at small target projects here in Tasmania, but do you concede that Tasmania is  very obviously failing at major infrastructure projects when it comes to the Bridgewater bridge, Hobart  light rail, Macquarie Point and now probably the new Spirit of Tasmania? Do you concede that we’re  failing on that?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

There is a new air of optimism about building big infrastructure and making sure that Tasmania has a  part of that. $110 billion of infrastructure right around the nation and Tasmania is very much part and  parcel of that. That is why Michael Ferguson and I talk just about every three days about what we can do  to build those big infrastructure projects. Seventeen of the last 21 dams nationally have been built in  Tasmania. And so that’s a big tick. And whether you look at road projects across the state, they’re  happening. They’re happening right now. I’ve come down here many, many times in this portfolio since  I’ve become the Deputy Prime Minister back in 2018 and worked with the State Government, worked  with Jonno Duniam to increase and improve infrastructure in this state. And we work very closely - very  closely, hand in hand - with the Gutwein Government. I know Scott Morrison and Peter converse very

often about the infrastructure that Tasmanians need, want, expect and deserve. And we’ll continue to  do that.

JOURNALIST

We’ve done plenty of press conferences for new roads and new irrigation projects -



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Precisely, that’s my point exactly.



JOURNALIST

But you have to concede, we’re dragging our heels on the big ticket items, though.



MICHAEL McCORMACK

We’re getting things done. We’re getting things done. It’s $110 billion of infrastructure. Rome wasn’t  built overnight, nor were the Pyramids. And so we are very much - we have got a plan going forward.  It’s a 10-year rolling infrastructure plan. $110 billion, a record amount of money. And I know the  Tasmanian Government is partnering with us. As I say, Michael Ferguson and I, Senator Jonno Duniam  and I, we converse - or Jonno and I do just about every day and Michael Ferguson and I talk just about  every other day about the infrastructure that Tasmania needs. And we’re getting it done.



JOURNALIST

Will the National Party field candidates at the next federal election?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Most likely.



JOURNALIST

In Tasmania?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Most likely. We’ll certainly field candidates right across the nation because we know and understand  that when you’ve got a Coalition Government like we have in Canberra, a Liberal Government like we  have in Hobart and in Tasmania, that’s when you get infrastructure built. That’s when you get  partnerships. That’s when you get collaboration and cooperation on projects such as this. And that’s  what is best for this country as we recover from COVID-19.



JOURNALIST

Just returning to the Spirits, how likely do you think it is that they will be built in Australia?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, look - the what, sorry?



JOURNALIST

The Spirit of Tasmania.



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Look, you know, we’re doing things, as I say, in collaboration. We’re hoping that we do have a local  manufacturing outcome. I know Karen Andrews as the minister responsible for that is working  extremely hard all the time to get manufacturing happening. But, again, we will weigh up those things as  we go forward. You know, these are outcomes that our government will always assess and look at. So,  yeah.



JOURNALIST

Just on hotel quarantining nationally, are we seeing Queensland coming out and saying they’d like to  potentially send people to outback or mining towns and use those facilities. Is that something that all  states should be doing - looking at other options apart from hotel quarantine in the capitals?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, I know Jane Halton has been entrusted with the task of looking with the States to look at  quarantining options. We are, of course, understanding fully that the States have the jurisdictional  responsibility for quarantine. We’re working very closely with them. We’ve got 1,500 Australian Defence  Force personnel helping the states with all manner of relief and recovery efforts out of COVID-19.  Quarantining very much part and parcel of state governments’ public health responsibilities. But we’ll  work through the National Cabinet process. We’ll keep taking the best possible advice from the  Australian Health Protection Principal Committee and we’ll operate on that advice.



JOURNALIST

Do you think that regional communities could actually cope with quarantining international arrivals  with, you know, medical and security staff, and do you reckon -



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, again, it is the State Governments’ responsibility and obviously the State Government will look at  risk assessments, look at their capability and provisions to be able to keep that stringent public health  outcome as number one. The first order of priority with COVID-19 is making sure we’ve got the right  health outcomes. And the second order of priority and, of course, tied in with that, dovetailing in with  that, is the economic recovery. Now we’ve done very well on both fronts. We’ve done very, very well.  It’s very sad that 909 people have lost their lives. Very, very sad. But when you compare our health  outcomes with any nation elsewhere in the world we’ve done very well. And we’re getting through  making sure that we’ve got the vaccine. Astra Zeneca will save lives. We’ve got 140 million doses. We’ve  put not all our eggs in one basket. We’ve looked at Pfizer as well. And we will make sure that next  month when the vaccine starts to roll out that all Australians will have access to it. We’ll also help out  with our Pacific Island friends, because that’s what a good neighbour does. We’ll make sure we get  Australians through this. We’re very pleased that we’ve got good support overnight from scientists,  from health experts, about our strategy with the vaccines.



JOURNALIST

The World Health team has now arrived in Wuhan to investigate the origins of the pandemic. How  confident are you that they’ll be able to carry out their work unhindered?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, that is a matter for the World Health Organisation and the Chinese government. And I’m sure that  the World Health Organisation, being the august organisation it is, will make sure that its enquiries in  this regard are what they need to be.



JOURNALIST

What do you hope the investigation will reveal?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

That’s a matter for the World Health Organisation. You know, I’m sure that, as I say, they will take their  work as seriously as they always do. They’ll take their work and undertake it in the most professional  manner, as they always do and they’ll get the right outcome.



JOURNALIST

Should China be penalised if they weren’t transparent about those early case numbers?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, again, the World Health Organisation will look into this, will find the right reasons and undertake  their studies, as they also do, very, very diligently and I’m sure they’ll come up with the answers they  need.



JOURNALIST

Do you think it’s actually, you know, possible to conduct an investigation in a country such as China that  doesn’t actually value democracy and freedom?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

I’m not going to get into a debate about what China should or shouldn’t be doing. I’m concerned - our  focus has always been on Australians’ health, Australians’ health outcomes and rebuilding our economy.  That’s why projects such as this - albeit a stormwater drain, you know, little by little - projects such as  this and larger projects such as the Bridgewater bridge and other major water infrastructure projects etc

right across Tasmania are helping build our economy, rebuild our economy, from, you know, any  number of things, not least of which, of course, is COVID-19. So that’s my focus, Scott Morrison’s focus.  He’s taking a well-earned break. He’ll probably be looking forward to getting back to work on Monday.  And I’m sure that through he and Josh Frydenberg and Peter Gutwein and others, Jonno Duniam and  myself, you know, we’re getting on to rebuild Tasmania, to rebuild Australia as we should.



JOURNALIST

Just in terms of if the Queensland government was to pursue a regional model, would the Federal  Government help out with ADF personnel and other things to make it happen?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, we’ll weigh up that request if it comes. But Annastacia Palaszczuk has already got on-farm  quarantining arrangements. She’s discussed that, she’s talked about that. I know they’ve got a model in  place for Gladstone for the resource sector et cetera. We’ll look at that and any request that comes in,  as we have done all the way through. As I said, there’s 1,500 Australian Defence Force personnel  working closely with state governments as we speak to ensure that we get the right outcomes.

Of course, States are limited by their policing and their ability to make sure that quarantining is what it  needs to be. And that’s why when there was this virulent strain, the UK strain of the virus, that the  quarantining was reduced by half. But I say again, New South Wales has led the way as far as  quarantining is concerned, and they should be commended for the work that they have done. We are  bringing as many Australians home as possible, and that’s important, and that’s why we’ll continue to  work with the States through the National Cabinet, through the AHPPC. It’s worked well so far. We’ve  taken the best possible medical advice and we’ll continue to do so.



JOURNALIST

Returning to the Wuhan investigation, are you concerned that that investigation is going to hamper the  mending of the relationship with China specifically when it comes to trade tensions at the moment?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Our phone lines are always open. Our doors are always open as far as diplomatic relations with China  and trade are concerned. I know how important it is for the producers here in Tasmania to ensure that  we continue our trade with China, which is worth $149.6 billion. It’s our largest trading partner.  Tasmania produces a lot goods that go to China. We want that to continue.



JOURNALIST

What’s your take on China rejecting Australian cherries on the grounds that the Chilean ones are better?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

They’re not better; they’re certainly not better. I’ve tasted both Batlow and Young cherries. Now, I’m a  little bit biased because one of those areas is very close to my electorate and the other one is smack  bang in the middle of my Riverina electorate and they were the biggest, plumpest, ripest, most tasty  cherries I’ve ever had. And they went down very well on the Christmas dinner table, let me tell you. But  I’m sure wherever else they produce cherries in Australia, they are the best. And you want to get stuck  into them; they’re great. Red, juicy, plump. Beautiful.



JOURNALIST

The best cherries come out of the Huon Valley.



MICHAEL McCORMACK

So there you go. And whenever we produce cherries, they’re great, fantastic.



JOURNALIST

Just returning to the vaccine, big business has called for National Cabinet to clarify employer and  employee rights over vaccinations fearing legal action if the federal government doesn’t lead the way.  What is the Federal Government guidance? Can employers compel workers to get vaccinations?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, that’s why we’ve got the National Cabinet process in place. It has worked very, very well. I know  they’ve met any number of times. We’ve taken the best possible advice from the Australian Health  Protection Principal Committee, the AHPPC, wonderfully led by Professor Paul Kelly and before him  Brendan Murphy. We’ve taken that advice. The national cabinet process, we’ll discuss that with the  Premiers, with the six Premiers and the two Chief Ministers and the Prime Minister. They’ll have those  discussions and they’ll bring about the best outcome.



JOURNALIST

Given that we’ve had a couple of doughnut days, as I think they’re called, should the states all open their  borders?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, that’s, again, a matter for Premiers. I’ve never been in favour of borders being closed, but state  Premiers have done what they needed to do, what they thought they needed to do, to keep their  people safe. And I say again, we’ve done marvellously well as Australians. And I say again, too, thank you  to Australians for being their best selves, for exercising social distancing, for wearing masks when  required to do so, for making sure that they’ve self-isolated. And by and large Australians have complied  with those requests by health authorities, by Premiers, by Chief Ministers and by the Prime Minister. So  they’ve done the right thing. We respect them for it, and I respect the Premiers’ decisions to try to keep  their people as safe as possible and going forward that’s why the national cabinet process is so  important.



JOURNALIST

The Prime Minister visited in November and again in December. You’re here now. We’ve had the  announcement that there’s free car travel on the Spirit. Is there an early election in the air for this year?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

I’m a regular visitor to Tasmania. I’ve been coming to Tasmania since my wife Catherine and I visited  here in the 1980s, as she reminded me this morning. I looked a lot younger then apparently - I had  different coloured hair. But, you know, I love Tassie. And why wouldn’t you want to come to Tassie?  We’ve done, as Jonno Duniam championed, advocated for, fought for as determinedly as he always  does, that vehicle rebate. We’re making sure that - I promote Tasmania, of course. I know the Prime  Minister with his mullet-haired mate from the footy club up north, he loves coming to Tassie. You know,  why wouldn’t you want to come to Tasmania? It’s a great place to visit.

Mind you, that said, yesterday at this very time, yes, I was in a press conference getting my retinas burnt  out in 41-degree heat in the shade just about in the Northern Territory. I came from there to here. What  a wonderful country this is. What an amazing place. And that’s why I’m really delighted that so many  people, given the fact that they can’t travel overseas, are taking the opportunity to see such places as  the Top End, to see such beautiful places as Tasmania.

Now, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and I, we are big believers in Tasmania. We’re big believers in what  Peter Gutwein and his Government are doing for this State. And we want to make sure that through  COVID-19 recovery that Tasmania is helping to lead the way along with the other regions, along with the  other states and territories. The regions hold the key to the COVID recovery. And that’s why Jonno  Duniam is such a fighter for this particular area and for Tasmania in general. That’s why we’ll go on  visiting, we’ll go on delivering, we’ll go on investing in Tasmania and elsewhere.



JOURNALIST

The Tasmanian community depends quite heavily on social security payments. I think they’re the main  source of income for about 60 per cent of Tasmanians or it might be 40 per cent, sorry. Do you accept  that the changes to JobKeeper and JobSeeker will represent a big hit at a time when our recovery is just  starting?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, we can’t keep the assistance going forever. It was always scaleable, it was targeted, it was always  temporary. And Josh Frydenberg, the Treasurer, said that when he announced the JobKeeper and  JobSeeker arrangements. He very much said that. There are 50,000 jobs as identified by the Regional  Australia Institute. We want to get people back to work. And that’s why we’ve put in place those  measures, but that’s why we’ve also reduced taxes. That’s why we’ve also put in other measures to  benefit those people looking for work, to reconnect employees with employers, and that’s why we want  to get Australia back as fast as we can to some sort of pre-COVID level.

That’s why we’ve put in place the aviation assistance measures that, you know, now stretch to around  $2 billion. And that’s why we’ll of course continue to assess the situation. But, as Josh Frydenberg said  yesterday, we need that recovery to happen. Australians have done very well through the health  outcomes. I know that Minister Greg Hunt has been very pleased with, but there’s more work to do both  on the health front, more work to do both on the economic front, but all the way through we’ll be with  Australians and helping them and reassessing the situation as we go.



JOURNALIST

But does not reducing household incomes not only not be helpful to people but undercut the possibility  of an economic recovery?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, there’s always be people who, you know, for one reason or another slip through the cracks, and  that’s why we’ve got a welfare safety net system. There are also many jobs out there. I appreciate that,  you know, it’s not always easy for Australians to travel. I appreciate that it’s not always for Australians to  take up the job that might be on offer. But that job might be on offer might not be your forever job; but  it might be a stop gap in between finding that forever job. And we want people to look for those jobs,  whether it’s in agriculture, whether it’s in, you know, any of those other good paying jobs that are in  regional Australia right now. There are jobs out there. Please look for them if, you know, you have the  ability to do so. I appreciate that, yes, for some times are stuff and times will be tough going forward.  But that’s why we’ve got that welfare safety net. That’s why we’ve got all those provisions in place and  the highest minimum wage in the world. You know, we are a very generous nation, but the time to start  that recovery is very much now.



JOURNALIST

Given the number of Tasmanians who are on those social supports and the pain that those people are  going to feel this year, keeping in mind that Tasmania has capital city rental and house prices in a place  with regional wages, are you concerned that you’re going to be losing votes in the lead-up to the next  election on this?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, anybody who is casting a vote at any election, if they find a Liberal or National candidate on that  ballot paper should put a “1” beside their name. Because that way they will know that they have a  candidate fighting on their behalf for more jobs, for more infrastructure, for more investment for a  better future.



JOURNALIST

Just on a really left field note potentially, I don’t know if you’re familiar with the case of Joe the Pigeon  that came from America into Australia. But it’s been considered a biosecurity threat and is probably  going to be put down. Is that something that the high powers of the federal government to intervene  on? There has been a bit of backlash against that?



MICHAEL McCORMACK

I’m not aware of Joe the Pigeon, I’m sorry. I’m sure Joe the Pigeon has contributed mightily to the  economic outcomes of, you know, avarium bird life from whence Joe the Pigeon came. But, look, I’m  unable to give you an answer because I’m not aware of Joe’s plight or flight or future. Happy to look into

it and get back to you. Good luck, Joe. But if Joe has come in a way that has not met our strict  biosecurity measures, then bad luck, Joe. Either fly home or face the consequences. Thank you.
