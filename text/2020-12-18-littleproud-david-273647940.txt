$11 million investment to help Queensland   communities recover from bushfires

More than $11 million has been approved for a range of projects that will help with the  economic and social recovery in Queensland communities that were heavily impacted by  last year’s bushfires.

Minister for Emergency Management David Littleproud said 12 projects had been  approved in the second round of the $36.8 million Local Economic Recovery Program.

“The Local Economic Recovery (LER) Program is jointly funded by the Commonwealth  and Queensland Governments under the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements and  we are pleased to provide this extraordinary assistance,” Minister Littleproud said.

“The Queensland Bushfires last year had a major impact on many communities throughout  Queensland and it was compounded even further by the COVID-19 pandemic so it’s vital  we support them through these challenging times.

“The 12 projects have been approved across nine local government areas for a broad  range of projects that will inject valuable funding into the regions, while creating jobs,  producing enduring benefits and improving future resilience.

“Today’s announcement brings the total projects approved under the LER Program in  Queensland to 18, with a total value of over $17 million, with further projects still to be  announced,” he said.

Deputy Premier and Minister for State Development, Infrastructure, Local Government and  Planning Steven Miles said the impacted councils had identified priority projects that would  contribute to their recovery and longer-term resilience.

“This funding will be used to create jobs and invest in a vast array of projects that would  not have been possible without this vital funding,” Mr Miles said.

“The projects approved in this round, include walking trail and fire break upgrades, a  FireTech Laboratory in Noosa and upgrading electrical infrastructure to include fire  resistant poles.

“Community halls will also be upgraded. These upgrades will help communities connect  and socialise, but also mean the halls can be used as places of refuge and recovery hubs  during and after a disaster.

“We know from experience that recovery from disasters is most successful when it is  locally-led and supported at the state and federal levels and that is exactly what we are  doing with this program.

“Queenslanders impacted by last year’s bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic can rest  assured we will continue to work with them as they get back on their feet,” he said.   Funding and projects approved under the second round of the LER Program:
