SHOCKING ELDER ABUSE FIGURES HIGHLIGHT MORRISON GOVERNMENT

INACTION



New research from the Aged Care Royal Commission has revealed the shocking rates  of elder abuse in aged care homes under the Morrison Government.

The research shows almost 40 per cent of people living in Australian aged care facilities  experience elder abuse in the form of neglect, emotional abuse or physical abuse.

These figures confirm just how broken our country’s aged care system is under the  Morrison Government.

The Morrison Government has taken far too long to introduce a serious incident  response scheme that would respond to cases of assault and abuse in Australia’s aged  care system.

It has been more than three years since this scheme was first recommended by the  Australian Law Reform Commission following its landmark investigation of elder abuse  in Australia.

A separate review commissioned by the Government following the Oakden nursing  home tragedy also recommended introducing the scheme in 2017.

How can anyone trust this Government to properly respond to the Royal Commission  into Aged Care when it takes more than three years to respond to such an important  recommendation?

Labor has been calling for the implementation of this scheme since both reports were  released in 2017.

Australia’s aged care system was broken before the COVID-19 pandemic and this is  only putting extra stress on the system.

Day after day, the evidence mounts of serious neglect in aged care and all we see from

the Morrison Government is running away, passing the buck and not accepting  responsibility for its own failures.

Neglect. That’s the legacy of this Government when it comes to aged care.

Australians deserve better.
