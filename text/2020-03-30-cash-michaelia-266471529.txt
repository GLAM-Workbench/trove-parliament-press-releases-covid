NATIONAL CAREERS INSTITUTE GRANT FUNDING  APPLICATIONS OPEN TO IMPROVE CAREER ADVICE

The Morrison Government’s National Careers Institute has today opened applications for  grants up to the value of $700,000 for programs which will foster innovative partnerships  between industry, employers, schools and tertiary providers.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said the $10 million grants program will support projects that are designed to help job  seekers gain access to high-quality information about the pathways available through  vocational education and training (VET).

“This program will be a major boost for the career development sector. It is now more  important than ever that we find ways to boost the capacity and effectiveness of the sector to  connect job seekers with pathways towards in-demand jobs,” Minister Cash said.

“As part of supporting the workforce and the economy through the unprecedented disruption  caused by COVID-19, we are equipping all Australians with the best assistance to make  informed and rewarding decisions about future study options and career opportunities  available through VET.

Assistant Minister for Vocational Education, Training and Apprenticeships, The Hon Steve  Irons MP, said greater collaboration across traditional boundaries is also one of the best ways  we can improve career outcomes and education and training pathways.

“I encourage all interested parties to join together to develop innovative solutions that offer  improved career information and advice,” Assistant Minister Irons said.

Applications for grants of up to $350,000 per year over two years can be made until   30 June 2020.

Application forms and guidelines are available through www.business.gov.au/NCIP
