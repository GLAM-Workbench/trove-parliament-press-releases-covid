Appointment to the Australian Multicultural Council

Mr Eddie Woo has been appointed to the Australian Multicultural Council. The 12 member  Council provides advice to the Australian Government on multicultural affairs, integration and  social cohesion.

Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, Alex Hawke  MP, said Mr Woo will bring valuable experience to the Council, which includes leaders from a  range of business and civil society backgrounds.

“Mr Woo was selected for the Australian Multicultural Council on the basis of his expertise,  leadership and demonstrated commitment to social cohesion and multicultural Australia,” he  said.

“As citizens, we share a commitment to Australia and its people, and our shared values of  freedom, respect, fairness and equality of opportunity. Mr Woo has exemplified these values in  his actions,” Mr Hawke said.

Since receiving the Australian of the Year Local Hero Award in 2018, Mr Woo has continued his  innovative approach to teaching that has made mathematics more fun and accessible to school  students.

“I also thank the Australian Multicultural Council for its advice to Government in support of  national COVID-19 response efforts,” Minister Hawke said.

The 2020-21 Budget allocated $62.8 million to support Australia’s social cohesion and ensure  the values and institutions that unite us as Australians remain strong. This builds on the $71  million dollar package of social cohesion measures announced in March 2019.
