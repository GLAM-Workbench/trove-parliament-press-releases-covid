NATIONAL HARVEST VIRTUAL JOBS FAIR CONNECTS  JOB SEEKERS WITH EMPLOYERS

A virtual jobs fair showcasing employment opportunities across harvest regions nationally  will be held on Thursday 19 November 2020.

The National Harvest Virtual Jobs Fair, funded by the Australian Government, will bring  together job seekers and local businesses with jobs to offer in the country’s harvest regions.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said the virtual jobs fair will promote rural job opportunities.

“A range of presentations from employers and harvest providers will demonstrate what  harvest jobs are like, from picking to packing,” Minister Cash said.

“This jobs fair complements our Government’s recent Budget announcement of $17.4 million  in relocation support to attract workers to our farms and regions.

“As we see COVID-19 restrictions ease, the Government is committed to connecting job  seekers with businesses looking to hire.

“Creating jobs and boosting the skills of Australians to help them get back into work is at the  heart of the Morrison Government’s recovery plan and 2020-21 Budget.

“The National Harvest Virtual Jobs Fair is a must for anyone who wants to connect with  businesses currently recruiting.”

The Morrison Government has held jobs fairs in many locations around Australia with more  than 40,000 people having attended a fair since July 2018.

The National Harvest Virtual Jobs Fair is a free online event and willbe held from 1 pm to 5  pm (AEDT) on Thursday 19 November 2020.
