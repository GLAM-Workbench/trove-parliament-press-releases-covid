Providers urged to apply for a share in record infrastructure funding

Aged care providers are being reminded applications for a share of funding in the Australian  Government’s largest ever investment in residential aged care infrastructure will soon close.

Funding totalling $150 million is available to providers for capital grants and additional beds  as the Morrison Government continues to strengthen the sector and ensure the wellbeing of  older Australians.

Two thousand residential care places and 1028 short-term restorative care (STRC) places will  be made available as part of the 2020 Aged Care Approvals Round.

Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services, Richard Colbeck, said it was another  step forward to help providers deliver quality residential services where it’s needed most.

“The Australian Government is absolutely committed to ensuring our senior Australians are  provided with the best quality residential aged care possible,” Minister Colbeck said.

“That’s why we’re making the biggest investment in residential aged care infrastructure in  Australia’s history.

“This investment will not only improve the quality of residential care services in areas across  the country, it will also offer a boost to local economies through job creation in the aged care  and construction sectors.”

The residential care places in this ACAR are targeted to providers that can commence  delivering care within 18 months, Minister Colbeck said.

Priorities for the $150 million in grant funding include:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Upgrades to create more spacious rooms, increase privacy and decrease the need for  shared living quarters;

online, including those impacted by bushfires and COVID-19.

Application forms, guidance materials and other resources can be found here.
