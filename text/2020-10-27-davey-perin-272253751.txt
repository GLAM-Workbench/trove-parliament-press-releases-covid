GREEN LIGHT FOR DROUGHT RELIEF PROJECTS

IN SNOWY MONARO



A high-priority drought relief project is progressing in the Snowy Monaro Regional Council  in New South Wales, with funding approved to flow under the Australian Government’s  Drought Communities Programme (DCP) Extension.

Minister for Drought David Littleproud said he was pleased to see the local project is ready  to move forward.

“The Australian Government is providing $1 million to the Snowy Monaro Regional Council to  support upgrades and improvements to local infrastructure,” Minister Littleproud said.

“The project will provide long lasting benefits for the Snowy Monaro community which has  been significantly impacted by the drought.”

Nationals Senator for New South Wales Perin Davey said this funding will help the region get  back on its feet.

“Despite the recent welcome rains, we know the financial impacts of drought are still a major  factor within the community,” Senator Davey said.

“Programs like this, built on local needs and delivered by local councils, are key to supporting  local jobs and local economies.”

“This funding will not only stimulate the local economy, but also provide work for people  whose employment may have been impacted by drought.”

Project works include upgrades to the Cooma Truck Wash and Bombala Caravan Park,  installation of new play equipment at the Ginger Leigh Playground precinct in Bombala,  and development of an Adverse Events Plan.

Minister Littleproud said now more than ever, the Government is proud to support regional  Australia during the added challenge of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.

“The Government is aware of the added challenges presented by COVID-19. Communities  should rest assured the Government continues to have their back, with an economic and  health support package of $507 billion in assistance announced to date,” Minister  Littleproud said.

“This includes the $2.8 billion package to assist local government in the delivery of priority  projects with a focus on roads, community infrastructure upgrades and maintenance.

“Under this package, the $1.5 billion Local Road and Community Infrastructure Program,  and the bringing forward of $1.3 billion from the 2020-21 Financial Assistance Grant  payments will help communities battling the effects of COVID-19.

“DCP Extension projects, such as Snowy Monaro’s, deliver immediate cash injections to  communities to help keep locals employed, businesses open, money flowing through  drought-affected regional economies.

“The Government is standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our regional and rural communities  who have been doing it tough through drought and will be here to support them through  dedicated initiatives such as the DCP Extension.

“Drought doesn't just hurt farmers; it hurts small businesses and the wider community as  well, but with DCP Extension funding we can keep money flowing through areas that have  been affected.

“So far, the DCP Extension has funded over 500 projects, such as the construction of local  tourism assets and amenities blocks, delivery of a potable water supply, community  resilience events and employing local drought support officers.”
