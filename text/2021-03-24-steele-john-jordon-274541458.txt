DISABILITY ROYAL COMMISSION CONFIRMS MORE TIME IS NEEDED TO

FULFIL TERMS OF REFERENCE



Wednesday 24 March 2021

The Disability Royal Commission confirmed yesterday in Senate Estimates

that the Morrison government has yet to formally respond to their request for a

17 month extension, acknowledging they need more time to enable them to

fulfil the Terms of Reference.



Australian Greens Disability Rights spokesperson Senator Jordon Steele-John

said it was clear that the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of privacy protection

for witnesses had had a significant impact on the ability of the Royal

Commission to effectively do its job.



"This is not a question of budget constraints, it is simply a question of having

enough time to properly do their job," Steele-John said.



"Our Royal Commission has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19

pandemic. Public hearings were stopped for 6 months, as was outreach and

engagement into the community. When public hearings resumed they were,

and still are, closed to the general public.





"Important community engagement in WA, SA, NT and Tasmania

hasn't resumed and in remote and regional parts of Australia, it never even

began.



"Representatives of the Royal Commission confirmed last night that the

Commission has a desire to go to all states and territories, including remote

and regional areas of Northern and Central Australia 'subject to COVID-19'.



"The Royal Commission also acknowledged that an extension 'certainly would

allow us to have more hearings, do more engagement, receive more

submissions, undertake more private sessions and ultimately means that we

would fulfil our terms of reference'.



"It's now been six months since the Royal Commission requested a 17 month

extension and the Morrison government still have not even provided a formal

response. They must grant an extension now!"
