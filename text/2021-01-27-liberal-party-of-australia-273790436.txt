Australia’s COVID-19 vaccine information campaign begins

The Australian Government’s $23.9 million public information campaign to encourage  Australians to get a COVID-19 vaccine begins today.

The campaign will keep Australians fully informed and up to date about the safety and  effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines as they become available, including when, how and  where to get the jab.

This follows Australia’s first COVID-19 vaccine approval by the Therapeutic Goods  Administration - for the Pfizer vaccine.

From the start of the pandemic, the COVID-19 campaign has been a trusted source of  information for the community. The new vaccine campaign will build on this, providing  timely, transparent and credible information to all Australians.

The new campaign will be in three phases:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Reaffirm that COVID-19 vaccines have been put through our world-leading  independent approvals process, ensuring both the safety and efficacy of our vaccine  candidates

Ã¯ÂÂ· Provide information on how the vaccine will be rolled out, particularly to priority  groups, and dosage requirements.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Inform people about how and where to get vaccinated, dosage requirements, and  support vaccine uptake.

The roll-out will begin by providing protection to those who need it most - the elderly and  disabled, and frontline workers who are tirelessly working to save lives and protect lives.

The information in this campaign, based on expert, and independent, medical advice, will  help answer the questions people may have.

The campaign will run across a variety of mediums, including television, radio, press, digital,  social, mobile, search and out of home.

To ensure the campaign reaches all Australians, special committees representing Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people with a disability and the multicultural community  are informing the communication approach, ensuring communications are appropriate and  disseminated through the best communication channels to these communities.

Australia is a vaccination nation - we have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world.  Australians understand that vaccines work. They save lives. They improve lives. They protect  lives.

I am confident, given Australia's high vaccination coverage rates that Australians will take up  a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine in equally high numbers.

This campaign will help every Australian to understand how the vaccine works and how it  will keep them and their family safe.
