HARMONY DAY - INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ELIMINATION OF RACIAL

DISCRIMINATION



As we celebrate Harmony Day 2021, we must renew our commitment to multiculturalism,

ending racism and promoting respect for all.



Each year, Australians come together to celebrate Harmony Day on the United Nations

International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.



Multiculturalism is one of Australia's greatest achievements.



From 200 countries and speaking more than 260 languages - Australia's diversity is truly

one of our greatest strengths.



No matter who you are, where you were born or the language you first spoke, everyone

belongs in Australia.



The richness and diversity of languages and cultures in Australia must be recognised and

celebrated but it cannot be taken for granted.





Unfortunately, COVID has unleashed new strains of ugly racism in our communities.

Australia must recommit to being a place where everyone feels that they belong and where

no-one is left behind.



Federal Labor welcomes the Race Discrimination Commissioner's recently proposed anti-racism framework.



Racism ruins lives and divides entire communities, that’s why Labor has been calling for a

national anti-racism strategy for over a year.



It's not enough for the Government to simply condemn racism. We need a comprehensive

strategy to tackle racism through leadership and with financial support.



Words must be matched by action.



That’s why Federal Labor has commenced important policy work on a national anti-racism

strategy, focusing on empowering culturally and linguistically diverse communities and

changing attitudes through a national anti-racism campaign.
