INDEPENDENT CINEMAS CAN’T BE FORGOTTEN



The Morrison Government has forgotten the plight of Australia’s independent cinema sector,

which is warning many cinemas could go under when JobKeeper ends next month.



Today marks the launch of a week of action to draw attention to the dire situation faced by the

sector, which has been largely been ignored by the government during the COVID-19

pandemic.



Across Australia, there are more than 700 screens owned by independent operators. These

cinemas often operate in small and regional towns and provide much-needed local jobs, and

are loved by their communities.



Independent cinemas are a vital part of the screen ecosystem, helping Australian stories reach

the wider community.



The recent success of films like The Dry and Penguin Bloom demonstrate the enduring

popularity of Australian stories in cinemas, and “going to the movies” is as well-liked an activity

as ever.



According to Independent Cinemas Australia, many cinemas are in danger of going under if

they do not receive ongoing support beyond the JobKeeper cliff at the end of March.





Scott Morrison cannot ignore this sector and its pleas for help.



Independent cinemas provide communities around Australia with both local jobs and Australian

stories - both of these are too important to lose. Time for the Morrison Government to act.
