LABOR SUPPORTS CONTINUED AGREEMENTS WITH ASTRAZENECA



Labor supports the Federal Government in continuing their engagement and agreement

with the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine candidate.



News today that AstraZeneca has ‘voluntarily paused vaccination to allow review of safety

data by an independent committee’ is a process to be expected during clinical trials to

ensure vaccine safety.



We understand the relevant data monitoring safety board should provide a full explanation

of any adverse reactions of the vaccine and we appreciate the transparency of

AstraZeneca as they investigate findings. We also wish the best for any trial participant

suffering adverse reactions.



We support comments by the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth today on

waiting “to see exactly what the adverse reaction was and whether they attribute it to the

vaccine”.



There is no guarantee that the two deals now secured by the Government, the University

of Oxford/AstraZeneca and University of Queensland/CSL vaccines are the silver bullet to

COVID-19.



Thus the Federal Government must expand their investment in a range of potential

COVID-19 vaccines.





Over six billion doses of vaccines through more than fifty agreements were secured by

other countries before Australia secured agreements for these two vaccines.



The Government also needs to plan now for how we will manufacture and distribute

enough doses for all Australians in the event that it is a different vaccine candidate that is

most effective.



Labor repeats our call to the Government to engage and invest in vaccine development —

at home, in our region and around the world.
