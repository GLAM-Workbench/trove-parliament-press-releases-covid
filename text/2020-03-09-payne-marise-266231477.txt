MEDIA RELEASE  VISIT TO THE USA



I will visit the United States from 9-12 March to meet with a range of US counterparts  and Australian business representatives. I will also discuss our respective responses to  coronavirus and possible opportunities for co-operation.

My visit will also highlight the long-standing Australian and US strategic and business  links that underpin our alliance.  In Alabama, I will be the guest of honour at the Austal  shipyards for the keel laying of the second warship to bear the proud name ‘USS  Canberra’.  At the invitation of the Trump administration, I have been appointed the  warship’s sponsor, which is a whole of life commission.  Austal is a world leading naval  shipbuilder entrusted with constructing the littoral combat ships for the US Navy. The  success of Austal showcases Australian technical innovation and business expertise and  underscores the deep strategic relationship between Australia and the US, uniquely  reflected in the naming of the second USS Canberra - in honour of HMAS Canberra, lost  at the Battle of Savo Island in 1942 along with three US heavy cruisers.

In Washington I will meet with United States’ Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and  other administration officials, to discuss our shared economic and security interests,  including infrastructure needs in the Indo-Pacific. In particular, I will discuss Australia’s  stepped up engagement in the Pacific to highlight the importance we place on  strengthening relationships and building prosperity in the region.

While in Washington I will also meet a range of senior US officials and congressional  leaders. I will thank members of Congress for the strong US support during the  summer’s bushfires, and again convey Australia’s condolences on the loss of 3 US  firefighters.
