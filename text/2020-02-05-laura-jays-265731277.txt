TRANSCRIPT

INTERVIEW WITH LAURA JAYS, FIRST EDITION ON SKY NEWS  5 February 2020







E&EO

Subjects: Leadership, Ministerial Appointments, Bushfires, Regional Development;

LAURA JAYS:

You’ve been given the support of the party room for a third time, what do you plan to do with it?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Indeed, I put myself up for re-election to the National Party three times in less than two years and  three times the party has endorsed me. And going forward, as has always been, what I've wanted to  do is to make sure that regional Australians are the focus. Regional Australians don't want to have  people who are sent here to Canberra being self-indulgent. They don’t want people who are sent  here to Canberra talking about themselves. They want their issues addressed. That's always been my  focus, whether it's the drought, whether it's the bushfires. Whatever the case is, making sure that  the infrastructure is delivered, building dams, the Inland Rail, that has been my sole focus. I've never  concentrated on the leadership speculation that has so fascinated some sections of the media and  indeed, I appreciate that yesterday was probably necessary to take place it's taken place. Barnaby  has pledged his loyalty. He said he won’t re-challenge. We now need to draw a line under it and  move on and make sure as members of the National Party, we concentrate on the people who  matter most and that's the people we serve.

LAURA JAYS:

Do you believe him?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Yep, absolutely. I take people, particularly country people. I take them on their word, you have to.









LAURA JAYS:

Have you been sent a message by your party room though, that things do dramatically need to  change. And at the outset of this interview, I didn't hear anything new of what you weren't saying  before yesterday's vote. So do you have any dramatic changes in mind?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, when you say dramatic last May, in the election, we returned every one of the 16 National  Party seats, two of which - Cowper for Pat Conaghan and Mallee for Anne Webster - were seats  which we transitioned from sitting incumbents, and we retained those seats and we did that  because I went round, each and every one of those seats. The National Party members who put their  hands up spoke to people, more importantly, listened to people, and worried and concentrated on  what those people wanted. Not necessarily any other agendas, but just making sure that for each  and every electorate because they're all different, that delivery was done for that particular  electorate and you look at Ken O’Dowd and George Christensen and Michelle Landry, they now  enjoy margins that they could once have only dreamt about. I think that comes also from the top, it  starts at the top. And I know that those electorates and people in those electorates were very  pleased to see their National Party People returned. And I know that when I went to those  electorates they were very pleased to see me turn up too, because we turned up and we listened to  them about the things that were important to them. Not necessarily the things that were important  maybe to the Canberra bubble, but the things that were important to them.

LAURA JAYS:

Mr McCormack, you cannot blame the Canberra bubble. Surely, you read the papers. You’ve seen  what your colleagues have had to say about you both publicly and privately. There is - it's not just a  media fiction, there is some frustration with the way you conduct yourself with your leadership. So  what are you going to change? Is there anything policy wise you have in mind?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, when you say conduct yourself with your leadership - during the summer I visited just about  every forefront from September right through. I didn't take a whole heap of television cameras with  me and I got out there. I put my arms around people. I listen to what they wanted and when I went  to Southarm, and Rebecca Beverley told me that she needed a counsellor, I made sure that I got  straight on to Greg Hunt right there and then and we had one for that community. When I went to  other areas and I needed a generator. I got that for them. I think that sort of delivery is very much  appreciative and yes, none of us are perfect and of course as a politician and as a Leader, I’m not  perfect. We're all flawed. I never suggested that I was perfect. And yes, we can all take learnings  from these sorts of experiences and I will but I can’t work any harder. I may be able to work a little  bit smarter perhaps but I can't work any harder. I'm out there every day delivering for regional  Australians whether that is the Inland Rail or whether it's Dungowan Dam or heightening the wall at  Wyangla. Making sure that Emu Swamp Dam is going to be delivered in Stanthorpe. Making sure  that those vital water infrastructure projects are delivered in the north of Queensland. That's the  sort of leader that I'm going to be and continue to be.







LAURA JAYS:

Okay, is the National Party capable of mending these rifts? And I sense a bit of frustration about  what I just put to you has anyone actually brought these things up with you personally in one to one  meetings rather than doing it through the media?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, you're always going to get free, frank and unfiltered advice from colleagues and from time to  time, and that's welcomed. I do get disappointed sometimes with some of the backgrounding that  does get done and that’s not just National Party members doing it. I think a lot of politicians do it.  I've never been one to when a journalist has said to me just on background. I've always put my name  to everything I've ever said. And that's always been my style. Maybe it's because I'm an ex-journalist,  I don’t know and I think that if people are going to say something and have a view put your name to  it, and whether you're National, Liberal, Labor, Greens, whatever the case might be, put your name  to what you say. If you believe in it that much put your name behind it.

LAURA JAYS:

There's a big schism in the National Party now where's the evidence that you as leader and your  party is capable of mending this rift from the what we read this morning, you've only rewarded your  backers.

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

I haven't rewarded anybody. I haven't even decided who is going to be in the ministry. I'm sorry that  Matt Canavan has stood down, he has done an excellent job as the Resources Minister, I'm sorry,  that Bridget McKenzie - that this has happened. She's done a great job as Australia's first female  Agriculture Minister. I'm very, very pleased that I'm in a National Party, which we've got so much  talent. So much talent and so much talent to draw upon when we do look at these ministry positions  from time to time, but we can't all be in the ministry and those…

LAURA JAYS:

Well you didn’t mention Barnaby Joyce there. He is arguably one of your most well-known and  talented backbenches. Why didn't you consider or are you considering putting him on the front  bench and back in the cabinet?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, I'm considering all of those who currently aren't in the ministry, except of course Matt Canavan  who has himself tendered in his resignation of his commission, and of course, Bridget McKenzie,  who has done the same. But I haven't determined who is going to be in the ministry as yet.  Yesterday, I had a number of important meetings and of course, yesterday the focus, as it quite  rightly should have been on the bushfires, and particularly those bushfire volunteers and firefighters  who lost their lives.







LAURA JAYS:

Will you be going to question time today with those positions still vacant?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, it depends on how much work I have to do this morning.

LAURA JAYS:

Is this not a priority?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

I won’t be making any announcements before question time, I don't believe at this stage. I still have  to talk to a few colleagues as I say, yesterday was a very busy day and we had very important  meetings about Coronavirus and other issues. And, of course, I know the Prime Minister is going to  be addressing National Suicide Prevention in the ADF very soon. And these are important measures.  These are the sorts of things that people, the voters, constituents, and people out there want us to  be addressing and we are.

LAURA JAYS:

Apparently according to some of your colleagues, Nationals voters want you to talk more about  what you're going to do to support coal. And we heard that from Matt Canavan, he suggested that  you weren't doing enough to fight for coal. So what are you doing?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

I've always, always made sure that that the importance of coal was recognised - $62 billion of  exports that provide a lot for our state schools and state hospitals. 55,000 jobs, indeed two thirds of  our energy needs. I tell you, you can look at a lot of transcripts that I've said. You can look at a lot of  interviews. I've never shied away from the fact that coal is important for Australia. And I appreciate  that Matt Canavan of course has talked a bit more about coal than I did because he was the  Resources Minister, Minister for Northern Australia, where coal is such an important resource  because it underpins the economies of so, so many communities. But there are lots of things as the  National Party Leader as the Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Regional Development that I  talk about not least of which of course is coal, but importantly, Inland Rail, building more dams,  they’re the sorts of things that I'm going to certainly continue to be focused on.

LAURA JAYS:

He and others want you to have a bigger fight with the Liberals perhaps it's a bit of product  differentiation. Where have you differed from the Liberals in the last year on policy.

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:    Well, those discussions will remain between Scott Morrison and I. I don't believe that airing dirty  laundry…











LAURA JAYS:

[Interrupts] No, no, no, I am not asking for dirty laundry. I am asking for you to point to some  outcomes as to where you differed and where you have been able to get your point of view actually  put into place?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:    Well, indeed, since I came into this position the Rural Medical School for the Murray Darling has  been established. Now, that was never something that the Liberal Party, indeed that The  Government was pushing for. But it certainly was a National Party policy going to benefit people  who live in regional areas who have to sometimes wait a long time to see a GP or indeed, getting a  car when they're ill and driving several hours to see a GP. Well, I brokered it. I brokered that.  Previous leaders were not able to bring that about, but I did and I'm really proud of that and I was  really so proud when I went to Orange recently where that first rural medical school is being built  between Charles Sturt University and Western Sydney University. A very good collaboration there,  which is going to benefit that community. And I know elsewhere that that rural Medical School  Network established in the Murray Darling is going to make such a difference in the future for  people who need to see a GP quicker than they can now. More doctors for the bush - trained in the  bush.

LAURA JAYS:

Okay, last year, the Nats overwhelmingly wanted to have an extra $1 billion spent on drought. From  what I can see in the end, you only got a fraction of that. Minimum milk prices, promise scoping  study for the [inaudible], Murray Darling water reallocation. Have you been too slow to act on these  things?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

A lot of challenges a lot of opportunities. I will just pick you up on one thing a minimum milk price  that does worry me a bit. Your floor price for milk - sometimes that becomes the accepted norm.  When the industry - and it will pick up - but milk is something which I know Bridget McKenzie made  sure the code of conduct and everything else that she did in this space was as it should be. And as  the dairy industry itself wanted it to be. We've delivered that with that. We can't make it rain. But  certainly we can build dams. And certainly with even floods expected later this week, you know what  a shame we haven't got some of those water infrastructure measures in place to actually capture  that water when it falls because it will rain again, and we will have good seasons return. What we  need to do is make sure that we've got the water infrastructure in place. That's what I'm doing.  Signed the three intergovernmental agreements. Not easy, particularly with two of the Labor states  with the Inland Rail making such a difference for regional communities. There's been a lot we've  ticked off in the last year and a lot we're going to be taking off in the next years to come.

LAURA JAYS:

Well fairly or unfairly in recent days you've been referred to as ‘Michael Who’, ‘That Guy’ and even  ‘Boring’ what would you prefer to be referred as going forward?









MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, it's funny because you know when you get up and have an argument in Parliament with Joel  Fitzgibbon, you get accused of being shouty and angry. Sometimes you get accused of going too mild  and I don't think there has been too many other Deputy Prime Minister’s who have dressed up as  Elvis to support a community affected by drought, such as Parkes which have 25,000 visitors for that  festival. So I don't think you can accuse me of being too boring. Those who know me, they certainly  don't say I'm too boring. I'm just happy to be Michael. I am who I am. I don't try to be Barnaby Joyce,  I don't try to be Warren Truss. Every National Party Leader has brought different things to the table.  But every National Party Leader has always, always made sure that the important thing is not them.  The important thing is regional Australians. Those people who we serve those people at the moment  currently affected by drought. Those farmers who've lost everything through the bushfires all their  businesses, in some cases their loved ones. That's my whole and sole focus.

LAURA JAYS:

Well, perhaps we’ll see a little bit more of Michael Elvis, who knows. Thanks so much for your time.

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:    Maybe not, I think some people might not think that is such a good thing. Thanks, Laura. Thank you
