PROJECTS BIG AND SMALL TO BOOST RECOVERY IN

BUSHFIRE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES

Councils, community members and local business groups are shaping the long-term recovery of  Victoria’s bushfire-affected regions, with the Commonwealth and Victorian Government announcing  a $68.6 million fund to drive regional recovery and back key local community projects.

Commonwealth Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management David Littleproud and  Victorian Minister for Police and Emergency Services Lisa Neville today said the Local Economic  Recovery program will back both large projects to boost business, jobs and industry resilience across  these regions and smaller, local-level projects to support community recovery after the fires.

“Communities have suffered due to drought, bushfire and now COVID, and the aim of this program  is about creating jobs, backing businesses, and supporting communities by giving the green light to  key local projects”, Minister Littleproud said.

“Bushfire recovery is a long-term journey, and with the clean-up complete, modular houses rolling  out, and millions in grants already paid out, this funding will support community recovery, grow  businesses and jobs over the coming months and years and make industries more resilient to  disasters in the future”, Minister Neville said.

While the Victorian Government is currently working with councils, businesses and locals to identify  the main focus areas that are integral to the region’s broader economic recovery, Minister Littleproud  and Minister Neville were proud to congratulate the first five local-level community projects to receive  funding under the Local Economic Recovery program. The projects include:

Ã¯ÂÂ· $1,080,075 to begin work upgrading existing community facilities across East Gippsland,  such as public halls and recreation reserve buildings, so they better meet the needs of  communities. There will be works such as ember proofing, electrical upgrades and satellite  communication and WIFI upgrades at community halls and facilities right across the region,  including Wairewa Hall, Genoa Public Hall, Clifton Creek Community Public Hall, Ensay  Memorial Hall and more.

Ã¯ÂÂ· $190,000 to restore and expand the Cudgewa tennis facility to provide the community with  low cost space for recreation, community gatherings and events to build and sustain  community connection.

Ã¯ÂÂ· $128,700 to re-establish a tree-lined avenue in Tintaldra commemorating the sacrifice and  service of residents in World War I and the township’s local heroism and resilience during  the 2020 bushfires.

Ã¯ÂÂ· $120,000 to build a 19.5 metre pedestrian bridge joining Harrietville with the east branch of  the Ovens, to support tourism and mobility.  Ã¯ÂÂ· $40,000 to create three large murals in Mount Beauty to reflect community pride and create  a significant new point of interest for tourists traveling through the town.

“These local projects are shovel-ready, they are backed by the community and they will make a big  difference to fire affected locations”, Minister Littleproud said.

“We’ll be funding major economic initiatives across these regions as part of this $68.6 million  program, but we can’t forget that local-level projects like these are also essential to helping  communities recover.”

“We’ve always said that a successful recovery is one that’s shaped and supported by the community,  and that’s exactly what the Local Economic Recovery program is all about”, Minister Neville said.

Charlie Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Alpine Shire Council, said the announcement was “great  news for Alpine Shire and will deliver community priorities in the recovery from the impacts of recent  bushfires.”

Dominic Sandilands, Chair of the Upper Murray Community Recovery Committee located within  Towong Shire, said “there's a lot we can achieve with these funds at a local-level and we've been  happy to work closely with government on those decisions - because bushfire-affected communities  like ours know what's needed most.”

Graham Symons, President of the newly elected Omeo Region Community Recovery Association in  East Gippsland, said “we're working closely with government to make sure this funding can support  the local community projects we need in East Gippsland.”

Anthony Basford, the Chief Executive Officer of East Gippsland Shire, said "we are pleased to  receive this funding that will benefit the East Gippsland community."

The Local Economic Recovery program is jointly funded by the Commonwealth and Victorian  Governments. Funding will be released in stages over the next 12 to 18 months so applicants have  time to plan and prepare. Funding will be allocated across the two categories of regional economic  initiatives and local community projects.

The Commonwealth and Victorian Governments have also provided millions in grants to businesses  across East Gippsland and North East Victoria. As at 25 September 2020, more than 2,100 small  businesses and primary producers have received a $10,000 bushfire support grant to cover lost  income, and over 500 directly-impacted small businesses and primary producers have shared in  more than $30 million in additional grants to help rebuild their enterprises.
