Greens call for urgent independent review into vaccine rollout

The Australian Greens are calling for an urgent independent review into the  serious and widespread problems with Australia’s vaccine rollout.

“The vaccine rollout for which both the Federal and State Governments have  responsibility is having more than so called “teething problems” and these are  having real-world consequences with the latest Covid-19 outbreaks spreading  in Queensland and threatening in NSW,” Greens spokesperson on Health  Senator Rachel Siewert said.

“Targets have well and truly been missed. There are low supplies of vaccine  and some of what vaccine is available is apparently sitting unused. It appears  there is poor communication between levels of Government, and some doctors  are reported to be requiring pre-vaccination consultations. Front line workers  and vulnerable people are being let down. We are a month into the vaccine  rollout and we still haven’t vaccinated all of our frontline workers, aged care and  disability care staff.

“It appears that the only way to get Governments to take responsibility for these  failures is through an urgent and rapid independent review to identify and fix the  current issues.

“We need to get this right. Australians deserve answers.”
