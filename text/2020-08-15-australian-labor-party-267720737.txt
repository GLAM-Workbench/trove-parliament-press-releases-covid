EQUIVALENT OF 130,000 RETAIL JOBS ON THE LINE:  MORRISON’S CHRISTMAS JOBSEEKER SNAPBACK

The equivalent of 130,000 Australian retail jobs are on the line if Scott Morrison

returns the rate of the JobSeeker payment to its old base rate.



The Coronavirus supplement - currently received by over 2.2 million

Australians on working-age payments - is scheduled to end in December.



The JobSeeker and other working age payments will return to its old base rate

of $40 per day.



It has been estimated that out-of-work Australians will spend $326.9 million per

fortnight from their Coronavirus supplement from September, based on data on

the spending habits of social security recipients.



This is the equivalent of ripping $8.5 billion from the Australian retail sector in a

year.



The Australian Bureau of Statistics released its Average Weekly Earnings

figures for May on Thursday, which shows the average full time retail adult

worker earns $2,519.60 per fortnight.*



This means that the estimated $326.9 million hit to the retail sector from Scott

Morrison’s scheduled JobSeeker snapback is the equivalent of over 129,700

jobs in the Australian retail sector.



This includes over:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 38,000 retail jobs in New South Wales

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 31,700 retail jobs in Victoria

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 29,200 retail jobs in Queensland

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 13,900 retail jobs in Western Australia

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 9,900 retail jobs in South Australia

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 3,000 retail jobs in Tasmania

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 1,900 retail jobs in the Territory



The retail sector employs an estimated 1.18 million Australians - or one in ten

Australian workers.**



The Australian retail workforce contracted by 108,000 jobs, down from 1.29

million workers in the same period last year.**



It’s going to be a very difficult, uncertain and anxious Christmas for millions of

Australians.



Scott Morrison could deliver them some certainty by announcing a permanent

increase to JobSeeker.



Scott Morrison’s scheduled Christmas JobSeeker snapback threatens the

livelihoods of thousands of Australian workers in our retail sector, as well as



placing millions of Australians at risk of poverty and hardship.



It threatens the viability of thousands of small and medium business

enterprises.
