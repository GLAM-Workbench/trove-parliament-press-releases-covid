Tariff-ic start to 2021 for Australia’s farmers

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ New Year’s tariff cuts build on huge benefits Free Trade Agreements have  already delivered for Australia’s agricultural, food and fisheries exporters  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Free Trade Agreements deliver further diversified trade opportunities for  Australian exporters

It’s a happy new year for Australian agricultural and seafood exporters, as significant tariff cuts  and improved market access on a range of commodities traded across the Americas and Asia  take effect.

Minister for Agriculture David Littleproud said 2021 will be a huge opportunity for our  agricultural, food and fisheries exporters, with the further tariff reductions a boost to industry’s  aim of achieving $100 billion in farmgate value by 2030.

Following the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement’s  (IA-CEPA) entry into force on 5 July 2020, more than 99 per cent of Australian goods exported  to Indonesia enter duty free or under improved and preferential arrangements.

Building on this, from 1 January 2021 Tariff Rate Quotas will increase for live cattle, feed grain  and citrus exports to Indonesia.

Tariffs on lamb and beef to Korea, some wine products and barley to Mexico and refined sugar  to Canada will all fall in 2021, while exporters to Peru will benefit from tariff cuts on beef and  sparkling wine as well as increased quotas for rice, dairy, sugar and sorghum.

On 14 January 2021 remaining tariffs for seafood exports to Vietnam will continue to drop to  around 8 per cent, ahead of their complete elimination on 14 January 2022.

“The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and  other Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) forged by the Australian Government were delivering for  our agricultural, food and fisheries exporters.” Minister Littleproud said.

“Korea is Australia’s fourth largest agricultural partner, and Indonesia our fifth largest—the  FTAs we have with these nations alone are worth billions to Australian farmers, creating jobs  and supporting rural and regional communities.

“The broad range of export markets under these FTAs, along with these continued  improvements with tariff reductions, will help to stimulate growth and investment, diversifying  our export trade and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The total value of Australia’s exports to CPTPP economies for agricultural and food  commodities was $8.4 billion in 2019-20.

“The CPTPP delivered immediate as well as ongoing tariff reductions to enhance market  access across the Americas and Asia. It covers many of Australia’s key agricultural and food  export commodities, including wine, beef, dairy, wheat and sugar.”
