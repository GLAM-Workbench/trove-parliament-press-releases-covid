LABOR WELCOMES DATA ALLOWANCE INCREASE FOR SATELLITE

NBN SERVICES



Labor welcomes steps by NBNCo to increase data allowances for Satellite

customers in regional and remote Australia.



Services delivered using Satellite NBN technology are subject to a fair data

usage policy to manage capacity limitations during busy periods.



The announcement today will increase data allowances on standard SkyMuster

plans by 45GB a month, for up to three months.



Further, from 1 April, Skymuster Plus plans will unmeter traffic across a broader

range of non-video streaming related applications.



These developments supplement a temporary capacity boost for retailers to

support the needs of Australian internet users over this testing COVID-19

period.



Labor welcomes these steps which are a positive development for nearly

100,000 regional and remote Australian households which rely on the Satellite



NBN service.
