Government support for the wings across Australia



The Minister for Agriculture and Emergency Management has welcomed the nearly $200  million boost for regional and remote aviation as part of the Federal Government’s support  to Australia’s aviation sector during the COVID-19 crisis.

Minister Littleproud said this boost will mean that important links are maintained to the  bush making sure we save lives, jobs and communities.

“These are unprecedented times but those in rural Australia can take comfort in the  knowledge that this is a government that is calm and methodical in this crisis,” Minister  Littleproud said.

“Today’s announcement is about making sure domestic air freight makes it to all parts of  the country.

“It’s about getting critical medical supplies and services to those who need them,  regardless of whether it is COVID-19 related or not.

“And that essential workers in regional and remote Australia get to work and keep the  economies of the regions and Australia ticking over.

“The announcement also gives security to those who work in regional aviation by  underwriting the operating costs for airlines on selected routes.

“The Federal Government recognises the crucial role the aviation industry plays outside  the capital cities and wants to ensure the planes continue to link places right across the  nation.

“The wings across Australia are supported by the Federal Government.”
