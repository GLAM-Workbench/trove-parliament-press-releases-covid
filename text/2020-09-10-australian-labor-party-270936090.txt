AUSTRALIA POST HAS SERIOUS QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

The Australia Post CEO has serious questions to answer, following bizarre and disturbing  revelations that she intervened to help Pauline Hanson send divisive material to public  housing residents in lockdown in Melbourne.

Senator Hanson’s wrong and hateful remarks about public housing tenants saw her get  sacked from morning TV.

At the same time, Australia Post was prepared to help Hanson add injury to insult to  vulnerable people, while they were battling coronavirus.

The truth is, Scott Morrison and the Australia Post CEO, Christine Holgate, relied on a  dodgy Senate voting deal with Pauline Hanson to cut postal services, which Labor  opposed from the outset.

It’s extraordinary that instead of prioritising prompt and reliable delivery of mail and  parcels, Ms Holgate was more concerned with assisting Pauline Hanson push her  inflammatory and divisive agenda.

We need to get to the bottom of why the Australia Post CEO was working so hard to  please Pauline Hanson.
