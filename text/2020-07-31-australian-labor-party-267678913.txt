E&OE TRANSCRIPT  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  OVERSEAS PASSENGER TERMINAL, CIRCULAR QUAY  FRIDAY, 31 JULY 2020

SUBJECTS: Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton need to come clean over the  Ruby Princess; Federal Government fighting the NSW Special  Commission of Inquiry into the Ruby Princess.

KRISTINA KENEALLY, DEPUTY LABOR LEADER IN THE SENATE AND  SHADOW MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS: Well, Scott Morrison and Peter  Dutton need to come clean and they need to come clean today. What these  Government documents show is that Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton had been  covering up the events that happened on the Ruby Princess.

When Scott Morrison said his Government would “cooperate” with the New  South Wales Special Commission of Inquiry, he wasn't telling the truth. It was  just another marketing line from Scott Morrison. What these Government  documents show is that the Morrison Government has been fighting a legal  summons from Bret Walker, the New South Wales Special Commissioner of  Inquiry into the Ruby Princess. The Morrison Government has been refusing to  allow Federal officials to appear at the Special Commission of Inquiry and to  answer questions in public, questions from the Commissioner, about what  happened on the Ruby Princess.

Now, what these Government documents reveal is what Scott Morrison and  Peter Dutton have been trying to cover up, and that is it was Federal  Government officials - Australian Border Force and Federal Department of  Agriculture - who were onboard the Ruby Princess in the morning of 19 March.  They show that Australian Border Force officials mistook flu tests for COVID  tests. They misunderstood that when people tested negative for the flu, they  hadn't yet tested negative for coronavirus. These Government documents show  that Federal Agriculture officials did not administer the checklist for passengers



with illness to detect for coronavirus. And these Government documents show  that it is the Australian Border Force that gave the green light, the approval, for  people to disembark the Ruby Princess. 2,700 passengers, to leave the Ruby  Princess, to spread across Australia, spreading coronavirus.

Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton need to come clean and they need to come  clean today. They need to say what they know and when they knew it. They  need to explain why the Morrison Government is fighting a legal summons for  Federal officials to appear before the New South Wales Special Commission of  Inquiry. Today, the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, should direct Federal  officials to front up to that Special Commission of Inquiry and answer the  Commissioner's questions.

But, most importantly, the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, and Peter Dutton, the  Home Affairs Minister, should offer an apology. An apology to the frontline  officers, those Australian Border Force officers who were given no training or  support to manage a global pandemic aboard cruise ships. To the hundreds of  Australians who contracted coronavirus from the Ruby Princess wave. And  most importantly, the Prime Minister should apologise to the dozens of  Australians whose family members died. Let's not forget here, there are over 30  deaths from the Ruby Princess. That is Australians - mothers and fathers,  husbands and wives, brothers, sisters, loved ones who died because of  coronavirus aboard the Ruby Princess. The Morrison Government failed to stop  this one boat that mattered. For a Government that prides itself on border  security, it's time for them to own up to their mistakes. It is time for them to  apologise, to apologise for failing to stop the one boat that mattered.
