TEN AGED CARE HOMES ACROSS VICTORIA THREATENED WITH  CLOSURE

Shocking new evidence has revealed that by early August ten aged care homes in Victoria  were managing COVID-19 infection outbreaks so badly they had been threatened with  closure.

Across the homes there were already dozens of older Australians who had tragically  passed away and hundreds of residents who were infected with COVID-19.

This new evidence is in direct contrast to Scott Morrison’s heartless claim in Parliament  this week that the impact of COVID-19 was only ‘severe and completely unacceptable’ in  four homes.

“… in four cases the impact has been severe and completely unacceptable. Again, I offer  my apologies to the residents and families of those affected in those facilities. It was not  good enough.”  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ SCOTT MORRISON, QUESTION TIME, 24 AUGUST 2020

The aged care regulator threated to revoke the approval of all ten homes to deliver care  because there was ‘an immediate and severe risk to the safety, health and well-being of  care recipients’.

How is this acceptable in Scott Morrison’s view?

It is disgusting the Prime Minister thinks the impact of dozens of residents dying and  homes being threatened with closure isn’t ‘severe’.

The Prime Minister is totally out of touch with the hundreds of Australian families who have  been impacted by the aged care crisis and are grieving the loss of loved ones.

He should unreservedly apologise for his failure to every single one of these Australians  instead of walking away from taking responsibility.

Incredibly the Prime Minister continues to stand by his failed Minister for Aged Care,  Richard Colbeck.

The Minister for Aged Care is not across basic details, he’s not in Cabinet and he’s been  cut out of the decision-making process. He walks away from democratic scrutiny.





The Morrison Government has been behind the eight ball on aged care for years and we  are now seeing the tragic impact of this with COVID-19.
