THE HON JOEL FITZGIBBON MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCES  MEMBER FOR HUNTER



MINISTERIAL APPOINTMENTS

I congratulate both David Littleproud and Keith Pitt on their ministerial appointments. It was  a mistake to remove David Littleproud from the agriculture portfolio and Labor welcomes  his re-appointment.

David Littleproud was denied the portfolio following the 2019 election because he diverged  too far from the National Party playbook and its failed populism and pork-barrelling  guidance. His challenge this time will be to take the Prime Minister and his colleagues with  him on a reform journey to turn around the flat-lining productivity and poor profitability in  the food and fibre sector.

The Morrison Government has no national plan for the agriculture sector and no coherent  national plan for the ongoing drought. Despite some welcome rain, the drought is very  much still with us. David Littleproud’s first act should be to stop cutting farming families off  Farm Household Allowance.

Labor will work with David Littleproud on any reform agenda in pursuit of sustainable  profitability in the agriculture sector. The Government can’t keep claiming the National  Farmers Federation’s plan as its own. In the face of challenges from drought, bushfires,  biosecurity threats, trade wars, and the Coronavirus, the sector deserves better.

Former Minister McKenzie promised she’d address the shortcomings of the agriculture,  research and innovation frameworks. Sadly she failed to deliver. David Littleproud must  now do so.

As in agriculture, Labor will seek to work with new resources Minister Keith Pitt to grow  sustainable profitability and jobs in the resources sector, which delivers so much economic  wealth to Australia’s economy.
