NATIONAL CABINET

The National Cabinet met again today to discuss Australia’s COVID-19 response, recent progress  following the Victorian outbreak, easing restrictions (including international border measures), helping  Australians prepare to go back to work in a COVID-safe environment and getting the economy moving  again.

National Cabinet continues to work together to address issues and find solutions to the health and  economic consequences of COVID-19. Australia has done well on both the health and economic fronts  compared to most countries around the world.

The Acting Chief Medical Officer, Professor Paul Kelly, provided an update on the latest epidemiological  data and medical advice in relation to COVID-19.

There have been more than 27,000 confirmed cases in Australia and, sadly, 905 people have died. There  are now around 220 active cases in Australia, a decrease from around 1,100 cases five weeks ago. There  continues to be differences in testing rates between states and territories, and National Cabinet agreed  on the importance of enhanced testing. More than 8.4 million tests have been undertaken in Australia.

National Cabinet noted the increase in COVID-19 cases in many countries and the comparative strength  of Australia’s effort in addressing COVID compared to most other developed economies.

National Cabinet noted the 2020-21 Budget and the collective work needed across the Federation to  facilitate economic recovery measures. National Cabinet thanked the Council on Federal Financial  Relations for its work and noted further work is underway to coordinate the federation-wide economic  response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to drive a more productive economic recovery.

National Cabinet will meet again on Friday 13 November 2020.

Framework for National Reopening - A COVID Normal Australia

The Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, the Australian  Capital Territory and the Northern Territory agreed in-principle to a new ‘Framework for National  Reopening Australia by Christmas’ (document attached), building on and enhancing the 3-Step  Framework for a COVID Safe Australia developed in May 2020.

Western Australia did not agree to the National Framework for Reopening, specifically the domestic  border and international arrival proposals.

The Framework will provide the Australian community and businesses with a way forward where  Australians can live and work in a COVID Normal Australia, recognising that the highly infectious nature  of COVID-19 means that it will be present until a COVID-19 vaccine is found. The Framework  underscores the need for continued health vigilance while providing a path to easing the physical and  mental burden on Australians.

The Framework will establish an updated Common Operating Picture with strengthened criteria to  ensure that health systems are prepared and detailed information is publicly available on COVID-19  conditions. The criteria take into account the National Hotel Quarantine Review by Ms Jane Halton AO  PSM and will be informed by further work underway by Australia’s Chief Scientist Dr Alan Finkel AO on  digital contact tracing and public health systems, and advice from the Australian Health Protection  Principal Committee (AHPPC).

The Commonwealth and seven states and territories agreed to finalise the Framework by the next  National Cabinet meeting on 13 November 2020 and ensure that a new Common Operating Picture is  publicly available by 1 December 2020.

The Commonwealth and seven states and territories agreed that reopening by Christmas under the  Framework sets a pathway for the removal of domestic border restrictions where it is safe to do so, and  with free movement of people and freight consistent with National Cabinet’s strategy of suppression  with a goal of no community transmission.

Improving Quarantine Systems

Ms Jane Halton AO PSM presented the final report of the National Review of Hotel Quarantine  (document attached). National Cabinet thanked Ms Halton for the extensive work undertaken to review  the hotel quarantine system in seven of eight states and territories.

Ms Halton noted that quarantine constitutes a first line of defence in preventing the importation of  COVID-19 into Australia. While the quarantine system should be managed to limit breaches, the  robustness of a second line of defence (testing and contact tracing) is essential as it is not possible to  manage a quarantine system that is completely error free. There must also be a third line of defence -  physical distancing, hygiene and health system capacity.

National Cabinet agreed to publish the National Review of Hotel Quarantine and to  implement  recommendations, noting that the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory had already  established an emergency-surge quarantine capacity supported by the Northern Territory at Howard  Springs.

National Cabinet agreed to keep working on risk stratification as an appropriate approach to  progressively increasing the number of international arrivals to Australia in a COVID-safe manner,  including Australians returning home. Potential alternative approaches could include quarantine such  as  home quarantine, on farm quarantine, quarantine by universities and private providers, and use of  technology and expanding international travel arrangements with very low risk countries and cohorts.

As noted by Ms Halton and AHPPC, alternatives to hotel quarantine for low risk cohorts can also free up  significant capacity in Australia’s hotel quarantine system for returning Australians.

National Cabinet noted that any changes to quarantine settings for international arrivals must be done  in a way that maintains health considerations as an absolute priority.

Australians returning home

National Cabinet noted that there are a significant number of Australians wishing to return home from  overseas, with the Commonwealth already taken steps to further support those facing personal  hardship.

National Cabinet agreed that all jurisdictions would continue to work towards enabling more Australians  to return home.  Existing international air passenger arrival caps will continue until 21 November 2020,  with ongoing review by National Cabinet.

National Cabinet noted that a number of the states and territories will support the Commonwealth in  increasing the number of vulnerable Australians returning home.  This includes the Commonwealth-Northern Territory arrangement to provide 500 beds at Howard Springs, with the first flight dedicated to  vulnerable Australians arriving in Darwin today.

A further arrangement, soon to be finalised with the Australian Capital Territory, will support 150  returning Australians every 16-18 days.  In addition, a limited and dedicated number of spaces will be  provided on existing international commercial services for vulnerable Australians where possible. This  includes an additional:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 140 arrivals per week into Perth;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 100 arrivals every 14-16 days into Adelaide;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 150 arrivals per week into Queensland(to be finalised once a new Government is formally sworn  in).

Tasmania has also offered further support where required.

The Commonwealth thanks the states and territories for their support in helping more Australians  return home for Christmas.

Mental Health National Cabinet Reform Committee

National Cabinet noted 3,318 Australians died by suicide in 2019, equivalent to nine Australians each  and every day. This represents a significant loss to our communities, our families and our nation.

Today, National Cabinet commissioned the new Mental Health National Cabinet Reform Committee. The  Committee will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ deliver a new National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Agreement by November 2021;  and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ oversee, and provide advice to National Cabinet on, the implementation of the National Mental  Health and Wellbeing Pandemic Response Plan which guides jurisdictions’ responses to COVID-

19.

This work builds on all jurisdictions’ efforts to scale resources and investment to support Australians’  mental health and prevent suicide during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Aged Care Emergency Response Centres

National Cabinet again noted the critical importance of minimising the COVID-19 pandemic risk in aged  care, cementing preparedness arrangements based on the three previously agreed actions of 21 August.

The Department of Health continues weekly engagement with the Aged Care Quality and Safety  Commission and states and territories. Weekly jurisdictional reporting is now established.

All jurisdictions have provided assurances that their Aged Care Emergency Response Centres can be  stood up within 48 hours. Jurisdictions have completed the Response Centre Preparedness Assessment  which has provided additional clarity about where further focus is needed.

National Cabinet expressed its thanks to the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre which has supplied to  all jurisdictions—through the Department of Health—with its extensive suite of resources for use or  adaption as required.

The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission continues its program of infection control site visits to  residential aged care facilities in all jurisdictions to monitor and assess aged care preparedness. The  Commission is distributing summary reports of its spot check visits to each jurisdiction to enable  targeted focus on areas for improvement.

States and territories are supporting the Commission’s preparedness visits through sharing of public  health intelligence, conducting supplementary visits to residential aged care facilities and prioritising  face to face infection prevention and control training. Across jurisdictions a range of training models are  in place. States and territories continue to consider how best to tailor this training to their jurisdictional  requirements.

National Federation Reform Council

National Cabinet agreed to establish a Taskforce on Veterans’ Wellbeing in recognition of the challenges  faced by our current and ex-service personnel. The Taskforce will meet at the first meeting of the  National Federation Reform Council on 11 December.

On 26 June 2020, National Cabinet agreed that Mr Peter Conran AM would conduct a review of the  former COAG Councils and Ministerial Forums with a view to rationalising and resetting the structure  and work programs.

Today, National Cabinet accepted the Review's recommendations that include reducing the number of  ministerial forums and ensuring that those that remain are more agile and responsive, with direct  responsibility for decision-making resting with Ministers. Consistent with the direction set by National  Cabinet, ministers’ meetings will not report to National Cabinet (or the National Federation Reform  Council) unless tasked.

This represents a significant reform to Commonwealth-State relations and will significantly reduce  bureaucracy and red tape. National Cabinet also noted that the range of significant reforms agreed

today have come about directly through the collaboration of National Cabinet, as the country comes  together to continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Table of contents Open Australia

While restrictions put in place through 2020 have operated to slow the spread of  COVID-19. But the Australian community and industry have been heavily impacted by  these limitations.

The aim of this framework is to provide consideration and guidance for a reopening of  Australia whilst managing the health impacts and severity of COVID-19.

It is acknowledged that states and territories have the decision making authority in  relation to public health measures. The national strategy is suppression with a goal of  no community transmission.

Objective | Build on the ‘3-Step Framework for a COVIDSafe Australia’, to nationally reopen to a state of  ‘COVID Normal’, wherever it is safe to do so, by December 2020

“Quarantine constitutes a first line of defence in preventing the  importation of COVID-19. While the quarantine system should be  managed to limit breaches, the robustness of elements of the  second line of defence (testing, contact tracing in the community)  are also crucial as it will not be possible to manage a quarantine  system that is completely error free. And must be backed by a  third line of defence - physical distancing, hygiene and health  system capacity.”

- National Review of Hotel Quarantine, 2020

PROTECTING THE WELLBEING, HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL AUSTRALIANS.

KEY PRINCIPLES

Measures that are proportionate | Use of COVIDSafe plans, effective testing and contact tracing, strong  guidance to individuals around their responsibilities, and targeted restrictions, including around  gatherings and activities. Response measures and decisions are proportionate to the risk of harm and  transmission, with a commitment to a nimble, targeted and localised response as informed by clear  health advice, data and modelling.

Consistent approach | Commit to a national approach between state and territory jurisdictions to the  opening up of the economy and removing border restrictions, while continuing to implement the agreed  COVID-19 suppression strategy, towards the goal of no community transmission.

Protect national wellbeing | Decision making accounts for minimising displacement of workers and  long-term damage to career paths, and considers the long term effects on mental health and wellbeing  due to unemployment, social isolation and the protracted pandemic.

Well communicated | Community expectations are managed through clear communication of risk,  balanced with messages to increase public confidence where risk is low. Ensure the public (with attention  to culturally and linguistically diverse communities) and business understands and complies with the rules  through consistent and timely messaging, targeted government support and appropriate enforcement.

Support confidence to allow economic activity to continue and/or restart | Support economic activity  through community and consumer confidence. Ensure businesses understand their obligations to  manage the health and safety risks that their operations present, and build business confidence and  adaptive capacity through the recovery.

States and territories  have the decision  making authority in  relation to public

health measures.

The national strategy  is suppression with a  goal of no community  transmission.

Framework for National Reopening | Summary and Analysis PAGE 3

Outbreaks are managed  through a swift public health  response, in line with advice  from the Australian Health  Protection Principal Committee

Removal of domestic border  restrictions to facilitate free  movement of people and  freight consistent with the

virus suppression strategy  and local health advice.

Physical distancing (1.5m),  maintaining good hand  hygiene, staying home if  unwell and getting tested

for COVID-19 if  symptomatic

PILLARS TO SUPPORT A COVID NORMAL AUSTRALIA

All businesses have a  COVIDSafe Plan in  place

BEST PRACTICE HEALTH COMPONENTS FOR AN UPDATED COMMON OPERATING PICTURE BY END OF  NOVEMBER 2020 (See Appendix A for example COP)

COVID Normal Australia Plan | Summary and Analysis PAGE 4

1. Surveillance A streamlined system of daily reporting of cases and clusters *  Robust epidemiological data around cases and clusters *   Routine wastewater testing to identify undetected disease in a mix of regional and metropolitan areas * Data for the Common Operating Picture (COP) and revision of metrics to inform the response * AHPPC monthly review of innovative and novel testing platforms, including international experience and published literature  to enable setting-appropriate detection of disease

2. Quarantine and isolation

Best practice quarantine and isolation practices in line with the findings of the Halton review Daily epidemiological data about individuals and disease detected in quarantine *

3. Testing and contact tracing

Continue communication strategies to encourage testing uptake to detect disease in people with acute respiratory illness * Enable a surge laboratory capacity of 3 tests per 1000 population per day Measure test turnaround times and respond as suitable to delays of over 2 days Detect all chains of transmission by contact tracing down stream and upstream contacts with all close contacts notified within 2  days*

4. Outbreak responsiveness

Rapid deployment of skilled outbreak management teams * Plans to scale up the response * Support detection of disease outside of the immediate response zone e.g. local government areas or local health networks Ensure an embedded Aged Care Response Centre in each jurisdiction

* Note: Halton and Finkel reviews are subject to separate National Cabinet considerations.

There is an ongoing and potentially increased risk of introduction of COVID-19 from overseas. In addition to strong quarantine and isolation,  we need ongoing cooperation of the public to undertake activities in a COVIDSafe manner and to continue to present for testing. Australia’s  response and continued work is based on the science and evidence around transmission of the disease. To be COVIDSafe requires  continuous evaluation of the effectiveness and implementation of the plans. Measures to identify and manage localised outbreaks should be  driven by public health advice, with a focus on vulnerable populations such as indigenous communities, aged care and people with a  disability.

The following provides a snap shot of the sectors that have been severely impacted by the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions., including border restrictions, limits on  business and social distancing measures.  While COVID-19 continues to have significant impacts on Australian businesses, these impacts continue to evolve in response to  changes in restrictions and policy announcements including the Federal Budget. This does not form part of the framework and is for context only.  Industry impacts vary across jurisdictions.

It is estimated 30 per cent of the tourism sector will not  survive, and one third of the tourism workforce may become  unemployed.

NATIONAL IMPACTS OF COVID RESTRICTIONS ON AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY - as at 30 September 2020

Framework for National Reopening | Summary and Analysis PAGE 5

Aviation at major airports is down more than  95 per cent on pre-COVID levels

Sectors CRITICALLY AT RISK from COVID-19 restrictions.

Non-food sales in Victoria up to 65 per cent lower  than a year ago. Melbourne’s main retail location  vacancy rates are 50 per cent higher than two  years ago.

126,000 arts, sports and entertainment services  workers are expected to lose their jobs.

Many small businesses operating on extremely  slim cash reserves, with funds for three months  or less.

The COVID-19 pandemic could cut demand for  housing in Australia by between 129,000 and 232,000 dwellings over the next three years.

Sectors AT RISK from COVID-19 restrictions.

Independent food and beverage retailers expected  to reduce service levels by up to 65.4 per cent.

The manufacturing sector continues to be dependent  on recovery in other sectors, particularly construction.  Demand is expected to be down 15 per cent nationally.

Hospitality industry expects 30 per cent of  businesses will close permanently this year.

Australia’s universities are forecast to have  significant impact to revenue due to the fall in  international student tuition fees and other income.

The number of tourism industry jobs fell by 109,000  over the year to 611,700 in the June quarter. This is  the lowest number of tourism jobs since 2014.

Sticking to National Cabinet’s Three Step framework, managing health risks effectively and supporting the economy Ã¢ÂÂ¢ National Cabinet’s May 2020 3 Step Framework for a COVIDSafe Australia was based on public health advice and intended to mitigate the significant risk of COVID-19  and has informed this framework.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ There are widespread concerns from industry that inconsistencies between state/territory approaches to reopening continue to destabilise businesses and consumers. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ These sectors are crucial enablers and have economic links with other activities - restrictions impacting them will hit the supply chain downstream and upstream.

Workplaces must meet the relevant COVIDSafe planning and implementation obligations of state and territory jurisdictions. Each  jurisdiction has published approaches on their respective websites for either a COVIDSafe Plan or COVID Safety Plan, noting  these are functionally the same.

Generally, COVIDSafe Plans set out how workplaces are prepared to protect staff and customers to prevent infection, respond to a  COVID-19 case and business recovery. Plans should address the advice of Safe Work Australia regarding identifying and  controlling infection hazards, assessing and controlling risks, and case-notification steps. Work health and safety requirements depend on workplace circumstances and state and territory regulations, but should address:

COVIDSafe PLAN IN PLACE

Framework for National Reopening | Summary and Analysis PAGE 6

Safety practices can mitigate the need for restrictions where local conditions allow Where risks can be managed through health and safety practises (COVIDSafe Plans), costlier action is needed less.

If state and territory health authorities judge COVIDSafe Plans not enough for certain activities, tailored ‘High Risk COVIDSafe Plan’ requirements could impose stricter standards while still allowing safe businesses open their doors.

Strong testing and contact tracing systems and outbreak management, increase our capacity to identify and handle cases of  community transmission.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ a specific COVID-19 risk assessment and implementation of measures to manage identified risks

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ information on requirements for physical distancing and measures to ensure appropriate distancing

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ guidance on how workers and others can maintain good hygiene in the workplace

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ guidance on cleaning and disinfecting the workplace to protect workers and others from the risk of   exposure to COVID-19.

Industry-specific guidance that may assist with determining the risks of COVID-19 is available from Safe Work Australia. Each  jurisdiction provides information on their website by industry.

INDUSTRY PREPARDENESS, RESTRICTIONS AND RISK MITIGATION ACTIVITIES FOR BUSINESS

Framework for National Reopening | Summary and Analysis PAGE 7

Freight protocol

Activities and venues identified in the AHPPC statement on very high  risk environments may continue to be restricted including: Ã¢ÂÂ¢ night clubs Ã¢ÂÂ¢ dance venues and events

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ large unstructured outdoor events, such as:  - music festivals - food festivals - schoolies graduation festivals - carnivals - some community sporting events - other unticketed spectator events Please refer to Page 10 for further information.

Businesses operating under a COVIDSafe plan should be unrestricted outside standard capacity or density caps. Activities are limited/restricted  based on highest-risk and lowest economic impact, with input from  evidence-based health advice and industry consultation.

Community and industry communications strategies should be  developed that considers consistency with previous public  messaging and includes the below considerations regarding ongoing  business activity.

A staged reopening can expand the role of safety practices  over time. Industry will be critical to self regulating and  enforcing their COVIDSafe plans in order to operate.

This risk-based framework is a consistent approach that can adapt  to changing circumstances and tolerance for risk. As we move  through the steps, COVIDSafe plans and risk assessments can  become the benchmark for activities that were previously specifically  restricted. Equally, should outbreaks emerge, tailored plans or  restrictions may be needed for higher-risk activities in these places.

Certain activities will continue to require targeted requirements  beyond COVIDSafe plans during this reopening phase based on  assessed risk.

All jurisdictions have requirements for either a COVIDSafe Plan or  a COVID Safety Plan for businesses. Requirements vary by  jurisdiction including specific industry plans, digital registrations,  templates, fact sheets or flexible to pre-defined criteria and COVID  Marshals. A high level summary is provided below. The role of  industry in supporting the national strategy is critical.

COVIDSafe Plans

The information below summarises each jurisdiction’s approach. There are no metrics on the  number of plans created/endorsed by each state/territory.

Victoria | From 13 September 2020, it is mandatory for every Victorian business to have a  COVID Safe Plan. High Risk industries must create a ‘HIGH RISK COVIDSafe plan’. Link

NSW | The NSW government provides sector based guidance, including checklists, for  COVID Safety Plans for business. Link

QLD | The QLD government provides approved sector based COVIDSafe Industry Plans  including checklists and roadmap. Link Roadmap

ACT | The ACT government provides guidance for COVID Safety Plans for business. The  ACT does not require the use of a standard template when developing their COVID Safety  Plan. Link

SA | The SA government provides guidance and online submissions. Link

NT | The NT government provides guidance for COVID Safety Plans for business including  checklists. Link

WA | The WA government provides guidance including sector specific information. Link

TAS | The TAS  government provides guidance for COVID Safety Plans for business  including checklists. Link

COVID Industry preparedness by jurisdiction

The Freight Movement Protocol and Code should continue to apply when border controls are in place. Changes to border control measures will influence the application of the  enforceable measures contained in the Freight Protocol and Code.

State and territory jurisdictions are responsible for enforcement of the measures included in the Code and are likely to reduce or remove measures when border controls are  removed. While variation to the Freight Movement Protocol and Code is likely, there is an enduring role in ensuring national consistency for freight when releasing restrictions.

Work Work from home if and where it suits you and your employer.

Gatherings  Occupancy of venues and gatherings are limited to one person per two or four square metres (as determined by the  jurisdiction).

Travel

Removal of domestic borders - Free movement between areas with no community transmission of COVID-19 should  be permitted. Initial international student and seasonal worker pilots underway.

Work Return to your workplace (unless otherwise advised by public health advice).

Gatherings  People should maintain social distancing of 1.5 metres and stay at home if unwell and get tested. Some density limits will remain for  events and large venues.

Travel

Interstate travel is open and there are no domestic border restrictions in place. International travel partnerships and pilot programs in  place. Quarantine free international travel between New Zealand and other low risk international partners.

PROPOSED STEPS AND TIMINGS - SUMMARY

Framework for National Reopening | Summary and Analysis PAGE 8

Regional responses that are more restrictive may apply for localised outbreaks. This framework is intended to apply only to areas that are not being treated under other  conditions in response to an outbreak requiring health intervention. Health imposed restrictions will supersede any step in this framework for the defined region.

STEP 1: Limiting group interactions and movement New locally acquired cases indicator on the Common Operating Picture is green for 14 days AND <3 cases in either high transmission  settings or hard to reach populations.

STEP 2: Larger gatherings, more movement New locally acquired cases indicator on the Common Operating Picture is green for 14 days AND no cases in either high transmission settings or hard to  reach populations

STEP 3:  COVID NORMAL All indicators on the Common Operating Picture are green for 14 days

Step aligns with the Third Step within  the Victorian Coronavirus (COVID-19  roadmap to reopening. It will currently  only apply to Victoria as other  jurisdictions have already progressed  beyond this step. Including another  step between Step 1 and 2 in this  framework is at the discretion of the  jurisdiction’s local health advice.

All steps are subject to change based on expert health advice. States and territories can implement changes based on their COVID-19 conditions, however steps should  be sequential.

Jurisdictions who  are beyond the  restrictions outlined  in Step 2 and have  no COVID-19  cases are not  expected to step  back into further  restrictions as a  result of this  framework.

Work Work from home if able.

Gatherings  Occupancy of venues, indoor and outdoor gatherings, and events are capacity limited to specific  numbers.

Travel Free movement between areas with no community transmission of COVID-19 should be permitted.

All operating businesses must have a COVIDSafe Plan | Physical distancing at 1.5 metres | Stay at home if unwell | Effective testing and contact tracing |  Frequent cleaning and disinfection | COVIDSafe Plan auditing

PROPOSED NEW 3 STEP PLAN TO SUSTAIN A COVID NORMAL AUSTRALIA

HIGH LEVEL TIMELINE & ADVICE ON NEXT STEPS

Framework for National Reopening | Summary and Analysis PAGE 10

Ongoing COVID identification and management

COVID Testing, monitoring and reporting | information on ongoing  clinical testing and clinics is available through jurisdictional websites  and the Department of Health. Ongoing reporting and epidemiology  form part of a suite of data to inform the national strategy.

Wastewater testing for COVID-19 | various jurisdictions are  undertaking wastewater testing, analysis and monitoring as part of a  surveillance strategy, particularly for outbreaks and an early warning tool  to alert communities to infections.

Genome sequencing and tracing | leading research institutes are  undertaking genome sequencing to track COVID-19 including viral mutations  and provide early warning signals of emerging strains and detection. Australia’s

Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) has provided a $3.3 million grant  through UNSW Sydney’s School of Medical Sciences to establish the network.

COVID-19 vaccine development and testing | the Department of Health lead  the COVID-19 Vaccine and Treatment Strategy which supports access to, and  delivery of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, as soon as  they are available.

National Review of Hotel Quarantine

The findings from the National Review of Hotel Quarantine,  led by Jane Halton AO, will be considered at National  Cabinet in parallel with this framework.

All jurisdictions should consider the recommendations of the  review and implement them as part of their reopening  process.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ >100 cases per day  nationally Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Rate >0.4/100,000  population per week

calculated into  number for each state

Managing a very small number of new  COVID-19 infections is possible, however as  numbers increase, intervention is required  to ensure new cases do not outstrip testing,  tracing and health system capacity. Any new locally acquired or under  investigation case is concerning

0.06/100,000  population per week  calculated into  number for each state

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Rate >-0.06/100,000  population per week  calculated into  number for each state

Seeding of cases is more likely with a higher  rate of importation. The rate is lower than  above because arrivals are in supervised  quarantine.

Regional and remote cases in the past 7 days  compared to the week  prior (Based on ABS area  classification mechanism.  Includes very remote,  remote, and outer  regional postcodes)

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ <0.04/100,000  population per week (Represents <10 cases nationally)

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 0.04-0.06/100,000  population per week (Represents <10 cases nationally)

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ >=0.06/100,000  population per week (Represents >=10  cases nationally)

Threat of outbreak - outbreak is extending  and covering a greater geographical area.

Health system capacity - regional  communities have a large proportion of  elderly and vulnerable people and less  health care resources.

Reff - Effective  reproductive number - where there are more  than  20 cases in the past  7 days

<20% probability that Reff  is >1 20% - 49% probability that  Reff is > 1

50% probability that Reff is >1 In areas with active cases, an Reff greater  than one indicates unlikely to

control/decrease new case numbers. This  means the outbreak is expected to continue  to grow.

Traffic light classification for testing

Metric Green Amber Red Rationale

Tests (sum) in the past 7  days  compared to the week  prior

Modelling is underway to determine optimal testing rates for populations with community transmission and populations  with no community transmission. Declines in testing rates (*), especially where there is no community transmission, should be interpreted with caution.  Testing recommendations currently advise and prioritise testing of anyone with acute respiratory illness (ARI) symptoms; if  community rates of ARI are low this will affect the number of people presenting for testing.  % positive in the past 7  days

compared to the week  prior

% positive below 0.25%. % positive 0.25% to 0.5% % positive >0.5% Assuming testing rates remain high and  well distributed, amber or red indicate  that the incidence of COVID-19 in the  community is increasing and intervention  could be required.

Mean tests per 1,000  population per day in  the past 7 days

Modelling is underway to determine optimal testing rates for populations with community transmission and populations  with no community transmission.

Traffic light classification for cases  in aged care facilities

Metric Green Amber Red Rationale

Number of cases reported in  residents in RACF in the past  7 days  compared to the week prior

No facilities with resident  cases The number of cases in  residents is not zero.

Compared to the week prior,  case numbers have: - increased by less than  or equal to ten; or

- decreased by greater  than or equal to ten.

Compared to the week prior,  the number of cases in  residents has: - increased by greater

than ten; or - decreased by less than  ten

Residents within aged care facilities are  particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Any  number of facilities with active resident cases  should require concern (amber).

Number of cases reported in  staff in RACF in the past 7  days compared to the week  prior

No facilities with staff cases The number of cases in staff  is not zero.  Compared to the week prior,  case numbers have: - increased by less than

or equal to ten; or  - decreased by greater  than or equal to ten.

Compared to the week prior,  the number of cases in staff has: - increased by greater

than ten; or - decreased by less than  ten

Aged care staff are in close contact with many  aged care residents. An infectious staff member  has the potential to transmit COVID-19 to a  large number of vulnerable residents (who in  turn have a higher mortality rate).

Traffic light classification for capacity Metric Green Amber Red Rationale

Number and proportion of  outstanding case  notifications (>24 hours  since health department  notified of positive result)

Zero Proportion: >0-5% Proportion: >5% Rapid contact of cases enables disease control

by early isolation and quarantine

Number and proportion of  outstanding case interviews  (>24 hours since health  department notified of a  positive result)

Zero Proportion: >0-5% Proportion: >5% Rapid contact of cases enables disease control

by early isolation and quarantine

Number and proportion of  known contacts awaiting  notification (>48 hours since  health department notified  of a positive result)

Zero Proportion: >0-5% Proportion: >5% Rapid contact of contacts enables disease

control by early quarantine

Public Health Workforce  Status including own surge  capacity

Within capacity Under strain Saturated Qualitative measure for this encompasses many

aspects of the response, each of which can be a  critical point

Timeliness of test  notification for positive  results

>90 % reported within 2 days 75-90% reported within 2 days <75% reported within 2 days This is the turn around time from the time the  test is taken, transported to a suitable

laboratory, test conducted and results reported  to the health department. Results within 2 days  enables early identification of contacts from  cases, and ensures that cases are in isolation.

ICU due to COVID-19 (pre-surge) <15%  of available ICU beds  are COVID patients

15 - 29% of available ICU beds are COVID patients > 30% ICU beds are COVID patients

>30% ICU beds go to surge

An indicator of when surge capacity is going to  be needed to support patients with COVID-19 in  ICU.

Data sources and additional resources The Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) have informed the traffic light thresholds in the  operating picture. Data are sourced from:

- the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS);  - the Critical Health Resource Information System;  - aged care facility report;

- modelling; and

- daily reports from state and territory health departments.

Most metrics use a rate or proportion rather than a raw number, to account for variability between state and territory populations.

Due to the dynamic nature of jurisdictional daily reports and thus NNDSS data, data in this report are subject to retrospective revision and may vary from data reported in  published NNDSS reports and reports of notification data by states and territories.
