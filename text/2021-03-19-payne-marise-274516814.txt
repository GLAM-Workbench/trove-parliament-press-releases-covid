MEDIA RELEASE

AMBASSADOR TO NEPAL

Today I announce the appointment of Ms Felicity Volk as Australia’s next Ambassador to Nepal.

Australia and Nepal celebrated 60 years of diplomatic relations in 2020, though Australia's close  relationship with Nepal predates the establishment of diplomatic links in 1960.

This relationship is built on shared interests in regional stability, security and prosperity, and is  underpinned by an active Nepali community in Australia. Each year many Nepali students come  to Australia to study, develop skills and experience to support Nepal’s economy, while many  Australian tourists travel to Nepal.

Amid the challenges associated with COVID-19 in 2020, Nepal supported the Australian  Government’s efforts to bring home over 1,400 Australians, including on Nepal’s national carrier  Nepal Airlines. This was made possible by close and valued cooperation with the Nepal  Government. Building on a long history of development cooperation, we will continue to support  Nepal’s response to COVID-19 and longer-term recovery.

Ms Volk is a career officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and was most  recently Director, New Colombo Plan Secretariat. She has previously served overseas in  Vientiane and Dhaka.

Ms Volk holds a Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Laws (Honours) from the University of  Queensland.

I thank outgoing Ambassador Peter Budd for his contributions to advancing Australia’s interests  in Nepal since 2017.
