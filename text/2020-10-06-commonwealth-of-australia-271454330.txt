Delivering a world class  health system The Government is committing record funding  to health, with total spending of $93.8 billion in  2020-21, an increase of almost 43 per cent since  2014-15. This will ensure Australians can continue  to access the essential GP, pharmaceutical and  hospital services they rely on.

Ensuring quality care for  vulnerable people The Government is progressing reforms to  deliver enhanced access, quality and safety  in aged care.

The Government  is providing record  investment in essential  services including health and

education, reforming super  and making Australia   more resilient  —

Reforms to make your super   work harder for you The Government is continuing to progress  reforms to ensure members’ money  is maximised for their retirement. The  Government’s Your Future, Your Super reforms   will see members save $17.9 billion over 10 years.  The Government wants members to choose the  best super fund for them and these reforms  will make the system simpler and easier to  engage with. This will help improve competition  and drive fees down from the $30 billion that  Australians currently pay each year.

The reforms will remove the flaws in the system  that have created unwanted multiple accounts.  They will also make it clear to a member when  their fund is underperforming. Importantly,  these changes will make super trustees more  accountable and provide more transparency on  how they are spending members’ money.

A more secure and   resilient Australia  Australians have been through challenging  times with the 2019-20 bushfires and the  COVID-19 pandemic. As part of a more resilient  Australia the Government has established a  Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster  Arrangements, and a $2 billion National Bushfire  Recovery Fund.

The Government is keeping Australians safe  through the 2020 Cyber Security Strategy and  providing additional funding of $300 million  for the Australian Federal Police to continue to  protect Australians.

Lowering energy prices To keep electricity affordable the Government  will work with the states, through a program  worth up to $250 million, to accelerate three  important electricity transmission projects. It will  also provide $52.9 million to support a gas-fired  recovery, including by investing $28.3 million in  five Strategic Basin Plans to unlock Australia’s  vast gas reserves.

Record funding   for a world class   health system Investing in hospitals and   affordable medicines

The Government is committing record ongoing  funding to health, with total spending of   $93.8 billion in 2020-21, an increase of almost  43 per cent since 2014-15. This will ensure  Australians can continue to access essential  medical, pharmaceutical and hospital services.

Supporting our public  hospitals All states and territories have signed the   2020-25 National Health Reform Agreement.  Under the Agreement, the Government has

invested $134 billion in funding for Australia’s  public hospitals, an increase of 30 per cent over  the previous five years.

This agreement supports the delivery of  innovative high cost therapies in public hospitals,  with funding shared equally between the  Commonwealth and states and territories.  Through these arrangements, patients will be  able to access advanced treatments in Australia’s  public hospitals, such as CAR-T cell therapy for  some rare types of cancer.

Supporting  health   innovation  —

Investing in world class medical research  and health system innovation

Investing in medical research The Medical Research Future Fund has   reached its target balance of $20 billion.   The Government’s 10-year investment   plan is continuing to support lifesaving   and job-creating medical research.

The Government is investing $47 million  over four years to accelerate research into  diabetes and cardiovascular disease, conditions  affecting millions of Australians.

The Government is also contributing $50 million  to the establishment of the Victorian Melanoma  and Clinical Trials Centre at the Alfred Hospital,  helping researchers to better understand  melanoma.

Simpler private   health insurance The Government is providing $19.5 million to  improve access to and affordability of private  health insurance. The Government is increasing  the maximum age of dependants allowed under  private health insurance policies from 24 to   31 years and removing the age limit for  dependants with disability.

The Government is also enhancing the Medical  Costs Finder website, increasing transparency of  out-of-pocket costs and assisting consumers to  choose a specialist.

Support for Australia’s  thalidomide survivors  Thalidomide survivors and their families will  receive financial support from the Government  for a range of health and disability services and  equipment, as well as a lump sum payment  and annual payments to assist with daily living  expenses. These payments will be tax-free and  not impact on other benefit or welfare payments.

Innovative models of   primary care  The Government is also trialling innovative  models of primary care, providing $3.3 million  to support multidisciplinary approaches to  health care at five trial sites across western and  southern New South Wales.

The Government is also providing $50.3 million  to invest in the rural health workforce through  increasing training and infrastructure for the  Rural Health Multidisciplinary Training program.

Guaranteeing the Essential Services   |   Budget 2020-21  9

Supporting quality   aged care  Investing in quality care   for senior Australians

Additional home care support To support senior Australians who wish to stay  at home for longer the Government is providing  $1.6 billion for an additional 23,000 home care  packages. This means the number of home care  packages will have increased threefold from  around 60,300 in 2013 to around 185,500 in 2021.

Delivering quality   residential care  A further $11.3 million will be provided for  additional training and support for aged care  providers and carers of people experiencing  behavioural and psychological symptoms of  dementia.

The Government will improve oversight and  investigation of serious incidents of misconduct  through the Serious Incident Response Scheme,  with additional funding of $29.8 million.

The Government is providing $10.6 million to  connect younger people living in residential aged  care to age appropriate accommodation.

This will support the Government’s target   to have no people under the age of 65   living in residential aged care by 2025.   From March 2019 to June 2020, there has   been a 39 per cent reduction in the number   of people under the age of 65 entering  residential aged care.

The Government is continuing to develop  an alternative aged care funding tool—the  Australian National Aged Care Classification  (AN-ACC). This Budget includes $91.6 million  in funding for a new independent AN-ACC  assessment workforce.

Completing the geographic  rollout of the NDIS On 1 July 2020, the Government completed  the geographic rollout of the NDIS with the  scheme becoming available on Christmas and  Cocos Islands. This means individuals living  with disability and their families from across  all regions of Australia have access to these  essential supports.

Over 400,000 people with permanent and  significant disability now benefit from the   NDIS, with many receiving disability supports   for the first time.

Guaranteeing the Essential Services   |   Budget 2020-21  11

Improving services  The Government is delivering on its  commitment to implement a Participant  Service Guarantee and setting clear  standards and timeframes for decision  making by the National Disability Insurance  Agency (NDIA).

This will make it easier for people with   disability and their families to navigate   the NDIS. The Government is providing an  additional $799 million over four years to

the NDIA and the NDIS Quality and  Safeguards Commission to ensure  participants receive quality supports   as quickly as possible.

The Government is also providing   ongoing support for the Royal   Commission into Violence, Abuse,   Neglect and Exploitation of People   with Disability, due to report in 2022.

Helping children   get the best start   to their education

Quality preschool education The Government is continuing to fund  preschools so children get the best   start to their education. The Government   will invest $453 million to extend the National  Partnership Agreement on Universal Access to  Early Childhood Education until the end of 2021.  This will help ensure that every child has access  to a quality preschool education for 15 hours a  week in the year before school.

Supporting families to   return to work Child care services are vital for so many parents  and their children. In 2020-21, the Government  will pay approximately $9 billion in Child Care  Subsidy payments. Due to the means-tested  nature of the subsidy, families who have lost  income or work during the COVID-19 pandemic  and continue to use care will receive a higher  level of subsidy.

In addition, the Government is extending the  easing of the Activity Test requirements for all  Australian families through to 4 April 2021 so that  they can continue to receive the same level of  subsidised care as before the pandemic.

Investing in   our future skills  Ensuring all Australians have  the skills they need to get a job

More job-ready graduates  To power our post COVID-19 economic recovery,   the Government is supporting both school  leavers and displaced workers to build career  pathways and develop skills which meet the  needs of prospective employers.

To do this, the Government is investing   $299 million to provide an additional 12,000  undergraduate Commonwealth Supported  Places in 2021. These will be prioritised according  to labour market need, skills gaps and industry  engagement.

This is on top of the additional 100,000  undergraduate places by 2030 announced  through the Job-ready Graduates Package,  including around 17,000 additional places in 2021.  This will support school leavers and job seekers  through the COVID-19 pandemic and help drive  the nation’s economic recovery.

Helping Australians to   reskill and upskill The economic disruption of the COVID-19  pandemic is expected to encourage more people  to take up tertiary study. To ensure the sector  has capacity to meet this increased demand,  the Government is committing $252 million to  support the delivery of 50,000 higher education  short courses. Short online courses including in

teaching, health, science, information technology  and agriculture will provide faster training  pathways and alternative study options for  workers looking to upskill.

In addition, the $1 billion JobTrainer Fund   will provide up to 340,700 additional free or   low-fee training places. The Fund will support  job seekers, school leavers and young people  to remain engaged and have the opportunity to  acquire skills that will help them get a job.

These investments will provide opportunities for  students and the recently unemployed to retrain  in areas of high demand and national priority.

Providing certainty   for students The Government guaranteed $18 billion in  funding for all higher education institutions in  2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.   The Government is also guaranteeing funding  to higher education providers from 2021 to 2023  as they transition to new funding arrangements  as part of the Job-ready Graduate reforms  to support universities and higher education  providers to continue to deliver quality teaching.

Your Future,  Your Super Australians pay $30 billion a year in super fees —Reforms to make your super work harder for youAustralia’s compulsory superannuation system  is essential to the retirement incomes of its  16 million members. The industry manages  $3 trillion in hard-working Australians’ retirement savings. Fundamental flaws in the system have meant many Australians have  been let down.International comparisons show that Australian super fees are among the highest in the world. Australians pay $30 billion a year in super fees, which is more than the $27 billion a year they spend on energy bills.The Government is committed to securing a better superannuation system for all Australians with reforms that make Australians’ super work harder for them to maximise their retirement savings. The Government’s Your Future, Your Super Package is the next step in the Government’s continued efforts to deliver on this goal. The reforms will make the superannuation system better for members in four ways. Benefits of Your Future,

For the first time, Australians will automatically  keep their superannuation fund when they  change employers. ‘Stapling’ the super account  to the employee will ensure their super follows  them when they change jobs.

Guaranteeing the Essential Services   |   Budget 2020-21  19

This measure will stop the creation of unintended  multiple accounts and boost workers’ super  balances by around $280 million every year.

Empowering members The Government wants members to  engage with their superannuation  and actively decide which fund is  best suited to their needs. That is  why the Government is making  it simpler for Australians to  choose a good super fund. This  will result in more competition,  which will drive down fees and  increase retirement savings.

For those looking to select their  own super fund, the new online  YourSuper comparison tool  will help them compare the  performance of MySuper  products and make a better  decision.

Holding funds  to account for  underperformance The Government is protecting members  from superannuation funds that deliver poor  outcomes. Funds will be required to inform their  members when they underperform and give  them the option to move their money to a better  performing fund.

Funds that continue to underperform will no  longer be allowed to receive new members.

Increasing transparency   and accountability Given that super trustees are managing  Australians’ money, it is critical that they are  accountable and transparent in how they  manage that money. The Government will

ensure that superannuation funds only spend  members’ retirement savings on activities that  are in their best financial interests to maximise  their retirement savings. The Government is also  ensuring that super funds are more transparent  by requiring them to disclose key information to  members ahead of Annual Members’ Meetings.

Benefits to Australians The Your Future, Your Super reforms will see  Australians save $17.9 billion over 10 years in  reduced fees and better performance of the  superannuation system.

Delivering the  2020 Cyber   Security Strategy    —

Keeping  Australians  safe Enhancing cyber security and building  a stronger defence industry

Securing the online  environment  Australia’s cyber security capabilities are strong,  but the threats we face online are increasing.

The Government will provide an additional  $202 million to deliver the 2020 Cyber Security  Strategy, creating a more secure online world for  all Australians.

This takes the Government’s total funding for the  Strategy to $1.7 billion to provide a cyber security  uplift that is fit for purpose in the evolving online  environment.

The Strategy is needed to protect Australians,  their businesses, and the essential services upon  which we depend.

It is estimated that a significant cyber attack  impacting Australia for four weeks could cost  the economy as much as $30 billion and an  estimated 163,000 jobs. As part of the 2020  Strategy, the Government is investing   $128 million to counter cyber criminals.

$2 billion   for new projects   under the   National Water

Infrastructure   Development Fund     —

Securing Australia’s water The Government is building water infrastructure  for the 21st Century, helping to increase our  water security, build regional resilience, deliver  jobs and grow our critical agriculture sector.  The National Water Grid will help secure reliable  supplies of water for rural and regional Australia  now and into the future. An investment of   $2 billion for new projects under the National  Water Infrastructure Development Fund  will support the next generation of water  infrastructure through the Grid. This more than  doubles the fund to a total of $3.5 billion.

The Government is also investing $270 million to  improve the Murray Darling Basin’s river health,  to support its local communities, and to improve  sustainable water management.

Strengthening BOM  forecasting capability The Bureau of Meteorology’s weather  observation network ranks among the most  extensive and highly regarded in the world.  In this Budget, the Government is investing  over $250 million to lock in the benefits of the  Bureau’s around-the-clock, trusted forecasts   and warnings to keep Australians safe and  prepared during severe weather events.

Lower energy  prices  Expanding supply to ensure  affordable and reliable energy



Household  electricity prices  have fallen by   4.7 per cent

since December  2018    —

Nationally, household electricity prices have  fallen by 4.7 per cent since December 2018, with  wholesale electricity prices decreasing over the  past 12 months. Lower prices have been driven  by lower supply costs and the Government’s  Default Market Offer. The Government is locking   in these gains to ensure affordable power.

Critical transmission projects  Partnering with the states, the Government  is accelerating three important electricity  transmission projects—the Marinus Link, Project  Energy Connect and VNI West interconnectors.  These projects will increase electricity supply and  reduce prices.

Gas-fired recovery The Government will provide $52.9 million to  support a gas-fired recovery. To help unlock  Australia’s vast gas reserves, the Government  will develop five Strategic Basin Plans. This will  be complemented by the first National Gas  Infrastructure Plan, which will identify priority  projects, ensuring gas is delivered where it is  needed.

New generation To ensure affordable electricity in New South  Wales, the Government is setting the private  sector a 1,000 MW target for committed new  dispatchable generation projects by April 2021.  The Government will take action to replace  Liddell’s capacity if this target is not met.

Microgrids in regional and   remote communities The Government will provide $67.1 million in  grants to support new microgrids in regional   and remote communities to deliver affordable  and reliable power.
