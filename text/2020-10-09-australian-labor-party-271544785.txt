EXPERTS SLAM HEALTH BUDGET

Health experts have savaged the 2020 Budget for ignoring Australia’s longstanding health  challenges.

Labor welcomes a number of sensible measures, including to continue the COVID-19  health response, extend Medicare mental health consultations, and provide long-overdue  support for Australia’s thalidomide survivors.

Labor has been urging the Government to adopt these policies for months, and will now  work to ensure their implementation - including consulting thalidomide survivors on the  adequacy of proposed supports.

However, health experts say the Budget is more notable for what it ignores than what it  includes.

Experts have slammed Scott Morrison and Greg Hunt for their inaction on:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Long-term policy and funding   “The Budget has left most other challenges in health care for another day. More is needed  on preventive health. More is needed on long term public hospital funding. Private health is  facing viability issues, and General Practice in particular needs help now”.  Dr Omar Khorshid, President, Australian Medical Association

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Mental health reform  “Serious mental health reform, and related equity issues, have once again been left in the  waiting room”  Professor Ian Hickie, Brain and Mind Centre

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Public health   “[The Budget] is a huge disappointment, bordering on disastrous; especially in a year when  keeping Australians healthy has been the top priority of all governments.”  Public Health Association of Australia

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Pandemic preparedness  “An Australian Centre for Disease Control could have positioned Australia to better deal  with future pandemic challenges”  Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association

Tragic inequalities for First Nations peoples and regional and rural Australia, as well as  record costs and waits for care, were also ignored.

Labor will scrutinise a number of other measures, including a proposed agreement with



pharmaceutical companies that includes new PBS savings.

The Government’s record of cuts and neglect had exacerbated Australia’s health  challenges long before COVID-19.

Judging by the inaction in last night’s Budget, they’ll be with us long after.
