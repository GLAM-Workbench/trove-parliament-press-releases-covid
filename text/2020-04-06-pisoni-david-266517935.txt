More bushfire relief for small businesses in South Australia

Small businesses in an additional six Local Government Areas (LGAs) in South Australia can  now access grants worth $10,000 to assist with bushfire recovery.

The Australian and South Australian Governments today announced the additional funding  measures on a 50:50 cost share arrangement.

The additional LGAs are Adelaide Hills, Kingston, Mid Murray, Mount Barker, Murray Bridge  and the Yorke Peninsula. Businesses on Kangaroo Island are already eligible for the grants.

Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management David Littleproud said today’s  announcement would extend government support to 2000 local businesses.

“This grants package has already seen over 8000 applications across bushfire impacted  communities in the three weeks since it was launched, with $85 million immediately paid to  small business,” he said.

“We have made the application process simple and easy to take the burden off small business  owners, and to have them back on their feet as quickly as possible.

“It’s critical we continue to maintain a stimulus for small businesses affected by this summer’s  bushfires, now more than ever as they endure further hurt as a result of COVID -19. The  Australian Government will continue to offer its support through whatever means necessary.”

South Australia’s Minister for Innovation and Skills David Pisoni said the grants would support  small businesses which continue to face the devastating impacts of the bushfires.

“The Government of South Australia is committed to finding every opportunity to work with the  community and industry to build back better in bushfire affected areas,” Minister Pisoni said.

“We are partnering with the Commonwealth Government to ensure there is financial  assistance for small businesses impacted by the bushfires.”
