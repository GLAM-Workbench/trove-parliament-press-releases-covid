SCOTT MORRISON ADDS BILLION DOLLAR ADVERTISING BILL TO

TRILLION DOLLAR DEBT



Scott Morrison is about to become the billion-dollar man when it comes to wasting public

money on taxpayer funded advertising.



Taxpayers have spent $913 million on advertising since the year the Government took office

and at the current rate Scott Morrison will crack the $1 billion mark this year.



Scott Morrison’s gift to Australia is a trillion-dollar debt and a billion-dollar bill for self-promotion.



His obsession is marketing, photo-ops and favours for Liberal mates, rather than delivering for

Australians.



For example, in 18 months Mr Morrison has failed to invest a cent from his $4 billion fund for

bushfire relief and natural disaster mitigation. But as communities affected by last year’s

bushfires continue to struggle, he has given a former Coalition staffer $190,000 to produce

video material for his bushfire response marketing.



He has splashed $15 million on the “Our Comeback” economic campaign this financial year,

based on $1 million worth of research by a Liberal mate.



In another indication of his warped priorities, Mr Morrison recently announced plans for a $24

million Coronavirus vaccine marketing campaign before he had even finalised plans for the

actual roll-out of the vaccine.



Then there was the $140 million pre-election advertising blitz in 2018-19, which included $15.9

million towards the dud “Powering Forward” campaign later criticised by the Australian National

Audit Office.



Mr Morrison’s professional background is marketing. First as Treasurer, and now as Prime

Minister, he has made an artform of using public money on self-promotion.



He treats taxpayers’ money as though it is the Liberal Party’s money.



Mr Morrison’s obsession with advertising is matched only by his propensity to make grand

announcements but fail to deliver.



Scott Morrison is always there for the photo-op but never there for the follow up.
