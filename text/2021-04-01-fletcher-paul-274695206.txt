An extra $2 million for Queensland’s creative sector to RISE

Eleven creative organisations across Queensland will share in more than $2 million under the second  batch of grants from the Morrison Government’s $200 million Restart Investment to Sustain and  Expand (RISE) Fund, which is designed to reactivate live performance venues and events.

Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher MP,  said the latest RISE funding will begin to flow immediately to creative sector organisations throughout  Queensland, to restart, re-imagine or create new cultural and creative activities.

“The Arts and entertainment sector is fundamental to Queensland’s identity, supporting cultural  expression, community and social wellbeing, along with a significant boost to employment and  economic benefits for the state,” Minister Fletcher said.

“We’re pleased to see nearly $2 million flow immediately to restart the sector, which will support 11  innovative projects and create more than 2,200 job opportunities.”

One of the largest grant recipients in Queensland is the National Association of Cinema Operators -  Australasia, which will receive $250,000 in funding to present the Australian International Movie  Convention, the largest convention of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere.

A reimagined COVID-safe festival, Blues on Broadbeach, will receive more than $200,000 in funding  to see the event return with more than 85,000 attendees expected this year.

On 25 March the Morrison Government announced the RISE Fund will be boosted with an extra $125  million to support around 230 projects and up to 90,000 jobs, building on an original commitment of  $75 million.

In November 2020 more than $60 million in funding was announced under Batch One of the Fund.

The successful Queensland projects listed below are part of 61 projects funded under Batch Two of  RISE. The full list of Batch Two recipients will be announced in the coming weeks at:  www.arts.gov.au/covid-19-update
