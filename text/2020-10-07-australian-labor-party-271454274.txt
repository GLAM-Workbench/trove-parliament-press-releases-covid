EVEN AFTER SO MUCH TRAGEDY MORRISON GOVERNMENT STILL HAS  NO PLAN FOR AGED CARE

Despite 674 older Australians tragically passing away from COVID-19 the Budget confirms  the Morrison Government still has no plan to fix our country’s broken aged care system.

The Morrison Government has failed every single older Australian who has died by not  acting now.

Shockingly the Budget has no significant new funding for residential aged care where so  many older Australians have died.

Ã¢ÂÂ¨The home care packages announced by the Morrison Government won’t come close to  meeting demand or addressing the significant concerns of the Aged Care Royal  Commission.

Ã¢ÂÂ¨There are more than 103,000 older Australians waiting for home care and the impact of  COVID-19 will only see more older Australians join the queue.

23,000 ‘additional’ packages is just a drop in the ocean, more older Australians died than  this waiting for care in the last three years alone.

Ã¢ÂÂ¨Time and time again the Morrison Government’s announcements of new home care  packages have failed to address the true scale of Australia’s aged care crisis.Ã¢ÂÂ¨ Ã¢ÂÂ¨The  Morrison Government should immediately come clean on just how many of these home  care packages are new.

Documents tendered at the Aged Care Royal Commission recently revealed the Morrison  Government will deliver just 300 ‘new’ home care packages by 2024 despite a series of  announcements promising tens of thousands more.

Ã¢ÂÂ¨In calling for action on the unacceptable number of older Australians waiting for care, the  Royal Commission’s interim report called the home care package waiting list  ‘neglect’.Ã¢ÂÂ¨ Ã¢ÂÂ¨This latest announcement confirms exactly what Labor said when the  Government first responded to the Royal Commission’s interim report: Scott Morrison was  not doing enough.



Day after day the evidence mounts of serious neglect in aged care and every day all we  see from the Morrison Government is running away, passing the buck and not accepting  responsibility for its own failures.

Neglect. That’s the legacy of this Government when it comes to aged care.
