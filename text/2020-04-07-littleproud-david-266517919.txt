Be biosecurity aware when buying goods from overseas

Ã¯ÂÂ· Impact of COVID-19 may lead to an increase in online shopping and goods  being purchased from overseas   Ã¯ÂÂ· Everyone must follow Australia’s biosecurity conditions when buying goods  online   Ã¯ÂÂ· Food, plants, seeds, meat and pet treats are a biosecurity risk and may not be

permitted

The impact of COVID-19 may lead to an increase in online shopping and goods being  purchased from overseas, but it is important to remember that some goods may not be  permitted as they pose a biosecurity risk.

Minister for Agriculture, Water and Emergency Management, David Littleproud, said  everyone must follow Australia’s biosecurity conditions when buying goods online from  overseas and be confident that the seller is reliable.

“My department is preparing for a significant increase in international mail, as a result of  the impacts of COVID-19 and the reduction in traveller numbers,” Minister Littleproud said.

“We already intercept a large volume of risk items at our mail centres each year, with more  than 75,000 items of biosecurity concern intercepted across Australia in 2019.

“If you are considering buying goods online, ensure those goods are permitted, you are  confident about their origin and the seller is reliable.

“But the best way to protect Australia’s biosecurity is to buy locally rather than overseas  and it helps our economy.

“Items such as food, plants, seeds, meat and pet treats can be considered a biosecurity  risk and may be seized and destroyed if they arrive at our mail centres.

“Seeds can carry viruses that could threaten our fruit and vegetable industry, while meat  and pet treats can carry risks like African swine fever, which could devastate our pork  industry.

“If you are considering purchasing food or seeds for sowing, remember that Australia has  strong food security, producing enough food for 75 million people with a population of only  25 million.

“The same rules apply if you are expecting to receive gifts or other goods in the mail from  family and friends overseas, so make sure you pass the message on.

“This is a challenging time, but by keeping these things in mind you can avoid wasting  money and do your part to support Australia’s biosecurity.”

Biosecurity officers, detector dogs and x-ray machines are in place at international mail  centres to inspect incoming parcels. Goods that are deemed to pose a biosecurity risk are  seized and destroyed, or they can be re-exported at the expense of the customer.

Australia has strict conditions for the import of certain goods, including those purchased  online. Some products require an import permit and others simply may not be permitted.

If you are found to breach Australia’s biosecurity conditions when purchasing goods from  overseas, you may be subject to an investigation and possible criminal prosecution.
