PETER DUTTON:



Thank you very much for being here. I’m really quite delighted and honoured to have  Ambassador Culvahouse here at the ACCCE today. The Australian Centre to Counter Child  Exploitation is obviously something that has been in the planning for a long period of time.  The officers, the investigators, the analysts, people who support the work of the officers  here do an incredible job and they’re renowned worldwide.

Part of the reason of the success of the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation is not  only because of our domestic relationships with the Australian Federal Police and the state  policing authorities, other intelligence agencies like AUSTRAC, ACIC, etc, but it’s also made  what it is today, and the success that we enjoy here, is because of the international  collaborations.

There’s no greater partner that we have in the fight against those people, those  perpetrators who would seek to sexually assault children than the United States of America.  Ambassador, I want to say thank you through you to the officers of Homeland Security, of  the FBI and other agencies that we deal with on a regular basis in the United States.

The work of the Five Eyes partners, which obviously includes the United States, the United  Kingdom, New Zealand, ourselves and Canada, really is quite a remarkable collaboration in  the counter terrorism space; the work that we do there, the exchange of intelligence and  information in the defence space - obviously there’s a very long-established collaboration -  but equally now in this space, to protect children and to deal with transnational crime; the

2



relationship that we have with the FBI, with the Department of Homeland Security is quite  remarkable.

Scores of children have been saved from the hands of predators, either in the real world or  online, because of the relationship between Australia and the United States. The  information that we receive as part of a number of operations that have recently been  closed have directly resulted in Australian children being saved, and saved from either  currently being sexually abused or would into the future and that is quite a remarkable  outcome.

So Ambassador, thank you so much for being here today. Your friendship to our country  obviously has been quite remarkable and your service to the United States, both  domestically and abroad, is renowned, and you have been a great friend during the course  of your term here in Australia.

I'm very grateful for the personal commitment that you’ve given to the relationship with  Australia and we really pay tribute to what you’ve been able to do during your period as  Ambassador. I hope that you’ll enjoy the opportunity to speak to some of our officers here  today because they do remarkable work. This is the toughest area of policing - there’s no  question about that - and the fact that they turn up each day and are involved in operations  that save children is quite remarkable. I hope they will leave the same impression on you as  they have done on me. Ambassador, I’ll ask you to say a few words.

ARTHUR CULVAHOUSE:

Surely. Thank you Minister. It's a privilege to be here today with you. You were one of the  first senior officials in government that I met when I arrived in March in 2019 and I really  have enjoyed and appreciated working with you in the common interest of our two great  countries ever since.

The relationship between Australia and United States is strong indeed. It’s best known on  the defence side and the Five Eyes intelligence sharing side, but also the United States is  Australia’s largest and most important economic partner.

Here today, we point out the deep and enduring law enforcement alliance and bonds  between our two countries. It's my sincere pleasure to visit this centre. I am well advised,  Minister, of your strong leadership in bringing this centre to reality. It does important work.  It provides law enforcement response to the ever-growing criminal syndicates that operate  without borders, beyond borders and it requires a response that is international in scope,  and that brings all the resources of our two countries and other countries to bear.

I look forward to the tour here today. The people here do really important work. In my  Embassy every week we have a country team meeting and our law enforcement liaisons  with Government of Australia, FBI, Homeland Security and our intelligence side, all report  on cases that are under review, that are under way, that are either out or about to be  brought to a conclusion because of work that our two governments do.

The work that is done in this centre complements work that’s done in the United States in  the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, and that centre has referred over  17,000 leads this year to this centre alone. In response, Australia has referred many leads to  us, and there are many, many cases where children that were in the process of being  exploited, in the process of being abused, in just a few hours’ time, because of leads on one  side or the other, Australia or the US, US to Australia, where children were rescued from  severe exploitation and abuse.

So, this is a great alliance story. Thank you for your leadership. I look forward very much to  the tour I'm about to receive and to hearing all the good work. I bought our law  enforcement team with us today just to thank your Department, to thank the AFP, and  thank all the good people here for being such good partners and allies and doing in every  respect some of the most important work that could be done in the world of law  enforcement.

PETER DUTTON:



Ambassador, thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, I might just invite questions of  the Ambassador in relation to the centre. There’s another matter that I wanted to cover, but  I might do that after the Ambassador’s answered any questions and stepped off, and then I  can cover that issue then. So, is there any questions of the Ambassador?

QUESTION:

Mr Ambassador, it’s not about the centre, but can we please get your view on the 14-point  list of grievances China has with Australia.

ARTHUR CULVAHOUSE:

It's an interesting list, you’re talking about the Wolf Warrior list in Canberra. Look, I'll be a  little bit undiplomatic. I think that list reflects instances of the Government of Australia  standing up for its own interest and furthering the national interest of Australia. I'll probably  let the Government of Australia respond to it, but I don't think you would ever see - let me  say it more clearly - you would never see a United States Embassy hand such a list to a  reporter in Australia. That is not the way to do diplomacy. That is not the way that one  should deal with concerns. It should be done government-to-government and that sort of  interference I don't think you would see the United States engage in.

QUESTION:

While we’re on other topics, what’s the future for you here? Will you be hoping to head  back to the US for the holiday period and will we see you back here after that?

ARTHUR CULVAHOUSE:

I'm a political Ambassador, a political appointee. I understand those rules. Political  Ambassadors, almost without exception, return home when there is a change of

4



Administration and I expect between now and January 20 that I’ll be heading back to the  United States.

QUESTION:

What do you make of the way the election has played out back at home for you? We’ve  seen Donald Trump launch numerous lawsuits for example, your New Zealand counterpart  was slightly critical of him coming out and claiming victory in the election before the votes  have counted. Do you agree with that criticism?

ARTHUR CULVAHOUSE:

Look, maybe the only advantage of being as old as I am, is I’ve been involved, until this year,  and I am prohibited by Federal Law from engaging in personal political activity, but I’ve been  involved in every Presidential race since 1976 and what I will say about this process, it’s a  process that’s playing out according to our Constitution.

The states are certifying or counting all the votes, they’re certifying the victors, with the  view of our electoral college, which is a somewhat novel institution, we’ll meet in  Washington on 14 December to pick the next President of the United States, that person  will be ratified by our Congress on 8 January, then we will formally as a constitutional  matter, have a President Elect. But in the interim, the General Services Administration has  ascertained - an interesting word - that former Vice-President Biden should have all of the  benefits of transition and the current Administration has pledged its cooperation.

So I think if you look at Bush v Gore in the year 2000, it was 37 days before we got to this  stage which we’re here now. So, by that standard, if you’re old, this is not unusual, not  remarkable.

QUESTION:

Ambassador, just on the centre here, at the official opening the Minister had some quite  strong words to say about Facebook and encryption, and how that was, sort of, hurting your  prospects of investigating some of these crimes. What’s the US Government’s position on  that sort of encryption, and what are they doing to perhaps get more cooperation from the  tech giants?

ARTHUR CULVAHOUSE:

Well that’s an issue that is under very careful review. I don’t want to engage in domestic  Australian politics so I’m best to refer back to Minister Dutton. But as the social media  companies have grown in size and scale, as more and more leads are to be found in those  venues, it’s an issue that I would hope and expect that US social media companies would  cooperate fully with US, Australia and international law enforcement to allow us to, you  know, think about what we’re talking about today, to allow us to rescue children from the  hands of people who would harm them and exploit them.

There has to be a way through that somewhat fraught minefield. In our country, we have  the First Amendment, which is a barrier to law enforcement, in this country there may be  less impediments.

PETER DUTTON:



Thank you very much Ambassador.

I just wanted to update you in relation to a matter that’s currently before the court, but in  November 2005, Abdul Nacer Benbrika was arrested as part of Operation Pendennis, some  of you will have a memory of that.

The court heard that Benbrika spoke of killing 1,000 people to achieve the groups  objectives. He was charged with possessing a thing connected with the preparation of a  terrorist attack and in February 2009, the Supreme Court of Victoria sentenced Benbrika to  15 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years.

His sentence was comprised of one term of seven years for intentionally being a member of  a terrorist organisation, one term of 15 years for intentionally directing the activities of a  terrorist organisation, and one term of five years for possession of a thing connected with  the preparation of a terrorist act.

Benbrika appealed his conviction sentence, as you’d know, but today I can confirm that on  the 20th of November I cancelled the Australia citizenship of convicted terrorist Abdul Nacer  Benbrika.

He’s the first individual to have lost his citizenship onshore under the terrorism related  provisions of the Australian Citizenship Act of 2007 and given Benbrika no longer holds  Australian citizenship, he’s granted an ex-citizen visa by operation of law, under the  Migration Act.

Benbrika has been notified of his citizenship loss and he’ll remain in prison whilst an interim  detention order is enforced, pending the courts consideration of the application for a  continuing detention order.

I do want to pay tribute and thank all of the law enforcement officers and agencies who  worked on Operation Pendennis. This was the most significant counter-terrorism  investigation in Australia’s history and it no doubt saved countless lives.

I can confirm today, also, that 20 dual-nationals cease to hold Australian citizenship as a  result of their engagement in terrorist conduct, but he is the first onshore, as I point out. .

So I’m happy to take questions on any of these matters.

QUESTION:

Minister, you mentioned the continuing detention order, so has the Government applied for  that order in relation to Benbrika and is it still underway?

PETER DUTTON:



It’s not a matter that I’m going to comment on because it’s before the court at the moment.  But the Commonwealth’s made its position very clear in relation to the risk that we deem  Benbrika still to pose to the Australian public - and don’t forget, this is a very serious  conviction, and the penalties highlight that - so we believe that it is appropriate, in this  circumstance, to take the action that we have, and that’s before the court at the moment.

QUESTION:

Lawyers have raised concerns that this would effectively take Benbrika out of the reach of  Australian authorities working to defend in the future, is that a concern for you?

PETER DUTTON:



My concern is to keep Australians safe. So in this instance, he spoke about thousands of  Australians being killed, and that’s what he advocated at the time. He’s convicted,  obviously, in relation to those matters and it doesn’t matter who it is if it’s a person that’s  posing significant terrorist threat to our country, then we will do whatever is possible within  Australian law to protect Australians, and that remains our priority in relation to Benbrika,  we’re taking action in the court at the moment that we believe will give us the best  opportunity to keep Australians safe.

QUESTION:

Sorry, Minister, just a question on a separate matter, should taxpayers be funding a RAAF  plane to help Mathias Cormann get a job with the OECD?

PETER DUTTON:



Well, the short answer is yes - and I remember speaking with Richard Marles about his  many trips overseas on behalf of Kevin Rudd at the time, for advocacy for votes within the  United Nations - and that’s entirely appropriate.

It would be a very significant win for our country if Mathias Cormann is able to achieve the  outcome. For us to have an influence in the OECD, particularly in a period of recovery after  the COVID virus - so over the next five to 10 years - the world economy is going to have an  incredibly important impact on Australians - and for somebody as successful and as  credentialed as Mathias Cormann to be at the head of that organisation, to speak with the  knowledge that he’s obtained as having been Australia’s most successful Finance Minister, I  think would be a great win for Australia and I think it’s something we should be very proud  of, but there’s always a cost that’s associated with the visits, and with the lobbying that goes

7



on to get the requisite votes to take that position. I hope he’s successful because that would  be a great outcome for Australia.

QUESTION:

But you’re confident the taxpayers would think it’s okay that it’s their financial, I guess, their  cost to bear?

PETER DUTTON:



Well, I think Australians understand that there’s a cost associated with us lobbying and  becoming successful in this outcome because if we are, if Mathias is successful in obtaining  that job at the OECD, that is a great win for Australia.

Now, internationally at the moment Australia is already compared very favourably with a  number of other countries. Given the handling of the virus, the early decisions we took in  relation to closing the border with China first, and then with the rest of the world, and the  way in which we’ve been able to respond in our health system and to manage people  coming back across the border, or indeed to depart to our international borders. So I think  Australia has a big role to play in the world to provide support to other countries, to make  sure that the world economy is in as good a shape as it possibly can be - as I hope we  rebound from COVID as soon as possible - but there is a cost associated with that, and I  think on that basis Australians would support it.

QUESTION:

Just back to Benbrika for a moment, has he appealed the citizenship decision?

PETER DUTTON:



Well he’s been made aware of it and what he does next is an issue for him.

QUESTION:

And how many of the applications that the Government has made for continuing detention  orders since 2017, how many of those have been successful?

PETER DUTTON:



I think it’s important in relation to this issue to point out that there are a number of ways in  which the Federal Police, particularly where they’re working jointly with the state police  authorities, or indeed their international colleagues, where they make a decision to either  seek a CDO or to disrupt, or potentially arrest somebody for, you know, sort of on an Al  Capone basis, so if there are other offences that they have committed, where they could be  sentenced and sent to jail, there are a number of ways in which they can deal with that  threat.

Now, we’ve cancelled passports for example of people who are offshore, which again, is  another containment method. We’ve gone through each of the individual cases of those  people that we think are the highest risk - there are many - and we know that there are  many who are emerging that we’re concerned about, that ASIO and others are dealing with  at the moment and they will look at, with the advice of the Australian Government Solicitor,  each of those cases, and we will implement a plan that we think is the best way to contain  that threat.

QUESTION:

But, specifically, on continuing detention?

PETER DUTTON:



That’s the only thing I’d have to say in relation to CDOs.

QUESTION:

[inaudible]?

PETER DUTTON:



As I say, I think if you look at the way in which we look at each individual case, I think that’s  actually a better way to have a look at it.

QUESTION:

So, does that mean those continuing potential orders are…they’re redundant?

PETER DUTTON:



Well it means it’s an option in some cases, but in other cases there’s a better way to deal  with that individual.

QUESTION:

Well, in how many cases have you made those applications?

PETER DUTTON:



Well again, I think if you look at the individual cases, it may be that the CDO is available to  us, but we haven’t sought that outcome because there’s a better way to deal with it and in  my judgement, and on the judgement of Director-General of ASIO, the best way to have a  look at that.

QUESTION:

So have you sought that outcome at all?

PETER DUTTON:



Well I’ll just refer you back to what I said.

QUESTION:

If there is no successful appeal, would you be looking to remove him from the country as  soon as possible, even if there was time left on his prison time?

PETER DUTTON:



If there’s the ability to remove threats from Australia or to stop them coming back to  Australia to commit a terrorist act here, then of course we would look at any of those  options. It would depend on the home country, it would depend on the period of  incarceration that might still have to be served, but generally speaking people would serve  out their sentence and then be deported or be placed into immigration detention until they  can be deported from Australia. The more that we can stop these people from coming back  to Australia, the quicker we can deport these people, the safer the Australian public  remains.

QUESTION:

I know you referred me back…

PETER DUTTON:



…if it’s on this topic, I’ve got nothing further, but if there’s another issue, I’m happy to  answer that question.

QUESTION:

Alright. Well I do have another question.

PETER DUTTON:

Okay.

QUESTION:

Do you think the military should go ahead with the raw stripping of medals from the Special  Operations Task-?

PETER DUTTON:



That’s an issue for the Defence Minister or the CDF to answer. Thanks very much.
