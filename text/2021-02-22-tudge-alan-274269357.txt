Job-ready Graduates package seeing more students in courses  with better job outcomes



Early data for 2021 shows that the Government’s Job-ready Graduates package is  having the intended impact: more students studying overall, and more applying to  courses in areas of expected job growth.

Minister for Education and Youth Alan Tudge said that while final data won’t be  available until later in the year, preliminary data from Tertiary Admissions Centres  (TACs) was promising.

“Our intent was to encourage more students into courses where there was the best  chance of getting a job. Pleasingly, this is now happening, with applications for  courses such as agriculture up 16 per cent and applications in health up 15.5 per  cent,” Minister Tudge said.

“We’re also seeing more people applying to study education, architecture and IT - all  areas where we expect to see job growth in coming years.

“Pleasingly, the data shows a seven per cent increase in overall applications,  meaning more Australians are looking to begin tertiary study in 2021.

“Our Job-ready Graduates package is a significant reform and provides up  to 30,000 more opportunities for Australians to get a degree and get into a job in  2021.

“Students will ultimately make up their own minds about what to study, but we make  no apologies for encouraging Australians to study in areas of expected job growth.

“We’re investing a record $20 billion in higher education in 2021, including $550  million for extra university and short course places and an additional $1 billion for  research that will flow into universities this year.

“This all about getting Australians the skills and qualifications they need to get a job  in our post-COVID economic recovery.”

About two-thirds of higher education applications are made through TACs, with the  remaining applications made directly through universities.
