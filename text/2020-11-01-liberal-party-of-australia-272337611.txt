Record childhood vaccination rates through COVID-19

More Australian families are vaccinating their children, with new figures showing four  quarters of growth in all childhood coverage rates to September 2020, the highest on record.

Each year, the Morrison Government invests more than $400 million in the National  Immunisation Program to protect young and vulnerable Australians.

The highest rates of vaccination are among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children at  five years, at more than 97 per cent.

The coverage rate for all five-year-olds continues to grow towards the aspirational 95 per cent  target. In the year to September 2020, it reached 94.9 per cent.

Among all two-year-old children, the coverage rate has risen to almost 92.4 per cent, which is  the first time it has climbed above 92 per cent since 2014. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander two-year-old vaccination rate has also risen to almost 91.2 per cent in the current  quarter.

The overall vaccination rate for one-year-olds has also increased in the last twelve months,  reaching 94.7 per cent, while Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander one-year-old vaccination  rate increased to 93.5 per cent.

The positive results are a clear indication that the Morrison Government’s Childhood  Immunisation Education Campaign is getting results. The most recent phase of the campaign  specifically target parents of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 0-5 years.

As we remain focused on COVID-19, it’s important that we don’t lose sight of the other  preventable diseases with which Australian families must contend.

Our vaccines in the National Immunisation Program are safe, effective and provide a key  national response to save and protect young lives.
