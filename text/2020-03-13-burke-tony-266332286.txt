MORRISON MUST SUPPORT THE ARTS THROUGH CORONAVIRUS  CRISIS

Australia’s arts sector was already fragile before the coronavirus crisis due to  the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison Government’s cuts and neglect.

Now with live performance ticket sales dropping and the list of cancelled events  growing rapidly, the sector could be brought to the brink over coming months.

Most performers are literally ‘gig workers’: no show means no income.

The same goes for the people who help put the shows together.

But so far the government has been completely silent on an industry which  contributes $50 billion to the Australian economy and employs hundreds of  thousands of Australians, including many in regional areas.

This isn’t good enough.

The Government has announced specific measures to support the tourism  industry. Live performance is similarly vulnerable to this crisis and needs help.

The Government needs a plan for the arts sector and we need to hear what it is  - urgently.
