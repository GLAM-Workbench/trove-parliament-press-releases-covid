RESPECT, CARE AND DIGNITY:  AGED CARE ROYAL COMMISSION  $452 MILLION IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AS GOVERNMENT COMMITS  TO HISTORIC REFORM TO DELIVER RESPECT AND CARE FOR SENIOR

AUSTRALIANS

The Australian Government welcomes the Final Report from the Royal Commission into Aged Care  Quality and Safety, which has today been tabled in Parliament, noting its significant and sweeping  proposals for reform of the aged care sector.

As a country it is important that we all acknowledge that we need to do more to ensure senior  Australians are treated with respect, care and dignity and have access to quality care as they age.

The Royal Commission’s Final Report recognises the immense effort of our nurses and carers but  also brings the challenges of aged care services into clear focus. The Government is committed to  transforming aged care and the Royal Commission’s monumental report, with 148  recommendations, delivers a challenging, but achievable road to reform.

Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, said it was clear from the Royal Commission’s work that while  significant progress has been made, there is a clear roadmap to improve respect and care for our  older Australians.

“I called this Royal Commission to ensure our oldest and most frail Australians could receive the  respect and care that supports their dignity, and recognises the contribution that they have made to  society,” the Prime Minister said.

“I warned when I called the Royal Commission there will be stories that will be hard to hear.  And  that has been the case.  But at the same time, we have also heard heart-warming cases of dedication

and with the challenges of COVID-19 in the past year, we need to acknowledge the hard work  performed by our aged care workforce.

“As I noted at the time, Australians must be able to trust that their loved ones will be cared for  appropriately and the community should have confidence in the system. This remains our clear goal.

“Today, the Australian Government is continuing to drive reforms with additional funding of $452.2  million to address immediate priorities in the sector.”

These immediate steps will drive improved quality of care by strengthening aged care provider  governance, and improved oversight of home care which will ensure senior Australians and  taxpayers are getting value for money.

It will provide additional financial assistance for residential care providers so they can improve care,  whilst building the much needed workforce of the future to support Australians who want to age in  their own homes.

Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, reiterated the Australian Government’s commitment to the  necessary reform of aged care.

“The Royal Commission’s report is a significant document, the culmination of a two year inquiry, and  demands a carefully considered response,” Minister Hunt said.

“We thank the Royal Commissioners and commit to the two fundamental principles of respect and  care for our elders. We responded quickly to the Royal Commission’s interim report and its special  report on COVID-19, with additional investments in the priority areas identified by the Royal  Commission.

“The Government announced a $537 million package in November 2019 in response to the Interim  Report, with a focus on more home care packages, reducing the number of young people living in  residential aged care, and improving medication management.

“As part of the Government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic in aged care $1.8 billion was  committed last year, including a $132 million package in November 2020. This funding is increasing  access to mental health support and allied health services for aged care residents, and has provided  significant additional financial support to improve infection prevention and control and workforce  capability in aged care facilities during the pandemic.

“Today, we announce a further $452.2 million package as an initial step in responding to this Final  Report.

“Our comprehensive response to the Royal Commission final report will be driven by the principle of  respect and care and through the lens of five broad pillars -   1. Home Care,   2. Residential aged care quality and safety,

3. Residential aged care services and sustainability,   4. Workforce, and   5. Governance.

“The five pillars will underpin the Australian Government’s response, along with its reform agenda  and the implementation of those changes.”





1. Supporting older Australians who choose to access Home Care

The Australian Government knows with more Australians wishing to stay in their own homes as they  age, there is increasing demand for appropriate services to help them do so. This has been a key  focus of the recommendations of the Royal Commission.

Since the 2018-19 Budget, the Government has invested a total of $5.5 billion in new funding to  deliver more than 83,000 additional home care packages, including 10,000 packages announced in  December 2020.

Minister Hunt said service providers must focus on the senior Australians at the centre of their work,  to ensure their needs are met and that the care they receive continues to be tailored as those needs  change.

“The Australian Government will immediately invest more than $18 million to enhance the oversight  of the Government’s Home Care Packages Program, to deliver better value for senior Australians and  the Australian taxpayer,” Minister Hunt said.

“Our Government expects home care providers to offer real value for money - and for the delivery  of care, rather than any unjustified administrative fees, to make up the lion’s share of the cost. I  expect our increased oversight will put downward pressure on any unfair administrative charges  while supporting providers to deliver quality and safe services.”

Enhancing oversight of the delivery of home care packages will lead to more care and services going  directly to care recipients and reduce the potential for fraud in the system.



2. Quality and safety in residential aged care delivers dignity alongside care

The Australian Government is committed to driving improvements to quality of care and safety for  senior Australians.

Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services, Richard Colbeck, said the Government will  review and enhance the sector’s quality standards with a focus on areas of concern identified in the  report, including governance, diversity, dementia, food and nutrition.

“Funding worth $32 million will immediately be allocated to enhancing the capacity of the Aged Care  Quality and Safety Commission and greater regulation around the use of restraints in care,” Minister  Colbeck said.

Eligible providers will be able to access programs to build their corporate and clinical governance  across their Boards, to support increased accountability through strengthened legislative obligations.  This will complement broader reforms, including improvements to provider governance and  regulation.

“The use of physical and chemical restraint is a particular area of focus for the Royal Commission,  and our Government has announced a number of measures to drive cultural change in this area  following an independent review into the issue.

“In response to the Royal Commission, the Government will further establish clear new obligations  and guidelines around the use of restraint to protect older Australians receiving care. A Senior  Restraint Practitioner will be appointed to the Commission to lead an education campaign for the  sector and general practitioners, to minimise the use of restraint, and bring practice into line with  those in the disability sector.”



3. Investing to drive improvements in residential aged care Services and Sustainability

Minister Colbeck said the Australian Government wants to ensure there continues to be stable and  reliable residential aged care options for senior Australians.

“The Australian Government committed more than $14.1 billion in 2020-21 towards residential aged  care, up from $9.2 billion in 2012-13 and reaching an estimated $17.1 billion by 2023-24,” Minister  Colbeck said.

“In response to the Royal Commission report, the Australian Government will immediately invest an  additional $189.9 million for residential care providers to provide stability and maintain services  while the Government considers the recommendations of the Royal Commission’s Final Report.

“This support equates to around $760 per resident in metropolitan residential aged care, and $1,145  for those in rural, regional and remote areas.”

In addition, the Government will invest $90 million to support a Viability Fund to assist those  facilities which are facing financial challenges, particularly as we see the sector start to restructure  and respond to the changing choices of people to live at home longer.



4. Workforce: growing a passionate and skilled aged care workforce

As more Australians are supported to remain in their homes, there will be an increasing demand for  skilled personal care workers (PCWs).

In response to the Royal Commission, the Government will immediately invest $92 million to create  over 18,000 places for workers between now and mid-2023.

“There will be a significant increase in activity to attract job seekers into the sector, and a new Home  Care Workforce Support Program will provide additional targeted support, including assistance to  employers to access support and training for new recruits,” Minister Hunt said.

“The total value of measures to grow the skilled and professional aged care workforce is almost $92  million over four years.”



5. Governance: oversight, standards and accountability - a new era

The Prime Minister said community confidence and the trust of senior Australians and their families  would be bolstered by changes which bring transparency, accountability and oversight.

“Along with the measures to further develop residential aged care governance, our Government is  also strengthening the arm of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, by appointing an

Assistant Commissioner for Sector Capability with responsibility for leading a transformative change  program,” he said.

Minister Colbeck said the enhanced oversight of the home care system will ensure senior Australians  receive the quality of care they expect and that they get good value for the considerable investment  made by families themselves and by Government in aged care.

In response to the Royal Commission, the Government will immediately invest $30.1 million to  strengthen the governance of aged care providers and legislative governance obligations on the  sector.

Minister Hunt also confirmed that work will immediately commence to replace the Aged Care Act  1997, providing a strong, fresh foundation to enable the reforms to be implemented and drive a  cultural change with the focus on responding to the needs of senior Australians.

All of these immediate measures announced today are a starting point for further reform.  Careful  consideration will be given to the Royal Commission report and the Government will outline the  path to transform aged care in the Budget.

The Prime Minister said, “Ultimately I called this Royal Commission as one of my first acts because I  believe we owe a duty of care to every older Australian to ensure they have respect and quality care.

“This report provides an honest assessment and an important roadmap to deliver still greater  respect and care for our older Australians. As a nation we commit to further honouring our elders  and giving them respect and care.”

The Government thanks the Royal Commissioners, the Honourable Tony Pagone QC and Lynelle  Briggs AO, for their considerable work in conducting the Royal Commission and all those who  contributed throughout the course of the inquiry.
