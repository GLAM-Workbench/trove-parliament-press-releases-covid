CITY DEAL’S FIRST YEAR SEES ADELAIDE FLYING INTO A BRIGHT FUTURE

Adelaide’s City Deal is delivering for the South Australian capital, with the first annual report  showcasing a boost for the local economy through job-creating investments.

The report highlights how the Deal is leveraging Adelaide’s strengths to make the city an  even better place to live, supporting local businesses and bolstering the city’s status as an  innovation hub.

The $649 million, 10-year deal between all three levels of government is also building on the  city’s global reputation as a cultural destination.

Achievements during the City Deal’s first 12 months include:  Ã¯ÂÂ· Opening the Australian Space Agency Headquarters in February, which is  already supporting 20 employees.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Grant awarded to local company Saber Astronautics to develop the new state-of-the-

art Mission Control Centre.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Construction began last week on the Australian Space Discovery Centre, which is  on track to open in early 2021.  Ã¯ÂÂ· An Expression of Interest released for the world-class Entrepreneur and

Innovation Centre - which will be the centrepiece of Lot Fourteen.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Awarding of two new contracts to deliver the $5.5 million Carrick Hill visitor  centre pavilion.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Approval of the implementation plan for the $3 million Aboriginal Entrepreneur Hub.

South Australian Premier Steven Marshall said a number of key projects under the Deal were  transforming Lot Fourteen in the north-eastern corner of Adelaide’s CBD into a world-leading  innovation precinct.

“Lot Fourteen is the centrepiece of the Adelaide City Deal, creating jobs across a range of  high-tech and high-growth sectors,” said the Premier.

“It’s already home to the Australian Space Agency, SmartSat CRC, Mission Control and the  Space Discovery Centre.

“The precinct is generating jobs for current and future generations - which will be critical in  the state’s economic recovery from the global Coronavirus pandemic.

Federal Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure Alan Tudge said the City  Deal was delivering projects that were supporting jobs, local businesses and the economy.

“These projects are building on what’s already great about Adelaide, making it an even better  place to live, visit, study, work and do business,” Mr Tudge said.

“We’ve achieved great momentum in the first year and we’re going to carry that through,  especially at a time when Adelaide and South Australia, like the rest of Australia, need the  economic stimulus.”

Lord Mayor of Adelaide Sandy Verschoor said the City Deal was also delivering projects  to improve the local experience on a number of fronts, including making the city safer and  better connected.

“The City of Adelaide has already completed initial scoping work for a suite of smart city  technology and infrastructure projects, with development of a business case and project  plan currently on track to be finalised by the end of the year,” Lord Mayor Verschoor said.

“These projects will deliver technologies like closed circuit television, smart lighting and  digital wayfinding to improve connectivity and safety in the city centre and deliver a  better experience for residents, visitors, workers and businesses alike.”

Significant progress has also been made by the South Australian Government on revitalising  the Mitcham Hills Trail and Glenthorne Loop to showcase the beautiful natural and cultural  experiences the city has to offer.

Work on the Marion Coast Walking Trail at Hallett Cove Conservation Park has already  been delivered and the revitalisation of some of Adelaide’s major cultural tourist attractions  including Kingston House, Wittunga Botanic Garden and Old Government House is  underway.

The Adelaide City Deal is a 10-year, $649 million agreement between the Australian  and South Australian Governments and the City of Adelaide.
