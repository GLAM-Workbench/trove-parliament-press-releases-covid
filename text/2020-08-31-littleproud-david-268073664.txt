Bushfire Royal Commission’s Interim Observations Welcome

The Australian Government has today welcomed the release of the Interim Observations  of the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements (the Bushfire Royal  Commission).

Minister for Emergency Management, David Littleproud, said the observations were  significant and came ahead of the Commission’s final report due in late October following  an extension owing to the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

“I extend my gratitude to the commission and all those who assisted for their work to date.  We will of course review the interim observations closely and continue to assist the Royal  Commission as it works towards the release of its final report on 28 October,” Minister  Littleproud said.

“The interim observations identify areas that all levels of government, separately and  collectively, can work on to improve our preparedness for upcoming disaster season.

“The Australian Government has already undertaken significant steps since the terrible  2019-20 bushfires to learn from that experience and ensure we’re better prepared for the  coming season.

“We have invested more than $2 billion to help communities recover from last summer’s  bushfires and have already committed significant funding to better prepare for the future  including in bushfire research, telecommunications and aerial firefighting.

“In addition, we are reviewing disaster recovery funding arrangements to deliver a more  equitable approach for all Australians.”

The Commission’s interim report is aimed at improving Australia's disaster preparedness  measures in the lead up to the coming bushfire season.

“The Australian Government will act quickly on the interim observations to ensure we are  better prepared to deal with future disasters,” Minister Littleproud said.
