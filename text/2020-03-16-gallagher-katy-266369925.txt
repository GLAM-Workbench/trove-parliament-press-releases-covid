RESPONSE BY FINANCIAL REGULATORS TO CORONAVIRUS

Labor welcomes today’s news that the Reserve Bank and Australia’s financial regulators  are taking coordinated action to support the functioning of markets, and boost credit,  liquidity and economic activity during this challenging time.

Coronavirus is having a substantial impact on Australian workers, families, businesses and  communities and has created significant uncertainty and volatility in financial markets.

The Reserve Bank is now set to pursue unconventional measures to support the financial  system and economy, having announced that it stands ready to purchase Australian  government bonds in the secondary market.

This comes as the RBA moves to boost liquidity through repurchase (repo) operations, and  follows ASIC’s decision this morning to limit trades by large equity market participants to  support the functioning of Australia’s financial system.

There is an ongoing role for the Government, the Reserve Bank, Australia’s financial  market regulators and the banks to ensure the continued flow of credit to impacted  businesses and organisations, and do what is necessary to support the economy and keep  markets liquid and working.

The Government needs to ensure its policy response to Coronavirus is coordinated across  government, including better coordination of its health and economic measures.

Each day it becomes clearer that the Morrison Government’s first stimulus package was  insufficient.

Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg must move to implement their original stimulus



package quickly and properly, and take additional steps to support Australia’s economy  and financial system as required.

Labor will continue to be supportive, responsible and constructive and that means injecting  a sense of urgency where it is lacking or absent.
