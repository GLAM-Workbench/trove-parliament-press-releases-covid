BILATERAL LOAN TO INDONESIA



On 12 November 2020, the Australian Treasurer, the Hon Josh Frydenberg MP, and Her Excellency  Dr Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Indonesian Minister of Finance, announced a Loan between Australia and  Indonesia.

Recognising the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and the strong friendship between Australia and  Indonesia, the Australian Government will provide an AUD1.5 billion loan to Indonesia, repayable  over 15 years. This loan supports the Asian Development Bank-led COVID-19 Active Response and  Expenditure Support Program.

COVID-19 poses an unprecedented challenge to the Indo-Pacific and the world. Both our nations have  been affected by this extraordinary crisis as containment measures and uncertainty have depressed  global economic activity and international trade.

The Loan will be used to support Indonesia’s budget financing for 2020 which is focused on managing  the COVID-19 crisis and economic recovery programmes.

The provision of the Australian Government loan to Indonesia reflects the extraordinary times which  we all must face together and is in recognition of Indonesia’s record of sound fiscal management which  has allowed the Government to respond to COVID-19 health crisis.

Indonesia’s recovery and ongoing prosperity is critical to the stability and security of our region.

The loan builds on our highly valued economic relationship and strong record of bilateral cooperation.  Australia and Indonesia are neighbours, friends and Comprehensive Strategic Partners, and we are  committed to supporting one another through this crisis.

Our governments will continue to engage and share our experiences as we move towards economic  recovery in the region.
