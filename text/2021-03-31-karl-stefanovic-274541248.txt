Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Dan Tehan interview with Karl  Stefanovic and Leila McKinnon, Today Show

SUBJECTS: COVID-19 vaccine rollout, Tourism and aviation support package,  Support for the tourism sector, Border closures

Karl Stefanovic: Okay, Federal Minister for Tourism Dan Tehan joins us now from Parliament  House in Canberra. Dan, good morning to you. I mean firstly, where do we start? I want to  ask you about this, the rollout of the vaccines. States still have half of their vaccines still  unused, that doesn’t help?

Dan Tehan: No, it doesn’t. So, we need to see the states and territories administering all the  vaccines that they have and we’ll continue to make sure we’re supplying them. But, it’s no  good if we’ve got half the stockpile sitting in warehouses. We need to make sure that it’s  being administered, especially to those frontline health workers and then our elderly  Australians, because the more Australians we can get vaccinated, the more we can move  around this country with confidence, and of course, support our wonderful tourism industry.  Because, we want to make sure that we’ve got Australians moving right across this great  country, visiting all those wonderful destinations.

Leila McKinnon: It really undermines initiatives like this, doesn’t it? Because, you’re trying to  get people moving, you’re trying to get people spending money, and this doesn’t help. Why  do you think it’s taking so long?

Tehan: Look, I’m not quite sure. One of the things that we want to reassure states and  territories again is that second dose is there. So, make sure you’re administering all those  first doses, because that second dose is there and we’re happy to work cooperatively with  them, to help them make sure that all those stockpiles are being rolled out and people are  being vaccinated, as we want them to be. So, we’ll be reaching out again to see what help  and assistance we can give them, but we really need them getting those jabs in people’s  arms.

Stefanovic: You would know too, Dan, Skroo Turner, disturbingly, in The Courier Mail this  morning, has come out saying that domestic travel is at risk and the airports are at risk  because of these lockdowns that happen and lockouts that happen. That is such disturbing  news for any of the tourism sector.

Tehan: It is and that’s why we want people to have the confidence to book a holiday, and I  know that what’s occurring in Brisbane has come at not a great time. But, we’ve got to  remember, we’ll get through this and these half-price flights, they go up until the end of  September, so, if anyone wants to travel to Queensland, be thinking about okay, when can I  go. You might want to go in July and there’s a half-price flight there available. Also, the  airlines have come on board and they’ve got discounts right across Australia at the moment,  as well. So, wherever you might want to go, there’s potentially a discounted flight there for  you, and remember - and this is the important message - you’re saving money on your  discount flights so we want you to dig deep when you get to your destination. Support the  restaurant, the cafÃÂ©, go on that wonderful experience that we have on offer across all our  wonderful destinations. So, we tend to in Australia, when we travel domestically, not spend  like we do overseas. So, I want to see Australians maxing out that credit card when you  travel in Australia and when you holiday in Australia.

Stefanovic: I love it.

McKinnon: I better be worried for the other Minister’s portfolios. How much of a body blow  would a potential Gold Coast lockdown be at a time like this?

Tehan: Look, obviously, the health authorities have to do what they need to do. But, we’ve  got to remember, these lockdowns, they will be temporary. The way that we’ve dealt with  these lockdowns is that we’ve got through them, we’ve got over them and the thing is, we’ve  just got to remember as we come out the other side, we need to be supporting the tourism  industry. We’ve got to be making sure we go, right, the best thing we can do is go and travel  to those destinations that have had a lockdown so we can support the tourism industry, the  cafes, the restaurants, the hotels, that’s what we need to be doing. And, we want to be  making sure we’re giving Australians the confidence to travel and that’s what this initiative is  about - $1.2 billion as part of this aviation and tourism sector initiative. So, to all Australians,  help and support our tourism industry at this moment. Obviously, Brisbane, not at the  moment, but we can go to wonderful destinations everywhere else across Australia, and  then once Brisbane’s through this, let’s get back to Brisbane and support them as well.

Stefanovic: But, the problem here, Dan, as you would know, is even with Brisbane, the  Greater Brisbane area, you can still go to the Gold Coast, which I think’s great. But, people  are going, oh, can I go to the Gold Coast or the Sunshine Coast. But, the rest of Queensland  has opened up and you had Gladys the other day saying, don’t go to Queensland, and there  are all these operators all the way along the coast that need people to go to Queensland. It’s  a big state and I think the premiers have all got to kind of work together on that.

Tehan: I couldn’t agree more with you, Karl, and one of the things that we’ve been pushing  from a Federal Government point of view is to get a national definition of a hotspot, so that  we can get a uniform position from states and territories as to how they deal with these  lockdowns, when they’re necessary. And, if all the states and territories could come together,  work with the Commonwealth so that we had a uniform position on what a hotspot definition  is, and then what states and territories would do in response, that would help give certainty  right across this nation to people who want to travel. And, you know, we call upon them  again, especially as we’re rolling the vaccine out, for them to be able to work together  cooperatively on that would just make such a difference to our tourism industry, in particular.

McKinnon: Okay. Thank you for that very much, Dan Tehan.

Stefanovic: Thanks, Dan.

Tehan: Pleasure.
