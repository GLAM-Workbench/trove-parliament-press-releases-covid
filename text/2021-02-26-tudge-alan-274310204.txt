Getting more for Australia from our university research

The Morrison Government has today launched the University Research  Commercialisation consultation paper on how to maximise the social and economic  benefits of Australia's multi-billion-dollar university research sector.

Speaking at the University of Melbourne today, Minster for Education and Youth Alan  Tudge said the government would seek feedback from universities, business and the  community.

"I want to see new ideas on how we can increase collaboration between business and  universities and put our research at the heart of our economic recovery," Minister Tudge  said.

"We want our high-quality research to better translate into the breakthrough products,  new businesses and ideas we need to grow our economy and improve our society.

"COVID provides a unique opportunity to reassess university business models and better  leverage research to grow our economy and generate Australian jobs.

"I will work with any university that is prepared to take a bold approach"

Research commercialisation is a priority for the Morrison Government. Last year, $5.8m  in funding was announced to begin to develop new solutions to increase research  commercialisation.

In November 2020, an Expert Panel of key business and research leaders was also  appointed to provide advice on the design, feasibility, and implementation of a research  commercialisation scheme.

The University Research Commercial/sat/on consultation paper is available on the  Department of Education, Skills and Employment website.

Responses to the consultation paper can be emailed to urcsÂ©dese.gov.au .
