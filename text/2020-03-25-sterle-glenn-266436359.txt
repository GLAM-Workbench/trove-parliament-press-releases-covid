GOVERNMENT MUST SUPPORT TRUCKIES DURING COVID-19

PANDEMIC



Long distance truck drivers are struggling to access toilets, showers and even

food at roadhouses due to concerns about COVID-19.



Overnight, I have received alarming reports from transport associations and

drivers about situations that Australia’s truck drivers are facing at roadhouses

across the country.



At some sites:



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Shower facilities are being closed.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Toilet facilities are being denied.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Drivers are being told that they cannot access meals on-site in air-conditioned areas. Drivers are instead being forced to eat outside in the

heat and amongst flies. For some drivers, this is the only guaranteed

rest break that they can take while driving long haul.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Due to takeaway options only being available now, healthy food options

for drivers are limited.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Due to the size of trucks, drivers are prevented from accessing some

fast food retailers.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ At some roadhouses, food sections are being closed.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Drivers are being prevented from using the rest/lounge areas while on

break.



I call on Transport Minister Michael McCormack to work with state counterparts

to address these issues.



During this pandemic, we need our truckies because it is they who are

supplying our shops and making sure that valuable freight is getting to where it

needs to go on a daily basis.



Being a truck driver is a hard and extremely stressful job. As a former owner-driver, running between Perth and Darwin, I understand better than anyone in

the Parliament the pressures our truckies face every day - fatigue

management, tight delivery deadlines and the fear of not being paid in an

adequate time frame to name a few. Drivers do not need the added fear of not

knowing when they are going to be able to have a shower, use a toilet or have

a feed during the COVID-19 crisis.



Earlier this week Mr McCormack described Australia’s truckies as the

“heartbeat of the nation”.



I agree with him.



Mr McCormack should take urgent steps to ensure our truckies can continue to

carry our country as they have always done.
