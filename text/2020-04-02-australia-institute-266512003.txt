Former Judges Call for Establishment of  NZ-Style Multi-Partisan COVID-19  Parliamentary Oversight Committee

A prominent group of former Australian judges who have been pursuing a federal anti-corruption watchdog have today called for the establishment of a bi-partisan parliamentary  oversight committee to ensure adequate scrutiny of the COVID-19 response while the Federal  Parliament is not sitting.

Such a body has already been established in New Zealand to help fill the accountability gap.  Known as the Epidemic Response Committee, it is an all-party special select committee with  similarly broad powers as those of a Privileges Committee regarding calling witnesses and  the provision of documents. The select committee was set up by consensus with all parties  represented, and hearings are publicly broadcast.

When Federal Parliament is recalled, we would urge the government to immediately establish  a multi-party select committee to enable scrutiny of the various Government programs  dealing with the COVID-19 crisis.

“Like Australia, New Zealand has shut down its Parliament due to COVID-19. However, NZ  has found a non-partisan alternative to maintain accountability. Should our Parliament be  recalled before August, it would be reassuring if the Parliament establishing such a multi-party select committee,” said The Hon Paul Stein AM QC, former judge of the NSW  Court of Appeal and former President of the Anti-Discrimination Board.

“The establishment of such a committee represents a clever and principled compromise  between the Government, which has rightly closed Parliament for public health reasons, and  Opposition Parties which equally rightly want Parliament sitting to hold the Government  accountable for its actions in a time of such crisis.

“The New Zealand Government has welcomed the oversight committee. Leader of the House  Chris Hipkins specifically acknowledged that the Government would make mistakes because  it must act so quickly and without perfect information, and said that the committee would  ensure those mistakes were picked up and remedied,” Stein said.

“An Epidemic Response Committee, established with the consensus of the Parliament, would  help secure accountability and give the Australian public confidence in the decisions of the  Government in this time of crisis,” said Ben Oquist, Executive Director of the Australia  Institute.

“In the middle of this unprecedented health and economic crisis, it is critical we do not let a  democratic crisis emerge as well,” Oquist said.
