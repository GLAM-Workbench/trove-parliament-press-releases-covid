GOVERNMENT MAKES FRONTLINE FAMILY VIOLENCE ORGANISATIONS  WAIT SIX MONTHS FOR EMERGENCY COVID-19 FUNDS



Yesterday the Morrison Government finally announced how it would allocate  the remaining more than half of the ‘initial’ $150 million in emergency funding it  promised in March to respond to the increase in family violence during the  COVID-19 pandemic.

In March, the Prime Minister announced some ‘initial’ extra funding for the  prevention of violence against women and their children before turning around  and deciding that only half would be made available immediately.

It has taken the Morrison Government almost another six months to allocate the  remainder of these ‘initial’ funds to the states on a per capita basis.

The Government should have made this decision in March.

This money could have placed more beds in refuges, funded more perpetrator  interventions, and provided more counselling for victim-survivors. Instead the  Morrison Government  sat on it for almost six months.

The Government’s delay has hurt front line service providers’ ability to respond  to the surge in family and domestic violence.



Service providers and those unable to access timely services deserve better  from the Morrison Government.
