MONDAY, 8 FEBRUARY 2021



SUBJECTS: Visit to Cairns; Cairns tourism industry; Regional Jobs Taskforce;

JobKeeper; COVID-19 affecting tourism sector.



DAVE, HOST: Good morning, Dave and Inkie for breakfast on a Monday. Look who's just

walked in the studio, Leader of the Opposition, Mr Anthony Albanese. Good morning, Albo.



ANTHONY ALBANESE, LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY: Just passing.

Thought I would drop in.

DAVE: We love when you just drop in. What brings you to Cairns?

ALBANESE: Well, I'm launching a Regional Jobs Taskforce today, talking about the need to

get jobs going after the pandemic. And I've been meeting with the tourism sector who are

doing it really tough. They really do need an extension of JobKeeper here for the tourism

sector.



DAVE: And you're obviously in favour of extending JobKeeper, which, I think, ends in March?

ALBANESE: It ends in March. And it just drops off a cliff. And all the conditions are still there

for why JobKeeper was important. The revenue is down. I met with the tourism operators

yesterday and we walked out on the jetty. You can see the tourist boats still there all on the

jetty. And a few years ago, I've been to Cairns many times and had the privilege of going out

on the reef, of course, many times as well. It was quite sad to see them there. That is basically

jobs sitting there not moving.



DAVE: And as well with Port Douglas, there are still a lot of places that aren't open at the

moment up there. And we do know, obviously, the big tour operators are struggling at the

moment. So, I mean, it would be great if we could extend JobKeeper here in Far North

Queensland for our tourism industry.



INKIE, HOST: Absolutely. I do love that you've come basically on the hottest weekend that

we've had for a very long time.



ALBANESE: I'm claiming credit. Skyrail yesterday, we were up there. It was quite cool when

you're under the canopy. But when you're out and about it can get a bit warm.



INKIE: Especially coming from Canberra. What is Canberra at these days?

ALBANESE: Canberra was pretty cold last week. It was wet. Although, of course, when you

stuck in Parliament House, the temperature is the same. People ask you, 'What's it like

outside?' I don't know.



DAVE: You've been stuck inside for six days.

ALBANESE: I don't know.

DAVE: Well, Albo, I know you got to keep moving. Thanks very much for popping in and

having a quick yarn with us here on Star.



ALBANESE: Cheers. Good to chat.
