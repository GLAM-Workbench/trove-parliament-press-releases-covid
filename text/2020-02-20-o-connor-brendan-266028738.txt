UNDEREMPLOYMENT HITS RECORD HIGH

Today’s labour force figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reveal a  record high number of underemployed Australians.

In another reminder of the structural issues in the labour market, 1.2 million Australians are  looking for more work but unable to find it. Since Scott Morrison became Prime Minister  there are nearly 90,000 extra underemployed people.

Almost 2 million Australians are underutilised, that is, looking for work or for more work  because the economy is floundering on the Liberals' watch.

Labor has been highlighting the issue of underemployment and calling on the Government  to take action for more than five years. Since this third term Government was elected,  nearly 280,000 more Australians are underemployed.

The underemployment rate at 8.6 per cent and the underutilisation rate at 13.9 per cent for  the month of January is far too high.

Under the Morrison Liberal Government, serious structural issues in the labour market  continue to generate insecure work and low wages growth.

Like much of the Australian economy, the labour market was weak long before the  bushfires hit or anyone had heard of Coronavirus and the Holden closure.
