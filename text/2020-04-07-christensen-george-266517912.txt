CO-CHAIRS - BRING JULIAN ASSANGE HOME PARLIAMENTARY GROUP





MEDIA STATEMENT

Request for Assange release on compassionate grounds

As Co-Chairs of the Bring Julian Assange Home Parliamentary Group, overnight we have issued an  urgent request for the release of Mr Assange from Belmarsh Prison on compassionate grounds.

We understand that the UK Justice Committee will hear from the Secretary of State for Justice on  Tuesday in relation to early release of low risk prisoners in light of the COVID-19 outbreak.

We have written to the British Lord Chancellor & Secretary of State for Justice the Rt Hon Robert  Buckland MP, as well as the chair of the UK Commons Justice Committee the Hon Bob Neill MP,  asking that Mr Assange be released into 24-hour monitored home detention because he fits all of the  grounds noted for early release by organisations such as the World Health Organisation, the United  Nations and the UK Prison Officers Association.

We have noted the following:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Mr Assange is a non-violent remand prisoner with no history of harm to the community. He  is not convicted and is thus entitled to the presumption of innocence.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Doctors of Mr Assange warn he is at high risk from dying if he contracts COVID-19 as he  has a pre-existing chronic lung condition.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We are advised that COVID-19 is rapidly spreading throughout UK prisons and there are

infections at Belmarsh Prison.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We understand that the prison is short-staffed and normal activity regimes are suspended.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Mr Assange is in poor mental health due to spending much time in solitary confinement over

recent years, and prison COVID-19 lockdown measures are further exacerbating his mental  health.

There are concerning reports about the incidence of COVID-19 in British prisons, including  Belmarsh, and it is widely acknowledged that prisons are a high-risk environment for disease spread.

We ask that our UK Parliamentary counterparts act with compassion and give further consideration  to the very reasonable request from Mr Assange’s lawyers that this non-violent Australian prisoner  be released into home detention with a 24-hour ankle monitor.
