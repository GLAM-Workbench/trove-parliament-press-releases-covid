Communique

Education Council met today by teleconference to discuss early childhood education and  care services provision in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ministers acknowledged the announcements made by the Australian Government earlier  in the day regarding funding assistance to allow families to continue to access early  childhood education and care services, and extending preschool funding arrangements to  2021.

Ministers agreed that early childhood education and care services will remain open for all  families who require care and any future decisions regarding these services will be  consistent with advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC).

Education Council noted that state and territory regulatory authorities have agreed four  critical areas for time-limited regulatory action: waiving fees and charges for COVID19-related applications, fast-tracking qualification waivers, suspending assessment and  ratings, and making rapid operational adjustments as required. Regulatory Authorities will  continue to apply child safety as the primary consideration in regulatory decisions.  Ministers noted that fast-tracking qualification and operational requirement waivers is  subject to there being no increased risk to the safety of children and staff.

Education Ministers are seeking further advice and practice guidance from the AHPPC on  safe early childhood education and care practice, especially relating to room size  limitations and additional cleaning, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ministers requested that senior officials continue to work together to ensure an effective  and streamlined early childhood education and care services response to COVID-19 and  report back to Education Council regularly.
