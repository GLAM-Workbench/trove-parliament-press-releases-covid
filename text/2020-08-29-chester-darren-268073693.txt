LEGACY WEEK - SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS’ FAMILIES

THIS coming week is Legacy Week, an annual appeal that raises awareness and funds to support the  families of Australian veterans.

Minister for Veterans’ Affairs Darren Chester said Legacy Week was known for its trademark badges  and was a simple way that Australians can support our ex-service personnel and their families, and  say ‘thank you’.

“Every year since 1942, Legacy volunteers have fundraised across Australia for the families of  veterans who stand by our service men and women both during and after their service,” Mr Chester  said.

"This year has been unprecedented in so many ways, and the coronavirus crisis has heightened  many of the pressures that our veterans and their families are experiencing.

“That is why it is more important than ever that we all do what we can to help organisations like  Legacy support the families of veterans and I encourage Australians to consider buying a badge or  supporting Legacy online.”

This month has also seen the appointment of Gwen Cherne as the first ever Veteran Family  Advocate, ensuring veterans’ families’ perspectives are represented and at the forefront of policy  and decision making across Government.

“Legacy supports the families of veterans who have fallen, or whose health has suffered as a result  of their service. They helped my family in our darkest of times with financial and social support,” Ms  Cherne said.

“Legacy Week is about ensuring continued services are available for the 52,000 veterans’ families  that Legacy supports across Australia.

“Legacy has a strong history of commitment to Australian military families, so buy a badge, donate  or consider becoming a volunteer for this great organisation.”

Due to coronavirus pandemic, unfortunately this year many of the normal fundraising events that  Legacy run during Legacy Week will not be able to go ahead as they normally would. This is to  protect the health and safety of the participants and Legacy volunteers.

Badge Day is Friday, 4 September (Thursday, 3 September in Western Australia) and donations can  be made at the Legacy Week website, www.legacyweek.com.au. Legacy merchandise, including their
