ANOTHER CAPEX COLLAPSE



New data showing capital expenditure has collapsed again absolutely destroys Josh

Frydenberg’s claim that the economy was performing strongly before the Coronavirus

outbreak hit.



In a week when the Prime Minister said that Australia will need to “depend a lot more on its

domestic elements” it is absurd that the Morrison Government still lacks a plan to address

falling business investment in the floundering economy.



Private new capital expenditure plunged by 2.8 per cent in the December quarter, well

below market expectations, to be 5.8 per cent lower over the past year.



Capital expenditure is more than 30 per cent lower than when the Liberals first came to

office and business investment is around its lowest levels since the 1990s recession.



This result follows yesterday’s news that construction work collapsed in the December

quarter, when the economy was already struggling from weak consumption, stagnant

wages, declining productivity and record high household and government debt.



Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg didn’t have a plan for the floundering economy last

year and they don’t have a plan now.



Today’s data is more evidence that the Australian economy was deteriorating long before

the Coronavirus outbreak.



It’s long past time for the Prime Minister and Treasurer to join with Labor, the Reserve

Bank and the business community and bring forward a plan to address our long-standing

domestic economic challenges and get businesses investing again.



Because of the Morrison Government’s inaction, Australia meets the serious challenges

and uncertainties of the fire season and the Coronavirus outbreak from a position of

weakness, not strength.
