MORRISON GOVERNMENT’S AGED CARE SECRECY MUST END

The Morrison Government must end its aged care secrecy after revelations the names of  75 nursing homes that failed standards relating to COVID preparedness have been kept  hidden.

The 75 nursing homes were among more than 100 across the country that failed standards  on preparing for COVID-19.

This latest concerning report follows an extraordinary exchange at the Select Committee  on COVID-19 when the Morrison Government refused to disclose nursing homes in  Victoria with outbreaks.

It is shocking the Morrison Government and its aged care regulator are not prepared to be  honest with older Australians and their families at this time of crisis.

Labor has been saying for a long time there needs to be more transparency around the  reporting of failures in nursing homes so older Australians and their loved ones know what  is happening.

We know how devastating COVID-19 has been in nursing homes so it is just not good  enough that failures relating to outbreak preparedness have been kept hidden.

Families, loved ones and residents deserve full transparency and to know if a nursing  home is safe.

We have seen the devastating impact of COVID-19 outbreaks in aged care in Australia  and across the globe.

Why was the Morrison Government not better prepared for outbreaks that would impact  our nation’s most vulnerable? Why are they not more honest with older Australians?

Australia’s aged care system was broken before the COVID-19 pandemic and this is only  putting extra stress on the system.

The Morrison Government must do better for our most vulnerable older Australians.



The Morrison Government must learn from the past few months and act to prevent further  outbreaks in the aged care system.
