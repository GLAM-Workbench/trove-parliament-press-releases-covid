GOVERNMENT ABANDONS WOMEN ON TEMPORARY VISAS FACING

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE



We have known for some time that people on temporary visas in Australia who are

experiencing domestic violence have insufficient access to services and support.



The revelations on ABC’s 7.30 last night show just how bad this situation has become

during the COVID-19 pandemic.



Temporary visa holders are ineligible for many government support payments and health

benefits. This sees women and their children fleeing violence  struggle to get the support

they need from shelters, clinics, housing and support services which are simply not funded

to help them.



Women and children are also severely limited in their options by Coronavirus travel

restrictions - unable to escape or access support networks.



Perpetrators have leveraged the travel restrictions, isolation and lack of specifically funded

services to exert extraordinary control  over their victims.



Women and children on temporary visas are being left desperate and destitute. There



should be no place for this in Australia.



Yesterday, officials from the Office for Women told the Senate Select Committee on

COVID-19 that this issue was “a priority” for the Minister for Women.  The Government’s

actions do not reflect this statement.



The Australian Law Reform Commission, Victorian Royal Commission and frontline service

providers have all been calling for action.



The Minister for Families and Social Services could fix many of the problems faced by

women on temporary visas with the stroke of a pen.



The Morrison Government has chosen not to act.
