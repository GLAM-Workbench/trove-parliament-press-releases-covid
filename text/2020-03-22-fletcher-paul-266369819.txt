The Cultural and Creative Sector and COVID-19

Measures announced today by the Prime Minister and Treasurer under the government’s $66 billion  COVID-19 package will be very important in supporting workers and organisations in the cultural and  creative sector, said Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher  MP.

Many casuals and sole traders in the cultural and creative sector face a loss of income for a significant  period. They will benefit from the income support measures announced today.

The Government has temporarily waived the asset test and waiting periods for the Jobseeker  allowance, while a new, time-limited Coronavirus supplement will be paid at a rate of $550 per  fortnight to both existing and new recipients. This effectively doubles the current JobSeeker  allowance.

Small and medium sized arts organisations such as theatre companies, aboriginal art centres, small  venues and many others may be able to draw on business support measures announced today.

The Government is providing payments of up to $100,000 to eligible small and medium sized  businesses, and not-for-profits (including charities) that employ people, with a minimum payment of  $20,000. These payments will provide cash flow support to help eligible businesses and not-for-profits  keep operating and retain staff. This includes creative and cultural businesses and not-for-profits.

A loan guarantee scheme will also support small to medium-sized businesses. There are no charges for  accessing the scheme, and it will be repayment-free for six months. The maximum loan is $250,000,  for a term of up to three years. Creative and cultural businesses are eligible to apply. This  complements $8 billion in measures announced by Australian banks last week to support small  business by deferring small business loan repayments for six months.

In addition to these economy wide measures, both the Australia Council and the Office for the Arts  have been given discretion under Commonwealth Grant Rules to provide reporting and other grant  condition relief to organisations with existing Australian Government funding arrangements. These  include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Removing requirements on meeting audience KPIs  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Bringing forward payments  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Delaying or removing reporting requirements

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Varying the purposes and outcomes of funding  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Extending timelines for projects  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Allowing organisations to use money provided for a deliverable to be repurposed to pay  essential bills such as wages, rent or utilities.

Organisations are encouraged to speak with their program officer about options that can provide  flexible support during these difficult times. Information is available at www.arts.gov.au/funding-and-support.

“The cultural and creative sector plays a vital part in our economy, contributing $112 billion - just  over 6 per cent to our Gross Domestic Product every year. Over 800,000 people work in cultural and  creative occupations,” Minister Fletcher said.

“By acting now, the Government is helping businesses to remain solvent, protecting jobs and  Australia’s rich creative and cultural sector during these difficult circumstances.”

From Tuesday 24 March, the Office for the Arts and Australia Council will begin a weekly COVID-19  Support workshop with sixteen peak arts bodies. This week, representatives from the COVID-19  Business Liaison Unit, the Australian Banking Association and the Department of Social Services will  provide information on support available for creative and cultural organisations and their people.

Creative and cultural organisations wishing to raise concerns or seeking further information can get in  touch with the Office for Arts by emailing COVID-19@arts.gov.au. A dedicated 1800 number will be  released in coming days.

Members of the creative and cultural sector can also visit the Office for the Arts website for further  information and links to relevant Government announcements: https://www.arts.gov.au/covid-19-update.
