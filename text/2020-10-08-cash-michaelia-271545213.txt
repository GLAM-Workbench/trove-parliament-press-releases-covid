TAILORED CAREERS SUPPORT FOR SCHOOL LEAVERS

A new targeted support package for young people is helping to tackle the uncertainty around  leaving school and choosing the right career pathway.

The National Careers Institute (NCI) has launched the School Leavers Information Kit and  the School Leavers Information Service.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said these initiatives provide invaluable support and assistance for school leavers.

“Australian school students in Years 10, 11 and 12 have shown unwavering resilience in the  face of COVID-19 and they deserve the best possible support as they consider their next  steps,” Minister Cash said.

“These initiatives will help young people finishing school to find the education, training and  employment options that best suit them, now and into the future.

The Australian Government has invested $13.8 million in the Enhanced Support for School  Leavers measure.

Assistant Minister for Vocational Education, Training and Apprenticeships, the Hon Steve  Irons MP, said the online kit and the information service complement the recently launched  Australian Government careers website, Your Career.

“I am pleased that these initiatives are available at such an important time to support our  school leavers in taking their next step towards pursuing their career pathway in 2021,”  Assistant Minister Irons said.

The School Leavers Information Kit Your Career: What’s next for you? is available on the  Your Career website at YourCareer.gov.au.
