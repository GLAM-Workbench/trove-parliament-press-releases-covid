UPDATE ON CORONAVIRUS MEASURES



Australian governments are working together to slow the spread of coronavirus to save lives.

Every extra bit of time allows us to better prepare our health system and put measures in place to  protect Australian lives.

We will be living with this virus for at least six months, so social distancing measures to slow this virus  down must be sustainable for at least that long to protect Australian lives, allow Australia to keep  functioning and keep Australians in jobs.

The Prime Minister, state and territory Premiers and Chief Ministers met on 24 March 2020 as the  National Cabinet.

We are leading the world on testing with more than 161,000 Australians tested and around 2,000  Australians confirmed cases. In contrast to many countries, the majority of Australian cases of  coronavirus have been from people returning overseas or direct contacts with people who had been  overseas.

However, National Cabinet noted that there has been a significant growth in the number of cases in  Australia, with a significant number of Australians returning from overseas and small community  outbreaks associated with returned travellers.

National Cabinet reiterated that practicing good hygiene and keeping a healthy physical distance  between individuals is our most powerful weapon in fighting this virus and saving lives.

The highest priority should be placed on social isolation measures as well as strict and rapid contact  tracing of individuals. It is paramount that contact tracing occur quickly and thoroughly and that public  data is available to support this effort.

Leaders again call on all Australian to do their bit to save the lives of other Australians.

Australians should stay at home, unless shopping for essentials, travelling to and from work - where you  cannot work from home, going to school and exercising. Keep visitors to your home at a minimum. In  outdoor spaces do not congregate in groups.

Leaders thank those members of the public who are adhering to social distancing measures. However,  leaders expressed their disappointment at some members of the community who are disregarding social  distancing measures and, by doing so, putting the lives of older and vulnerable Australians at risk.

Ban on Australians travelling overseas

Leaders noted that the Commonwealth Government will implement a ‘do not travel’ ban on Australians  travelling overseas under the Biosecurity Act 2015.

This will help avoid travellers returning to Australia with coronavirus and the risks of spreading  coronavirus to other countries.

Exemptions, which will be managed by the Australian Border Force, will apply to a range of categories of  travellers, including for those citizens ordinarily resident overseas, where travel is essential or necessary,  where travel is in our national interest, and on compassionate and humanitarian grounds.

This prohibition is aligned with the Government’s decision to raise the Smartraveller Travel Advice to  Level 4 - Do Not Travel overseas.

Clarification of current measures and new measures

If we want to slow the spread of the virus, everyone must implement appropriate social distancing in  accordance with state and territory laws.

National Cabinet agreed to new and enhanced social distance measures, building on the existing  measures that are in place.

National Cabinet confirmed and clarified the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC)  advice regarding the requirements of previously announced measures, in particular those related to  non-essential gatherings and outdoor gatherings.

National Cabinet will meet again on Wednesday 25 March 2020.

Action to prevent price gouging and exportation of critical sanitary and medical products

The Commonwealth Government will take action to help prevent exploitative price gouging and  exporting products that are essential to preventing and controlling the spread of coronavirus.

These measures will help prevent individuals purchasing goods including face masks, hand sanitiser and  vital medicines and either re-selling them at significant mark-ups or exporting them overseas in bulk,  which prevents these goods from reaching people who need them in Australia.

These measures will not be designed to affect normal consumer buying of goods, commercial imports  and exports, or other appropriate bulk sales.
