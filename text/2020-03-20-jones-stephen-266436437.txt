WELCOME RELIEF FOR BORROWERS AND SMALL BUSINESS

Labor welcomes today’s announcement by Australian banks that they will provide much  needed relief for borrowers and small business during this challenging time.

Labor also welcomes moves by some banks to support households with home loan  repayment deferrals and calls on other lenders to do what they can to assist Australians as  the impact of this virus outbreak continues to worsen.

The Government needs to immediately develop and implement a plan to ensure that  people who rent don’t get kicked out onto the street because of the virus.

Coronavirus is having a substantial economic impact and there is already evidence that  businesses are closing, that workers are already being laid off and that vulnerable  Australians are at serious risk.

No one should lose their home or their businesses because they are affected by the virus.

These extraordinary economic challenges require extraordinary economic responses, and



every decision maker in the economy has a role to play.

While these steps are welcome, more needs to be done to support the economy and  protect Australian households and businesses that are already under immense pressure.

Each day, it becomes clearer that the first stimulus package was insufficient.

We need urgent action to ensure that families, workers, business and communities are  protected.

The Morrison Government needs to better ensure its policy response to Coronavirus is  coordinated across government, including better coordination of its health and economic  measures.

Labor’s priority is to protect jobs, help Australian workers, businesses, families and  communities through this difficult time, and ensure vulnerable Australians are supported.

Labor will continue to be supportive, responsible and constructive and that means injecting  a sense of urgency where it is lacking or absent.
