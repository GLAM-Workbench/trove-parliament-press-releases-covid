SHADOW MINISTER FOR INFRASTRUCTURE, TRANSPORT AND  REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT  MEMBER FOR BALLARAT

GOVERNMENT MUST GUARANTEE AIRPORT FIREFIGHTING

As the COVID-crisis continues to ravage the aviation sector, the Morrison  Government must urgently guarantee that Aviation Rescue Fire Fighting  Services (ARFFS) capabilities and workersâ€™ jobs are protected through this  crisis and into the future.

ARFFS is embedded within Air Services Australia, a government-owned  corporation normally funded through fees and charges applied to airline  services.

With airlines grounded, income received by Air Services Australia has  plummeted.

Despite reductions in flights, ARFFS crews are still required to work around the  clock ensuring that parked aircraft and significant fuel stores are kept safe.

The Morrison Government provided some additional funding to Air Services  Australia earlier in the pandemic, but assurances are needed regarding  ongoing support.

Australia will need our airports and aviation sector to respond quickly as travel  restrictions are eased and services resume.  To ensure that airports, parked  aircraft and fuel supplies are kept safe, funding for fire fighting capability must  be maintained by the Government to ensure rapid response to any unforeseen  incident on an airport.

Labor has written to the Deputy Prime Minister seeking these assurances.
