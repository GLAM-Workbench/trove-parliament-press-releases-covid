STILL NO AVIATION PLAN



Today’s announcement comes too late for thousands of Australian families and does too little

to support the future of Australian aviation.



A three month flight subsidy won’t make up for a year of government neglect throughout the

COVID pandemic.



Airlines, airports, unions and aviation businesses have spent the past 12 months calling on the

Morrison Government to come up with a long-term plan for Australian aviation.



Instead of acting, the Morrison Government has denied support to airports, denied JobKeeper

to Dnata workers, allowed Virgin Australia to fall into administration and stood by as Qantas

sacked 8,500 workers.



Because of these failures, the Morrison Government has overseen the loss of over 10,000 jobs

at our major carriers.



It’s obvious that the aviation sector will still need strong support beyond the flight subsidy

scheme’s end in July and that international travel will not return to normal by October.



This scheme is no substitute for JobKeeper and the long-term plan for aviation which will be

crucial to our long-term economic prosperity.
