DAN WINSON



I'm incredibly excited to receive support from the Federal Government to get this venture going.  Zetifi has been working really hard for the last couple of years to provide alternative connectivity  solutions for farmers and for people in rural and remote locations. And this funding is going to allow  us to scale up our operations and get to market in Australia and then globally. Zetifi is a  manufacturing company building wireless connectivity solutions to people in rural and remote  locations. We're focused on taking care of that 1% of people that live in areas where Telstra, Optus  and other carriers just can't feasibly get to. So we're building new technology that enables long  range Wi-Fi connectivity so that people can have Wi-Fi calling. So they can have internet out in the  paddock. And so I can have wireless cameras and tractors that are fully connected, so that you can  make use of the latest innovative ad tech technology. Connectivity’s absolutely critical for people in  the bush, they need it not just for the profitability of their businesses, they need it so that they can  be safer. They made it so they can have the same quality of life that people in the city have. And  with the COVID pandemic connectivity is more important than ever, all of us have had to do Zoom  meetings, all of us have had to, yeah, take care of kids at home that need connectivity to be  schooled Without reliable and fast connectivity that's just not possible. Our technology is solving  that for people in rural and remote locations.

JOURNALIST

Do you have any idea how many farms you have already helped get them to the network and how  many of those might [inaudible] -





DAN WINSON



Yes, absolutely. So when we're selling Australia-wide. Zetifi is looking to scale this company globally.  So we're not just focused on the Riverina, we are focused on building it in the Riverina and we’re  focused on getting it out to the world. But with early adopters, we’ve connected more than 100  locations so far and we're looking to increase that ten-fold within the next 12 months.

JOURNALIST

What about the affordability, obviously, there's a lot of farmers that have been through some  difficult times, is this going to be achievable for the average farmer?

DAN WINSON



Absolutely, affordability is definitely critical to make this work for agriculture. There's great  technology out there for mining and resources already, but it's not suitable for agriculture. We've  built this technology with farmers in mind and the cost is significantly lower than anything that was  around previously.

JOURNALIST

What are the costs and what are the ongoing costs, Dan?

DAN WINSON



Absolutely. So a typical farms investing between five and $10,000 and then with an ongoing cost of  hundreds of dollars per year, providing them with reliable connectivity where they need it.

JOURNALIST

You mentioned building it here, is the plan to keep building it here as you scale up, as you said?

DAN WINSON



Yes, we'd like to see manufacturing back in Australia and manufacturing in regional areas in  Australia. And we think that we can deliver enough value through these products to do that here in  Wagga.

JOURNALIST

DAN WINSON



So 18 months ago we had me, 12 months ago there were three of us and currently they’re ten  employees and we're looking to double that within the next 12 months so that we can take this  technology out to market and then as we get to market, the sky's the limit.

MICHAEL McCORMACK



Great compliments to Dan Winson and his dedicated team at Zetifi here today. Yes, they are taking  advantage of a $644,000 federal funding initiative to accelerate their commercialisation. To  accelerate what they are doing for and on behalf of farmers across this nation, they are going to  connect them to the world, the NBN, its reach is very broad across the length and breadth of the  nation. But what Dan Winson and his team are going to be doing here out of the Riedell Street  factory is that they are going to be connecting them to the world, they're going to be filling in the  gaps. They're going to be in the making sure that where there isn't connectivity, that they provide  that gap, that they fill that gap, that they make sure that they are connected. And of course, we  know with farmers these days when they're on their tractor, whether it's a New Holland or a Case  and that's the arrangements that Zetifi have made, have put into place so that those farmers can be  selling their grain, selling their stock whilst they're still on the tractor. Whilst they're in their  paddocks in very remote locations in Australia. They can be connected to the internet, they can be  connected to mobile through solar panels through Zetifi. Connection awaits for those farmers. I  congratulate Dan and his team, I congratulate the entrepreneurial spirit. Small business makes this  country what it is today. And of course, with this federal funding, this is just going to ensure that  Zetifi can expand their operations out of Wagga Wagga, right across the nation indeed, right across  the world. There's nothing to stop the spirit of Dan Winson and his team to be able to do just that.  And it's going to be so important as we go forward and as connection is so important for farmers, as  we make more trade arrangements with more countries in the world, we know how important trade  is. Australia is a trading nation, we've got the very best food and fibre in all of the world. And what  Zetifi is going to do is going to connect those farmers to their market opportunities, those farmers  with the rest of the world. So well done Dan, well done Zetifi. I look forward to seeing this only  progress into much bigger and better things in the future.

JOURNALIST

A senior Liberal Minister has called John Barilaro’s leadership untenable. Does Mr Barilaro -

MICHAEL McCORMACK



One thing I will say about John Barilaro, he puts his name to those things he says, those things he  texts. If senior Liberals want to come out and make statements put their names to it.









JOURNALIST

Yesterday, the Premier wouldn't even say Mr Barilaro’s name. Do you think that the Liberals will  want to work with Mr Barilaro?

MICHAEL McCORMACK



Well, what we need right at the moment with this COVID pandemic is good government and the  New South Wales Government is providing just that. Yes, there are side issues, there are side  distractions, but what we need - people are anxious, people are worried about their health, they are  worried about the jobs. That's what I'm focused on. I'm sure that's what other members of all  governments should be focused on and that is getting that right delivery for people who are very  worried at this point in time. Yes, these sorts of issues about farmers’ rights and koalas are  important, I understand that. But what's really important now is that these issues are resolved  behind closed doors, resolved through the Cabinet process, as has been agreed and let's get on with  making sure that we're addressing the real issues in Australia. And that is the health outcomes, that  is getting a vaccine and that is ensuring that people have jobs and a good future going forward.

JOURNALIST

Do you support Mr Barilaro?

MICHAEL McCORMACK



Yes.

JOURNALIST

Why?

MICHAEL McCORMACK



Well, he's the leader of the New South Wales National Party. He's been properly and democratically  elected by the members of his party. And if you look at John's record as far as delivering for regional  New South Wales, it's very good. Fact is, when the New South Wales Government sold the Snowy  Hydro arrangement to the federal government, more than $4 billion of that money through John  Barilaro’s negotiations, came to region New South Wales, came west of The Great Divide. That  wasn't just money for the areas of Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong. That was money for country  centres and that was arranged by John Barilaro through the New South Wales Nationals and I can  see right throughout the Wagga Wagga electorate, right throughout the Cootamundra electorate,  right throughout indeed the Orange electorate. And they are the state electorates which form part  of the Riverina federal electorate that I represent. How that money has gone to making sure that  there is better infrastructure right across this region. Regional people need better infrastructure.





Regional people need better services and that's what the New South Wales Nationals, indeed  working with the federal Nationals, are providing.

JOURNALIST

[Inaudible]

MICHAEL McCORMACK



Well no, look, I get on very well with Scott Morrison I speak to him every morning. In fact, I was a  little bit late here this morning because I was on the phone to Scott Morrison talking about the  things that matter right across the nation, talking about whether we're going to be able to have  agricultural workers coming across the border, talking about transport issues, talking about fuel  security, we're making some good announcements today as far as fuel security is concerned $200  million to ensure that we extend the amount of time that we've got and the amount of fuel we've  got in store for our fuel reserves. I was talking to him about the fact that just today I'm about to  address the Murray Darling Association and make announcements around the National Water Grid  Authority. An Authority that actually includes a Riverina person in Elizabeth Stott from Gogeldrie  near Whitton, so that's important that we are talking about the things that matter. Everything that I  and Scott Morrison talk about are things that, again, do impact on people's health, do impact on  people's livelihoods, impact on people’s jobs and we’re making sure that they've got security in all of  those areas, just mentioned. We’re making sure that they know that the federal government and,  indeed, the New South Wales Government has their back.

JOURNALIST

But no ramifications whatsoever for what's happening?

MICHAEL McCORMACK



It's a state issue. It's going to be resolved at the state level where it should be.

JOURNALIST

You said good government was key, is that going to be taking place if the Liberals won’t talk to The  Nationals?

MICHAEL McCORMACK



Look, I'm sure there's a bit of posturing going on in the media. The important thing is they get it  behind closed doors, they’ll sort this SEPP issue out where they sort this State Environmental  Planning Policy out. It is a shame they couldn't have done it a few weeks ago, if not months ago.  Move on and make sure that New South Wales people know they have their backs. I'm sure that





New South Wales indeed, the biggest issues in the state at the moment are not koalas, they are in  fact, the pandemic. I think Gladys Berejiklian and John Barilaro have done a very good job in that  regard. The New South Wales Government has led the way as far as making sure that hotel  quarantine is what it needs to be insofar as they've ensured that most people who are returning  Australians have been able to quarantine in Sydney. They’ve provided that service. We've kept the  case rates here very low. You know, you look at the New South Wales record and compare it to any  other state or province in any other country in the world. It's pretty good. Yes, it’s sad that we've lost  so many. It’s sad and unfortunate that there have been a number of coronavirus cases. But this is a  global pandemic. We're dealing with it very much at a local state and federal level - we've done very  well so far.

JOURNALIST

[Inaudible]

MICHAEL McCORMACK



I speak to John quite regularly, he's got Parliament tomorrow. He's very busy as am I. As I say, we  speak to each other very regularly. But at the moment, I'm dealing with federal as the constituents  of the Riverina would expect me to.

JOURNALIST

[Inaudible]



MICHAEL McCORMACK



Look, we have extended the visa arrangements to ensure that fruit pickers who are in Australia, of  course, can stay longer. And we're certainly doing everything that we can to ensure that the State  Premiers realise the value of - whether it's fruit pickers, whether it's abattoir workers, whether it's  in the shearers that they can travel across borders. We need to be able to pick the fruit, harvest the  crops, process the stock that we have always done in the past. These are difficult issues. I appreciate  that state borders are, you know, those restrictions need to be eased as soon as possible. At the  moment I believe they are just there for political means not a health means, that's unfortunate.  What we need to be able to ensure that does happen is that the fruit doesn't get wasted, doesn't get  left to rot on the ground, it needs to be picked. I only spoke to Tom Eastlake of Young the other day,  he’s very worried about the number of workers that they will need in six weeks time when the  cherries come in to harvest and need to be picked. Of course, the very best cherries in all of the  world come out of the Young district and we want to make sure that they get picked. We want to  make sure that they get picked when they’re ripe. And I'm working very hard with David Littleproud  the Agriculture Minister and others to ensure that happens.







JOURNALIST

Mr McCormack, I believe you've made representations about organising or trying to organise travel  bubbles with other countries overseas to address those rural workforce shortages - what movement  have you made -

MICHAEL McCORMACK



Negotiations are underway. I've had some very good and productive discussions. And as I always do,  I'll make sure that those discussions come off before I go public on it. That’s the way that it needs to  happen. I don't want to jeopardise anything that is in train. We want to make sure that we get those  workers to Australia, we certainly got a good Pacific Island step up campaign where many, many  workers have still been able to come into this country and to be able to do all the great jobs that  they've always done in the past.

JOURNALIST

Is that solution likely to be in place, say before grain harvesting season?

MICHAEL McCORMACK



Well, let's certainly hope so because, as I said before, the Riverina and Australia grows the very best  food and fibre in all the world. We need it to be harvested. We need it to be picked. We need stock  to be processed. We need that to continue. State border closures do not help that, of course  international arrivals, it’s difficult because we need to be able to quarantine those people for 14  days - any arrival whether they're returning Australians or whether they are, in fact, foreigners. We  need to be able to quarantine them and it is a bit difficult at the moment when we've got  restrictions in place at airports, restrictions in place indeed, in states - particularly Victoria, Western  Australia and Queensland - and it makes it very, very difficult when we're trying to get workers in,  when we're trying to get Australians home. We are working day and night, dealing with some very  heart-wrenching issues with people wanting to return home and indeed, with people wanting to  leave Australia with limited flights to be able to see loved ones in some cases where their parents  are old or ill. Also many Australians, whose children are overseas and you know, they're suffering  mentally. That's why I'm pleased that, you know, we have put in place measures to address mental  health issues here at home. These are very difficult times for so many Australians, so many  Australians are nervous and anxious about their futures. But the National Cabinet process has  worked well so far. And I can assure you every federal Minister is working around the clock to make  sure that they're dealing with the issues in their own individual respective portfolios.
