ADF ESTABLISHES OPERATION NSW FLOOD ASSIST

The Australian Defence Force (ADF) will today establish Operation NSW FLOOD ASSIST  21-1 as part of the Federal Government’s response to the NSW flood emergency.

The ADF is supporting the NSW Government-led efforts with aerial search and rescue  support, civilian evacuation operations, and preparing forces to assist in recovery  operations.

The ADF is initially deploying almost 300 ADF personnel to support this operation,  expanding to around 700 personnel in the coming days. This will include around 400 from  Queensland.

Under the new Operation, ADF rotary wing aircraft will deploy from Sydney and Townsville  on Thursday 25 March, including three Army MRH-90 helicopters, to supplement the two  ADF helicopters from HMAS Albatross currently complementing state search and rescue  capabilities.

The Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management, David Littleproud said  that this defence assistance will be crucial in complementing the great work of NSW’s first  responders and aiding in recovery efforts on the ground.

“Our men and women of the ADF have expertise and assets which will aid NSW in search  and rescue efforts.

“When the immediate crisis has subsided, ADF capabilities and muscle will be key in  helping communities recover.

“We are proud to be able to support NSW in this way.”

The Acting Minister for Defence, Senator the Hon Marise Payne said the Government  stands with New South Wales during these challenging times.

“Our thoughts are with those who have been impacted by these devastating floods in New  South Wales,” Minister Payne said.

“Substantial ADF capabilities are now preparing to join this operation over the coming  days, expanding on the support that commenced on Tuesday.

“When the flood waters subside, the Army Emergency Support Force will be able to assist  with tasks such as clearing debris, sandbagging, clean-up duties and helping restore  essential services such as electricity and water.

“Once again our ADF personnel have stepped-up in Australia’s time of need, just like they  did during the Black Summer bushfires and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Yesterday, RAAF Base Richmond commenced supporting the Rural Fire Service and  State Emergency Service to evacuate residents from the Colo River region.

This support included:   Ã¯ÂÂ· providing civilian aircraft with access to RAAF Base Richmond;  Ã¯ÂÂ· air traffic control, aircraft handling and refuelling services; and  Ã¯ÂÂ· escorting evacuees to evacuation centres.



This support of RAAF Richmond personnel enabled the safe evacuation of anyone  requiring immediate medical treatment, such as dialysis, over four separate flights.
