EXPLOSIVE NEW EVIDENCE REVEALS HUNDREDS OF AGED CARE

PROVIDERS DENIED ACCESS TO PPE



Explosive new evidence has revealed the Morrison Government rejected more than 1,500

requests for PPE from aged care providers at the height of the COVID-19 crisis.



This included knocking back hundreds of requests from Victorian aged care providers

wanting PPE in July and August when COVID-19 tore through nursing homes in the state.



Answers provided to the Senate show that of 2865 PPE requests from aged care providers

to access the National Medical Stockpile, just 1324 were approved.



The Aged Care Royal Commissioners recently described PPE shortages in aged care as

‘deplorable’.



“Insufficient supplies of PPE and infection control training for the aged care workforce were

the subject of evidence in the form of union surveys and accounts. We heard of workers

being told they could only use one glove rather than two, and a guideline at a residential

aged care facility that only permitted two masks per shift. This is deplorable.”



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ AGED CARE ROYAL COMMISSION, AGED CARE AND COVID-19: A SPECIAL

REPORT



Report after report has identified shortages of PPE as a key contributor to COVID-19



outbreaks in aged care but in response the Morrison Government shut the door on

providers.



The Morrison Government’s rationing of PPE, as hundreds of older Australians died of

COVID-19, is beyond belief.



While Australia’s heroic aged care workers were doing everything they could to protect

older Australians from COVID-19, the Morrison Government was busy short-changing

them.



The Morrison Government needs to immediately explain why so many providers asked for

PPE but didn’t get it.



The Aged Care Royal Commission’s special report on COVID-19 confirmed the Morrison

Government had no plan for aged care and this is yet more evidence of the Morrison

Government’s failures.



Day after day the evidence mounts of serious neglect in aged care and every day all we

see from the Morrison Government is running away, passing the buck and not accepting

responsibility for its own failures.



Neglect. That’s the legacy of this Government when it comes to aged care.



Australians deserve better.
