Statement on child care



The current expert medical advice is that the child care sector should remain open except  where individual services have been directed to close by health authorities.

The Government is aware of the challenges facing the Child Care sector because of reduced  attendance.

I am working with the sector to minimise the impact of COVID-19, and we already have  implemented additional support arrangements.

To support the sector, we have increased the number of days, up to 62, that a child care  service will continue to receive the Child Care Subsidy (CCS) when a child is absent from  care. The CCS covers up to 85 per cent of the daily costs of a childâ€™s care.

Grants ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 are available for child care providers through the  Community Child Care Special Circumstances Fund to help cover business costs, including  wages, to ensure services impacted by COVID-19 can continue to operate.

Families with financial difficulty can apply for funding through the ACCS (temporary financial  hardship fund) to cover child care gap fees.

One of the key ways all governments can support the sector is through regulatory relief and  this is on the agenda for Education Council tomorrow.

We continue to assess the issues facing the sector and we will continue to work with them to  manage the impact of the coronavirus.

I will have more to say on this in the coming days.
