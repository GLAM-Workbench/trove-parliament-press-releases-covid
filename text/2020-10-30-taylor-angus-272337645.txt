ONGOING SUPPORT FOR ENERGY USERS DURING COVID-19

The Morrison Government and the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) are continuing to  ensure that support is provided to Australian households and small businesses  experiencing financial hardship because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In recognition of the significant impact the pandemic is having on the lives of all  Australians, the Government, through the AER, has set strong but reasonable  expectations of the support that energy companies must provide their customers.

First outlined in March and updated in July 2020, the Statement of  Expectations will now extend key consumer protections through to 31 March 2021 and  potentially beyond.

Key support measures the Government expects of energy companies include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continuing to offer all households and small businesses in financial stress a

payment plan or hardship arrangement.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Assisting customers to make existing payment plans sustainable, by re-calculating

debt obligations using a lower cost plan if available.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Waiving disconnection, re-connection and/or contract break fees, along with

daily supply charges for small businesses that have ceased operating.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Not disconnecting residential customers in financial distress that have made

contact with their retailer or responded to communications.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Not disconnecting small business customers that are adhering to a payment plan

or payment arrangement.

The AER will continue to monitor energy debt levels to ensure that the energy industry’s  response to the pandemic is delivering the right outcomes for customers.

Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said that it is vital that  households and businesses receive support to deal with the economic repercussions of  COVID-19.

“The Government recognises the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on Australian households  and businesses and keeping the lights on isn’t something we want people to be worried  about,” Minister Taylor said.

“For anyone who is experiencing hardship or facing difficulties in paying their bills, I urge  them to contact their retailer to discuss the support that is available.

“However it is important that customers who can pay their bills continue to do so, in  order for support to be provided where it is most needed. Retailers and consumers must  work together.”

Australians can find tips for reducing their energy costs and getting the rebates and help  they are eligible for on energy.gov.au.

Households and small businesses can also use the Government’s free energy price  comparison website Energy Made Easy to shop around for the best deal for their current  situation.
