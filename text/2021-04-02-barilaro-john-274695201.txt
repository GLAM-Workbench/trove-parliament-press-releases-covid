DISASTER GRANTS OPEN TO FLOOD-HIT FARMERS

The Australian Government and NSW Government have today announced grants of up to  $75,000 are now open for eligible primary producers recovering from flood and storm  damage under the Special Disaster Grants program.

Federal Minister for Emergency Management David Littleproud and NSW Deputy Premier  and Minister responsible for Disaster Recovery John Barilaro said farmers and primary  producers in disaster-declared Local Government Areas can now apply for a one-off  $75,000 grant to help them rebuild their livelihood.

“I saw firsthand the devastation caused by these floods. This crucial primary producer grant  demonstrates our unwavering support to regional communities,” Mr Littleproud said.

“With clean-up efforts continuing across NSW, the Commonwealth and NSW Governments  have been working closely together to roll out targeted support to protect regional jobs and  help primary producers facing the difficult task of recovery.”

Mr Barilaro said the NSW Government is committed to helping landholders and primary  producers affected by the recent floods get back on their feet as quickly as possible.

“The NSW Government is building a safer, stronger regional NSW and these grants will be  available quickly so that farmers have the assistance they need to start recovering from  these devastating floods,” Mr Barilaro said.

“Over the last 12 months our primary producers have been crippled by drought, bushfires,  COVID-19, a mouse plague and now floods. These grants will go a long way towards helping  flood victims start to rebuild.

“When regional communities were ripped apart by the 2019-20 bushfires these grants  delivered crucial aid to our hardworking and hard-hit farmers, and now these grants are  available to those who have been impacted by floods.”

Farmers can use the funding to repair fences, dairies, storage sheds, and cattle and sheep  yards destroyed by floodwaters, as well as to buy feed to keep stock alive

Eligible farmers are encouraged to speak to the NSW RAA and apply for funding.
