Katter backs Bill for more senators in rural and northern Australia  KENNEDY MP, Bob Katter has seconded Barnaby Joyce's Private Member's Bill which would split  each state’s senate representation into six regions - like mega electorates - that each vote for two  senators.

Mr Katter said Australia’s Senate is full of people from the capital cities, which leaves rural, regional  and northern Australia without a voice.

“If we had the power in north Queensland a rail line would be built into the Galilee Basin, Hells  Gates and the Bradfield Scheme would be achieved and agriculture would be booming,” he said.

“We have missed out on billions of dollars of investment because our voice has not been heard.

“A separate state for north Queensland is the ultimate goal, but this is a step in the right direction.”

Mr Katter said the current Queensland Government had announced the shutdown of the coal and  cane industries - the lifeblood of the north - and the Federal Government was paralysed by  indecision and process.

“Our tourism is down 30 per cent, maybe even 50 per cent now with the Coronavirus,” he said.

“This is a way to give us a bit more power, a little bit more power.

“The great commentator Alexis de Tocqueville said in his book ‘The Tyranny of the Majority’ that  Democracy doesn’t deliver a fair go, it doesn’t deliver justice and it doesn’t even deliver  representation. But it does deliver the tyranny of the majority.

“In Queensland the Main Roads Department used to be divided up into five areas and they each  received equal funding. So once upon a time there were fair and equal Governments.

“Now, billions of dollars are spent on tunnels and overpasses in Brisbane while we languish in the  north.”  —ENDS—
