TRANSCRIPT

ABC INSIDERS WITH DAVID SPEERS  16 February 2020







E&EO

Subjects:  Leadership, the National Party, Carbon Emissions, Government Grants;

DAVID SPEERS:

Let's start with the leadership question.

Do you have any intention of standing down as leader during this parliamentary term?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

No, I do not, David and I will lead the National Party to the next election.

DAVID SPEERS:

So, what do you make then, of the report in The Australian newspaper this weekend that leading  Nationals and Liberals, Coalition leaders, now believe, you must step down for the survival of the  party?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:    I don't believe that report and I haven't thought it or said it and I'm not quite sure why it was written  in that way. The fact is - I'm the leader and I'm going to lead The Nationals to the next election.  DAVID SPEERS:  Have you spoken to the Prime Minister or any Liberals about this story?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

I have his full support. The Prime Minister and I speak every day, as you would imagine and I have his  full support. I spoke to him this morning, but the leadership wasn't the topic of our conversation this  morning, it was coronavirus, it was other issues - mainly important to regional Australians, because  that's my focus.

DAVID SPEERS:

Are you seriously saying that you're not talking about your leadership with the Prime Minister right  now?



MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

No, I'm not. No. Absolutely. I have the Prime Minister's full support. He said that privately, he said  that publicly. I've got his full support. Why wouldn't I have? We work well together. We work well  together as Liberals and Nationals. We lead different, separate parties, but we lead them in  Government and last May, the people of Australia elected the Liberals and The Nationals to govern  them and that's what we're doing.

DAVID SPEERS:

I hear your determination to stay on and fight the next election as leader, but you are facing a  concerted campaign, it seems, to force you out. Do you see that? Do you accept that? And what are  you going to do about that?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, I've now put myself to the party room as a leader three times in less than two years and three  times in less than two years, I've been endorsed as the party's leader. That should be enough to  draw a line under that discussion.

DAVID SPEERS:

But it's not, because the point is ... Michael McCormack, it's not stopping what's going on here, is it?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, Barnaby Joyce has stated that he will support me. Matt Canavan has. And ...

DAVID SPEERS:

Do you believe them?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, I always believe country people when they look me in the eye and say something and you've  got to take people on their word. You've got to know that when country people look you in the eye  and give you an assurance, that that is what they mean.

DAVID SPEERS:

Can I ask you this - do you intend to change anything about the way you lead? Your leadership  style? Perhaps your policy position at all, in response to what's been going on? Or will you keep  going the way you've been going?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, I think we can always take the free, frank and sometimes even unfiltered advice that we  receive and we all, always, need to be better than what we've been in the past. I'm not perfect. I've  never stated that I am. But, certainly, when it comes to policy, the National Party are as one. We're  as one on making sure that there's more reliable ...





DAVID SPEERS:

I'll come to policy, but what will you change if you're willing to take on the free and unfiltered  advice, what's going to change?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, as David Gillespie said - more inclusivity needs to happen and my door is always open to my  colleagues. My door is always open.

DAVID SPEERS:

So what's that going to look like?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

They know that.

DAVID SPEERS:

What is that going to look like?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, we always discuss things as a party. We make sure that for us, the delivery of regional  Australians has to be first and foremost. And whether that's me changing my leadership style a little  bit, I think we all, every one of us in the National Party room, need to stop concentrating on those  things that we're discussing in Canberra as far as power and self-indulgence and making sure that we  get back to the electorates and concentrate on the things that matter to the people that we  represent and that is a better healthcare system ...

DAVID SPEERS:

If you're going to be more inclusive, is it more cups of tea in the office, or bringing some of your  critics to the front bench?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, a bit of both, I think. When it comes to the front bench, I'm very happy with those who I  selected for those ministerial roles. And certainly, they are going to do a good job. I'm blessed with  talent in the National Party room, and I'm very thankful for that. I've got some tremendous people.

DAVID SPEERS:

Are you willing to bring in those who voted against you?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, the ministry is what the ministry is at the moment, and there's no plans to have a ministerial  change any time soon. But, of course, politics is an interesting game, and as we've seen just over the  last fortnight, things can change. But, for the moment, for the time being and leading up to the next  election, I'm very, very happy with the ministers that have been chosen. I know that Keith Pitt is  going to do an outstanding job in resources, northern Australia and water. I know Kevin Hogan who



has been elevated to the ministry, also deserves his opportunity to represent regional Australia  around the full ministerial table.

DAVID SPEERS:

Let me go you about the leadership rules. Labor and the Liberal Party, they've both changed their  rules to make it harder to turf out a leader and this was in both cases driven by the leader. Kevin  Rudd demanded changes in the Labor Party and got his way. Scott Morrison demanded changes in  the Liberal Party and got his way. Is it time for you to do the same in the National Party?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

I think that that would be a matter for the party and the federal management. And Dr Ann Webster  ...



DAVID SPEERS:

Do you think it is?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

I think that might look self-indulgent and me trying to protect the leadership.

DAVID SPEERS:

Is that how you saw it ... Is that what Scott Morrison was doing?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, Scott Morrison is the leader of Liberal Party and I'm not in the Liberal Party. I don't wish to be.  I'm the leader of the National Party. We do things differently in the National Party and Dr Ann  Webster took a proposal and canvassed it amongst some colleagues. I thought that the proposal had  merit, but that's a matter for the party room and a matter for the federal management as well.

DAVID SPEERS:

What about the Llew O'Brien situation here? He's no longer in the National Party, but he's still sitting  as an LNP member. Can I ask you what you think about this? And whether he should be endorsed by  the LNP at the next election, if he's not willing to be either part of the National or the Liberal Party in  Canberra where it counts, should he be an LNP member?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

The LNP are not a separate party in their own right. They are in Queensland. Of course, the LNP is its  own brand in Queensland, the Liberals and the Nationals merged there some ten or so years ago.  That was for the benefit of Queensland. Dave Hutchinson, the LNP President, and I have spoken and  he doesn't want them to be forming their own party in Canberra. Llew O'Brien, I went to his  electorate on Friday. We had a great day and opened the Sunshine Beach Surf Lifesaving Club and  no-one would have known apart from the events of the previous week or so, that there was any  angst whatsoever between us. We remain good friends. Sharon and Catherine also remain good  friends.



DAVID SPEERS:

I'm sure that's the case. But should he be allowed to be an LNP member, is what I'm getting at here?  This is unprecedented. Should it continue?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, perhaps most importantly David, he's a member of the Government, the Liberals and the  Nationals Government, delivering for Australians.

DAVID SPEERS:

But he's not sitting in any party room in Canberra and I'm asking whether you think that this should  be allowed? Whether he should still be allowed to be an LNP member?



MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Kevin Hogan did this prior to the last election, as you might recall. He went and sat with the  crossbenchers, but sat as an Independent Nationals’ member. And I appreciate from time to time  that different members have different views on Government policy and certainly what goes on in  Canberra. Fact is, and this is an important fact - Llew O'Brien remains a member of the Government,  and will vote with the Government.



DAVID SPEERS:

It sounds like you've got no objection to this? It sounds like you've no objection to the LNP endorsing  someone in this?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Of course, I would prefer him to sit with The Nationals, but for the time being, he's chosen to sit as  an LNP member, but most importantly, as a Government member.

DAVID SPEERS:

Let's talk about policy. Should the Government help fund a new coal-fired power station in  Collinsville?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, I'm really pleased that we've put $4 million on the table for a feasibility study into the HELE  plant in Collinsville. Collinsville is a really important place because it is going to feed into that heavy  resource sector and heavy industrial city of Gladstone in central Queensland. Now, there's a lot of  energy requirements in Gladstone and the plant at Urana and the one at Collinsville forming  hydroelectricity and HELE coal will be really important for Gladstone going forward.

DAVID SPEERS:

So it should go ahead in your view?





MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, if it ticks all the boxes, of course it should go ahead. I mean, we want to make sure that when it  comes to energy needs, that it is affordable, reliable, but it's technology, not taxation. That's the  important thing. The Labor way, the Greens’ way, is just to whack a cost on everything. What we  want to make sure is that we've got a reliable and affordable mix of energy technologies.

DAVID SPEERS:

What is your position on the idea of a net zero emissions target by 2050?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

What we want to make sure is that affordable, reliable power is there for family, for households, for  farmers, for factories and industries. What I don't want to see happen is our industries and our  farmers being forced offshore, having to import food like there was no tomorrow. I want to make  sure that Australians have the cleanest, greenest vegetables and grain and produce available on our  farms, but that our farmers can do it in the most reliable way, cost-efficient way, and certainly  making sure that they have affordable electricity -  that's the important thing.

DAVID SPEERS:

Is there any chance that you would support the target of net zero emissions by 2050?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, I think if you go down that path, what you're going to do is send factories and industries  offshore. Send manufacturing jobs offshore. That's not the Australian way. Regional Australia is  more than doing its fair share, its fair share as far as making sure that we have lower emissions. And  of course, we don't know what technologies are going to be invented over the next 30 years. It's a  long way down the track to 2050. What I want to make sure and what The Nationals are working  towards is making sure that we have reliable, affordable energy. I know Angus Taylor, that's his goal.  I know for Scott Morrison, that's his goal.

DAVID SPEERS:

But some Liberals, Trent Zimmerman today, is quoted in The Guardian as saying that he wants to  support this 2050 net zero emissions target. It sounds like you're going to take the opposite view?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

I'm not the member for North Sydney and good luck to Trent Zimmerman. What I want to make sure  is that there is reliable, affordable power. What I want to make sure, and Opposition members have  said this too - that there is a future for labour. Heaven knows they've got their own ginger group, a  rebel group within Parliament.

DAVID SPEERS:

We'll talk about that later. Just on this idea, though, the IPCC, which is the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change says that we must cut emissions to zero by 2050 to avoid a global temperature  rise of 1.5 degrees. Do you agree with that?





MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

The IPCC is not governing Australia. The Liberals and Nationals are. We took all of the emissions  policies to the election last May and we were re-elected. The Australian people have spoken. We're  not run by international organisations. We're run by Australians. We're run by Scott Morrison and  we're run by myself. And we're run by the Liberals and Nationals.

DAVID SPEERS:

You've got to listen to the science, though?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Of course you've got to listen to the scientists but what you've also got to do is listen to the workers.  Listen to the workers who put on a high-vis vest in a coalmine. The people in central and northern  Queensland who rely on the resources sector for a job, for a future. And let's face it - coal provides  $66 billion of exports, 55,000 jobs and two thirds of our energy needs. Why wouldn't we want to  support that important sector?

DAVID SPEERS:

A couple of other things. One of the biggest problems in regional areas is under employment -  people who can't get enough work. This is one particular problem in National Party seats in those  regional areas. Some of the highest levels of under employment in places like Cowper and Tweed  and New England. A problem that's worsened under your watch. What have you been doing about  it?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

The drought hasn't helped, David, and certainly the bushfires aren't either. But we're making sure  that we increase the skill sets of particularly young Australians. We're making sure, and the  December jobless figures were very good. We had a drop in the unemployment levels. What I want  to make sure is ... What we want to make sure is that for those people in Sydney, Melbourne and  Brisbane watching this show, as I'm sure they should be, that we want to make sure that we get the  message out there that regional Australia is not broken. There is a great future to be had in regional  Australia. I saw a report the other day talking about the lack of an Australian backyard. Well, you can  buy a house with a backyard anywhere in regional Australia at an affordable cost, and I encourage  people to take that tree change, to look at a regional area, because there are jobs, there are  opportunities out here. It’s a great place to live and work and invest.

DAVID SPEERS:

OK, you're right about that. Can I ask you finally, about the grants schemes. The one that you were in  charge of before the election, the $150 million female facilities and water safety stream, men for  female change rooms and swimming pools. The incoming Government brief clearly states that the  money was allocated in the Government for "regional development" and says that the stakeholders  are regional and remote communities, but very little went to regional communities - less than 10%  going to National Party seats. Some of the seats got nothing at all. Most of it went to Liberal held  seats, marginal Liberal seats, about $113 million went to Liberal held seats. Why didn't more of the  money meant for regional Australia go to regional Australia?





MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, regional Australia doesn't miss out under The Nationals being in Government.

DAVID SPEERS:

I'm asking under this scheme that you administered? Were you rolled on this?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Absolutely not. And I'm pleased that the delivery for female change rooms has been such that under  the program that Bridget McKenzie ran ...

DAVID SPEERS:

I'm asking about the program that you ran.

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Sure.

DAVID SPEERS:

I'm asking about the female facilities and water safety screen under your administration. Why did  the money largely go to the cities?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

And over a spread, you will see that regional Australia and metropolitan Australia all received fair  and equitable funding when it comes to providing it.

DAVID SPEERS:

Is less than 10% of the funding fair and equitable?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, what we want to make sure is that there is this sort of funding, and you can do it when you've  got a balanced economy, you can do it when you have an economy working.

DAVID SPEERS:

I'm asking whether less than 10% for the National Party seats is fair?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Well, I'm sure in future rounds, that regional Australia will get more than just 10%.

DAVID SPEERS:  The money is nearly spent from this project?









MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

We are providing funding for regional areas, for metropolitan areas and female participation in sport  is growing. I'm pleased that I'm here in Wagga Wagga where AFLW, women's competition of AFL, is  a huge and booming sport. And we're providing the sort of funding for that, for netball, for soccer.  Whatever girls want to play, we're making sure that they get the change room, they're getting the  facilities that boys have always enjoyed and why is it fair that women have to change in cars and  behind trees when the boys have proper toilets and bathroom facilities to play their sport?

DAVID SPEERS:

Alright, Michael McCormack, Deputy Prime Minister. Thank you for joining us.

MICHAEL MCCORMACK:

Thank you, David, any time at all.
