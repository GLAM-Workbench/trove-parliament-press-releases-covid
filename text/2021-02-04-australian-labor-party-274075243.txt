E&OE TRANSCRIPT

DOORSTOP INTERVIEW

PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA

THURSDAY, 4 FEBRUARY 2021



SUBJECTS: WA bushfire; Christensen and Canavan still backing COVID conspiracy

theories.



MURRAY WATT, QUEENSLAND LABOR SENATOR: Well, good morning. Of course,

everyone in Canberra is still keeping a very close eye on what's happening with the bushfires

in Western Australia. We now seem to have lost about 71 homes and there's obviously a lot of

other property and nature destruction that's occurred as well. So still very worrying scenes over

there.



I received a briefing yesterday on behalf of the Opposition from Emergency Management

Australia, and they made very clear that we're not out of the woods yet. The tropical low thatâ€˜s

sitting on the north of Western Australia could bring very strong winds to the area that's

currently experiencing bushfires so probably still facing a few dangerous days ahead. So, as I

said yesterday, it's important that everyone listens to emergency broadcasts, conditions can

change very quickly. We're all thinking of people in WA at the moment.



The other issue I just wanted to touch on is the ongoing issues around conspiracy theories

being spread about COVID vaccines by a growing number of Government backbenchers.





Yesterday, Scott Morrison tried to say that he had actually sorted this out, he'd stopped Craig

Kelly and all of this nonsense was going to stop. But within hours of Craig Kelly allegedly being

shut down, we've seen George Christensen and Matt Canavan out on social media, backing in

the very views that Craig Kelly has now disowned and agreed to not put forward.



So this is still a problem for the Prime Minister and for Deputy Prime Minister Michael

McCormack, because it now seems that this issue has spread to the National Party, not just

the Liberal Party with Mr Kelly.



The problem for Mr Morrison is that he's let the genie out of the bottle. He's allowed a number

of backbenchers to get out there, play footsie with the far-right in the Australian community and

overseas as well, peddling conspiracy theories on COVID vaccines and all sorts of other

issues, which have a very direct cost to the Australian people. Because undermining public

confidence in our vaccine system is actually going to be putting lives at risk in Australia.



So this is not some silly little game from Scott Morrison and his teammates. This is serious. It

potentially could cost lives.



And it's now up to Scott Morrison and Michael McCormack to put the genie back in the bottle.

They've got to rein in people like George Christensen and Matt Canavan as well. Otherwise

they will continue spreading misinformation, conspiracies and dangerous information to the

Australian public.
