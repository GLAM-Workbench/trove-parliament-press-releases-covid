NATALIE BARR

For more, I'm joined by acting Prime Minister Michael McCormack. Morning to you, firstly. Does Gladys  -

MICHAEL MCCORMACK

Morning, from a very wet Townsville, Nat.

NATALIE BARR

Yes, I can see that. Well, thank you for joining us this morning. Does the New South Wales Premier  Gladys Berejiklian have a point? Are state and territory leaders being too hasty when it comes to these  border closures?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK

Well, I think what we've seen is New South Wales be the standard-bearer as far as the contact tracking  and tracing with coronavirus, and they have shared the heavy burden of responsibility when it comes to  returning Australians to quarantining them. So, I think any criticism of New South Wales -  which has  done very, very well keeping its economy open, keeping the borders open and getting these businesses

to go as much as normal as possible -  I think any criticism of New South Wales is very hasty. And I know  Gladys Berejiklian has achieved great things with Dr Kerry Chant, of course, the Chief Health Officer in  New South Wales. They put those contact tracking and tracing in place and they have been very much  the benchmark as far as what to do during the coronavirus.

NATALIE BARR

The WA Premier is very popular thousands and thousands of people support his approach. He said,  “They are killing this virus, New South Wales should look to them because that's the way they should do  it; not live with the virus.” What do you think of that?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK

Well, Western Australia and New South Wales are very different states as far as - look at the New South  Wales border, for instance and the 57 bridges and openings across to Victoria. I mean, the Tweed River  area with Queensland, it's just a massive economic area. Western Australia doesn't have anything like  that. So, it's easier for Western Australia to obviously shut its borders and keep them shut tight and I  appreciate that West Australians look to their Premier and Mark McGowan. Yes, he's done a good job.  Look, it's been very difficult there's no playbook for coronavirus. There's no book that you can get down  off the shelf which says “COVID-19: how to cope” and so, very much the state Premiers are put in place  submissions that they think is right and responsible to keep the public health safety aspects for their  states as what they need to be. And I say to all Australians, thank you for doing what you've done with  social distancing, with mask-wearing. We're not out of this yet, but speaking to Greg Hunt yesterday, the  Minister for Health federally, we've got that vaccine, we're going to be rolling it out next month. So, you  know, this is very much light at the end of the tunnel, this has been a very difficult process we're  certainly not out of it yet, and I asked and implore, urge, Australians, all Australians, to keep doing what  you've been doing. You've been magnificent so far. It is very difficult. Nine hundred and nine families, of  course, have lost loved ones it's been very difficult. But I'd say again, New South Wales has done a  mighty job in getting Australians home. 443,000 Australians have come home since March 13. The Prime  Minister urgently encouraged them to do so. And let's face it, it's been a very difficult, challenging year  and 2021 is also going to be tough.

NATALIE BARR

Well, we know you've got another interview to go to but just quickly on Victoria's traffic light system  that they've just introduced. Should they have consulted with other states first? Do you agree with that?

MICHAEL MCCORMACK

Well, Daniel Andrews, I appreciate he’s back at work. He's got my number. I spoke to Jacinta Allen in his  absence, who was the Acting Premier. We've got a nationally consistent hotspot definition. Look, again,  they didn't consult with the Federal Government, but look let's get through this. A traffic permit, a traffic

light, sort of permit system, let's see how it unfolds. But we don't want to put more things in place,  which is going to inconvenience more Australians, more Victorians, particularly regional Victorians,  who've been impacted very unfairly, I'd say. Many of them haven't had a coronavirus in their  communities for many months, if at all and they were very much impinged upon by the decisions made  by Spring Street. But look, let's get through it. Let's see what happens and let's get that vaccine rolled  out.

NATALIE BARR

Okay, that was pretty clear. Michael McCormack, thank you for your time this morning.

MICHAEL MCCORMACK

Thanks, Nat.
