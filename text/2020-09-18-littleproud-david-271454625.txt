Stranded cats and dogs to be reunited  with owners under new arrangement

Cats and dogs may now be transhipped via Sydney to the Post Entry Quarantine Facility in  Melbourne under a new temporary arrangement with Qantas airlines when there is no  option for them to fly directly to Melbourne.

Minster for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management, David Littleproud said the  temporary arrangement is great news for Australians with pets stranded overseas due the  pandemic.

“Pets are part of the family in almost every household in Australia,” Minister Littleproud  said.

“The Australian Government understands how hard it has been for some pet owners to  make the difficult decision to leave their pets behind due to the COVID-19 inflicted travel  restrictions.

“That is why we have worked with Qantas to offer an alternative arrangement for cats and  dogs to be reunited with their families during these difficult times.

“Qantas has demonstrated they can effectively comply with all of Australia’s biosecurity  requirements and I thank them for their work to make this a reality, Minister Littleproud  said.

“Biosecurity will never be traded off and import conditions must be met in full before any  pet can come to Australia.

“Despite current state government COVID restrictions our quarantine facility continues to  operate and meet demand from pet owners for bookings.

“We also shouldn’t forget that throughout the pandemic my department has worked closely  with owners, pet transport agents and airlines on arrangements that have safely delivered  over 1200 pets to our Quarantine facility in Melbourne since May.

“This arrangement will allow those pets waiting overseas where there are no direct flights  to Melbourne to get home to Australia.

“I look forward to seeing Australian’s being reunited with their beloved pets and hope that  this brings some happiness during a difficult period.”

Chief Customer Officer, Qantas Freight International, Nick McGlynn said pet movements  into Australia remain restricted due to the limited number of flights, but the option to use  Sydney as a transfer port will go a long way towards helping reunite them with their  owners.

“Setting up Sydney as an alternative pet transfer hub has been made possible due to the  close collaboration between a number of government departments and Qantas,” Mr  McGlynn said.



Fast Facts  Ã¯ÂÂ· Cats and dogs entering Australia must still undergo a quarantine period in the  Australian Government Post Entry Quarantine Facility in Mickleham,  Melbourne.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Nearly 2800 dogs and cats have arrived in Australia during 2020 including

more than 1200 since May 2020 when air transport for pets recommenced  following an airline-imposed embargo in March 2020.  Ã¯ÂÂ· This is around 60 per cent of the volume in same period in 2019.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Transhipment is only available under limited eligibility, where other flights are  not available.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Given the preparation that must be undertaken to prepare animals for their  journey this arrangement will be available from late September.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Information on biosecurity requirements to bring cats and dogs to Australia is  available at agriculture.gov.au/cats-dogs.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Where a direct service into Melbourne is not operating, pet owners will need  to contact a local pet travel specialist to arrange their pet travel.   Ã¯ÂÂ· The option to use Sydney as a transfer port is contingent upon available  capacity and services for connections into Melbourne.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Where there is an identified need, the airlines will work with the department  on making suitable arrangements for transfer flights.
