JOBS CRISIS WORSENS FOR YOUNG AUSTRALIANS

Today’s October ABS Labour Force Figures show the youth unemployment rate is now at  15.6 per cent, with 337,200 young people without work.

This is a one per cent jump in unemployment for young people since September,  compared to 0.1 per cent for the overall population.

The story is worse around the country - with youth unemployment up 3.6 per cent in  Victoria, 2.9 per cent in South Australia, and 2.4 per cent in the Northern Territory.

Youth underutilisation is at 33.5 per cent - meaning one in three young Australians are  looking for work or more work.

Young people have been hit hard by the COVID pandemic. They need more than just  marketing slogans and short term measures from the Morrison Government.

It has recently been revealed that the JobMaker Hiring Credit, which Scott Morrison holds  up as the silver bullet for youth unemployment, is only expected to create 10 per cent of  the 450,000 jobs the Government claimed would be supported by the program.

Young people desperately need a meaningful, holistic plan to get them through the crisis  and into long-term, secure careers.

Labor continues to call on the Morrison Government to urgently develop a COVID-19  Youth Recovery Strategy, that is co-designed with young people and outlines clear short,  medium and long term goals.

Unfortunately, Scott Morrison has failed to deliver a jobs plan for Australians and has failed



to deliver a plan for young people.
