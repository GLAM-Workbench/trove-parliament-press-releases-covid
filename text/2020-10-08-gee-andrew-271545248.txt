JOB-READY GRADUATES PACKAGE GIVEN THE TICK OF  APPROVAL WITH REGIONAL UNIVERSITY PLACES TO GROW AT A  FASTER RATE

The Australian Government’s Job-ready Graduates Package which creates additional regional  university student places and provides more money for country students and universities has  received positive backing.

The Coalition Government and Senate today endorsed the Job-ready Graduates legislation with  amendments advocated for by The Nationals in government. The key amendments include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Social work, mental health and psychology: The Job-ready Graduates Package  funding clusters will be amended to align social work and other mental health disciplines  with allied health in the Commonwealth Grant Scheme (CGS) funding cluster 2.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Tertiary Access Payment (TAP): The Tertiary Access Payment will now be paid  directly to universities to then be provided to regional and remote students through  scholarships. This change will level the playing field for our country universities and  allow them to attract new students through scholarship incentives.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Grandfathering  The Department of Education, Skills and Employment will not proceed with the initial  grandfathering date of 1 January 2024. This change will make it easier for Australians  balancing work and family commitments to upskill and be ‘job-ready’. It also means that  students currently studying online or part-time won’t be caught out by potential fee  structure changes in 2024.

Minister for Regional Education, Andrew Gee, said the amended Job-ready Graduates Package  was positive news for the bush, with an additional $400 million in funding and faster domestic  student places growth for regional universities.

“The Package has received widespread support, with regional universities and prominent  tertiary education networks such as the Regional University Network and the Group of Eight  backing the legislation - it’s fantastic to see the Australian Parliament do the same.

“The regional universities like that Commonwealth supported student places grow at a faster  rate for country universities, they like the $21 million for Regional University Centres and they  like the $48.8 million to support their research and development programs.

“The Package demonstrates in a very tangible way that the Australian Government is backing  country universities, country students and country communities.

“Regional Australia is facing its biggest jobs crisis since the Great Depression, with the impacts  of the drought, bushfires and COVID-19 pandemic hitting communities hard.

“Now is the time for our university system to respond to this challenge by strengthening its focus  on Australian students.

“I want each and every Australian, no matter where they live, to have equal access to a world-class education and job opportunities following graduation which is why I fought so hard for  amendments to the Job-ready Graduates Package.

“I believe the successful amendments will help bridge the gap between country communities  and the cities, including the divide in educational attainment and access to services such as  mental health.

“This Package delivers real benefits for the regions and I will continue to work closely with  country universities and country communities to ensure they are well positioned to take  advantage of the many opportunities that the Job-ready Graduates package offers.”
