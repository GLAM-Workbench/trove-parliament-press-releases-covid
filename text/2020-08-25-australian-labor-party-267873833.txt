LUKE GOSING OAM MP

MEMBER FOR SOLOMON





E&OE TRANSCRIPT  RADIO INTERVIEW   ABC BREAKFAST WITH JO LAVERTY   TUESDAY, 25 AUGUST 2020

SUBJECT: US-Northern Territory relationship.

JO LAVERTY, HOST: The Member for Solomon, Luke Gosling, has picked up the good fight. Hello,  Mr Gosling.

LUKE GOSLING, MEMBER FOR SOLOMON: Good morning, Jo. How are you?

LAVERTY: Very well. You've taken the fight to the upper echelons of the US Embassy here in  Australia. What have you done today?

GOSLING: Well I was listening in to the program this morning and just heard this shocking reporting  about the pronunciation of emu in the United States. There was someone on public radio there trying  to say that it could be pronounced 'ee-moo' and I was very incensed by this.  As I was on the way to  meet with the American Ambassador at the time I raised it directly with him and a longer  conversation ensued about pronunciation of the different ways and inflections and accents between  Australians and Americans. At the end of the day he directed his staff to chase up the emu fiasco  and get some answers.

LAVERTY: That's wonderful. Well done, very patriotic of you Luke Gosling and of course you were  speaking to the US Ambassador about a range of other things, not just how to pronounce emu. What  else did you speak to the Ambassador about?

GOSLING: An upcoming visit to Darwin, he's coming up to meet with the business community and to  meet with the Marines who are training with our Australian troops in the Top End. Also about critical  minerals, the mining opportunities and the different ways that we can work together to use critical  minerals for advanced manufacturing. I mentioned to him the work of people like Andrew Liveris who  is from Darwin, but spent a long time in the United States and is now working on the COVID  Commission to rebound the economy. I put in a big plug for advanced manufacturing in the Top End.  The Ambassador pointed out that when you combine Australian exports to the US and the income  generated from US investment in Australia, it's something like $131 billion, which is about seven  percent of Australia's GDP. That's from some work that Deloitte has done recently and I just said  yes, let's get some get some more of that commerce happening in the Top End. So he's looking  forward to his visit and he's taken up the 'ee-moo' issue.

LAVERTY: I hope that when he comes and visits he might be able to pop in and say hello to us at  the ABC.

GOSLING: I'll definitely mention that the invitation has been extended Jo.



LAVERTY: Wonderful. Thank you good speak with you today, stay warm down there.

GOSLING: Yeah I'll try. It's going to be colder tomorrow apparently!

LAVERTY: Thank you very much Luke Gosling, Member for Solomon, down in Canberra.
