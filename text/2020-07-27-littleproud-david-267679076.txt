Blockchain traceability supports brand Australia

Ã¯ÂÂ· FreshChain's blockchain-based system is one of 16 projects to share in $4  million funding under the Traceability Grants Program.  Ã¯ÂÂ· The technology will help protect the Australian brand in export markets.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Modern, accurate and timely traceability systems provide assurances to trading

partners and consumers about the safety and quality of our produce.

The Australian Government is investing in an advanced blockchain traceability system that will  help protect our clean, green and safe food image - and boost export opportunities for farmers.

Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management Minister David Littleproud said North  Sydney-based FreshChain Systems will use $195,000 in Traceability Grants Program funding  to digitise end-to-end traceability in horticulture across Australia.

“FreshChain's end-to-end traceability system has broad applications across all food, fibre and  agricultural products for authentication, provenance, food safety and consumer engagement,”  Minister Littleproud said.

“This system that ensures food safety, biosecurity and traceability will benefit all participants in  the supply chain.

“It supports the National Traceability Framework and protects the Australian brand in export  markets by preventing food fraud, reducing food waste and maintaining consumer confidence.

“It’s important during these challenging times have a resilient fresh food supply system.

“With innovations like this from FreshChain, we can show consumers domestically and  internationally greater transparency and real time convenience around the origins and safety  of agricultural products.

“The Australian Government invests in projects like these because modern, accurate, and  timely traceability systems help provide even stronger assurances to our trading partners and  consumers about the safety and quality of our fantastic produce.”

Member for North Sydney Trent Zimmerman said FreshChain Systems will pilot its blockchain-enabled technology across high-risk horticultural products like melons, berries and leafy  greens from field to fork.

“In collaboration with industry partners, the project will demonstrate the benefits of technology,  ease of integration and adoption across the supply chain through to export markets,” Mr  Zimmerman said.

“They will develop a data-sharing portal for registered supply chain participants including  government agencies for rapid response and targeted product recall during food safety  emergencies.

“COVID-19 has significantly heightened consumer awareness about where our food comes  from so end-to-end assurance systems like this will be even more important.

“I am proud to say that an innovative Aussie company based right here in North Sydney is one  of the world leaders in developing this technology and the Australian Government looks  forward to seeing the results of the pilot.”

Greg Calvert of FreshChain said: “Our goal is to help build a resilient fresh food supply chain  where systems speak the same language to enhance Australia’s reputation as a supplier of  fresh and safe food.”

FreshChain Systems’ project is one of 16 to share in $4 million funding under the first round of  the Australian Government’s Traceability Grants Program.

The $7 million program will run over a minimum of two rounds until June 2023. For more  details click on this link www.agriculture.gov.au.



FAST FACTS:  Ã¯ÂÂ· The Traceability Grants Program supports industry projects that will enhance our  agricultural supply chain traceability systems, including developing and trialling  technologies that digitise information flow.

Ã¯ÂÂ· The program also aims to provide an advantage for our exporters in overseas  markets and to increase opportunities to export Australian commodities.

Ã¯ÂÂ· The program is part of the Australian Government’s Modernising Agricultural Trade  agenda to support the target of a $100 billion agricultural sector by 2030.
