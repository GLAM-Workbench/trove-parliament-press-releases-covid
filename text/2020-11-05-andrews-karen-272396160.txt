GRANTS FOR RESEARCH PROJECTS USING CITIZEN SCIENCE

5 November 2020

Australian organisations with research project ideas that encourage the community  to get involved are invited to apply for a Citizen Science grant.

Grants of between $150,000 and $500,000 are available to support projects that  enable community participation in four key research areas: disaster resilience and  preparedness, environmental change, cyber security and artificial intelligence, and  food and agribusiness.

Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Karen Andrews said the grants  provide an opportunity for communities across the country to participate in projects  that could have a national impact.

“Science will play a vital role in resetting and growing the Australian economy as we  recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the devastating bushfires we saw earlier  this year,” Minister Andrews said.

“Through this program, the Government is enabling Aussie scientists to collaborate  with their local communities to contribute to our scientific knowledge and come up  with innovative solutions to some of our biggest national challenges.

“These grants may also provide support for our research institutions and  organisations so that important projects which have been delayed or otherwise  impacted by COVID-19 restrictions can continue.”

Citizen Science Grants are part of the Inspiring Australia - Science Engagement  Programme, which encourages community participation in science and technology,  with $4 million available over four years.

Applications for Round 2 are open until 17 December. For more information visit  https://business.gov.au/grants-and-programs/citizen-science-grants
