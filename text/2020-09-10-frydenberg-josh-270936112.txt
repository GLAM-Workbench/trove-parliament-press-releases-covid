JOINT CALL OF FINANCE MINISTERS

New Zealand Finance Minister Hon Grant Robertson today hosted a call with his counterparts from  Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.

We shared experiences of using monetary and fiscal policy in our respective countries, as part of our  Governmentsâ€™ economic responses to COVID-19. All nations have undertaken significant fiscal  stimulus programmes to protect households, support businesses and build a base for recovery. This is  being complemented by major monetary policy interventions from independent central banks to  support the functioning of the financial system and the flow of credit.

The meeting was highly productive, and highlighted similar economic challenges our countries are  facing as a result of the ongoing pandemic. In particular, we acknowledged the importance of mutually  reinforcing monetary and fiscal policies to support our responses to COVID-19. We agreed that these  were working well together in our respective responses.

The meeting was the fourth in a series of regular calls between the five Finance Ministers, which focus  on economic issues associated with COVID-19.

The sharing of experiences between like-minded partners is valuable, particularly as we collectively face  common economic challenges caused by the global pandemic, which require monetary and fiscal  responses. We will continue to discuss our respective responses and experiences as we rebuild our  economies from COVID-19.

Ends.
