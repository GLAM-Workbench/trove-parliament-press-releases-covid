ONE IN THREE YOUNG PEOPLE LOOKING FOR WORK OR MORE WORK



Today’s September ABS Labour Force Figures show the youth unemployment rate is now

at 14.5 per cent, with 302,900 young people without work.



Underutilisation is now up to 33.7 per cent - meaning one in three young Australians are

looking for work or more work.



Young people have been disproportionately hit by the COVID pandemic - suffering from

high unemployment, social isolation, depleted retirement savings, interruptions to

education and training, and severe mental health impacts.



Our young people are expected to suffer short and long term consequences, and will be

left with less earning potential, fewer job opportunities, less housing security, and less

retirement savings.



Young people need more than just marketing slogans and short term measures from the

Morrison Government.





They need a holistic plan to get them through the crisis and into long-term, secure careers.



The Government must urgently develop a COVID-19 Youth Recovery Strategy, that is co-designed with young people and outlines clear short, medium and long term goals.



Unfortunately Scott Morrison has failed to deliver a jobs plan for Australians, and has failed

to deliver a plan for young people.



Scott Morrison must ensure young Australians are not left out and left behind in this

recession.
