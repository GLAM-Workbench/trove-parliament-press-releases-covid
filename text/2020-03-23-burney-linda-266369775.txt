MINISTER MUST GET CENTRELINK WORKING FOR AUSTRALIA

It has never been more important for the social security safety net to be strong in this country.

Many families, workers and business owners who have never accessed social security before  are being forced to by the financial effects of the coronavirus.

People should not have to wait weeks to access these vital payments.

But at this hour of need Australians are having to grapple with inadequate service, online  glitches, and a lack of planning to deal with demand at Centrelink shopfronts.

Around the nation there are queues around the block at Centrelink offices (photos below) as  first-time social security recipients are told they can only get a Customer Reference Number by  going into shopfronts in person.

And online myGov has once again crashed despite demand being entirely foreseeable.

Government Services Minister Stuart Robert must do better.

He must ensure Centrelink services - online and in person - are working now when Australians  need them most.
