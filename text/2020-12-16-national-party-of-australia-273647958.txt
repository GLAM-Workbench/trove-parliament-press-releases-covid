REGIONAL AUSTRALIA SUPPORTED THROUGH ROUND FIVE OF  THE BUILDING BETTER REGIONS FUND

Local communities across Australia, especially those hardest hit by the loss of regional tourism, are a  step closer to sharing in $200 million under a fifth round of the successful Building Better Regions  Fund (BBRF).

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development Michael  McCormack said the launch of the program guidelines meant prospective applicants could now begin  planning their project applications for assessment.

“The Australian Government is supporting regional communities across the nation with a particular  focus in this round on regional tourism,” the Deputy Prime Minister said.

“Our regional communities across Australia have had a year like no other, battling bushfires, the  continuing effects of the prolonged drought and COVID-19, while still doing so much to support our  exports and the wider economy.

“We are backing those efforts with $100 million of targeted support for tourism-related  infrastructure, while maintaining $100 million for broader community infrastructure and investment.

“This funding will create jobs and drive economic growth in our rural and remote communities at a  time it is needed most.”

Since 2016, the Liberal and Nationals Government have funded nearly 1,000 projects through the  BBRF, securing the future of so many regional communities. Round Five brings the Federal  Government’s total commitment for the BBRF to more than $1 billion over seven years.

The guidelines have now been released and can be found at www.business.gov.au/bbrf meaning  local proponents can now start developing their applications.

Applications open on 12 January 2021 and close on 5 March 2021. Successful applicants are expected  to be announced in mid-2021.

Ends.
