MICHELLE ROWLAND MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS  MEMBER FOR GREENWAY

AXING OF SENIOR EXECUTIVE BONUSES AT AUSTRALIA POST

The Australia Post Board has finally folded in the face of pressure from Labor and the  Australian public and withdrawn the absurd proposal to pay senior executive bonuses  while at the same time cutting postal deliveries for consumers.

The Sydney Morning Herald had reported the CEO had quietly sought up to $7 million in  executive bonuses, despite ruling out such bonuses in March. This came as the  Government cut the frequency of mail delivery, a move Labor has been fighting to block in  the Parliament.

Labor welcomes todayâ€™s dumping of these executive bonuses, but this is by no means  over.

Scott Morrison should follow suit and dump his plan to cut the frequency of mail delivery,  whether it is in our cities or our regions.

He and his hapless Minister, Paul Fletcher, have been caught out trying to use COVID-19  as a backdoor excuse to degrade postal services and attack jobs.

Neither Labor nor the Australian public will have a bar of it.
