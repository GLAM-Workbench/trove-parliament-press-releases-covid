E&EO TRANSCRIPT

DOORSTOP INTERVIEW

PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA

WEDNESDAY, 7 OCTOBER 2020



SUBJECTS: Prevention of domestic and family violence; Women and the economy;

Federal Budget.



SENATOR JENNY MCALLISTER: Good morning. During COVID-19, the epidemic of

violence against Australian women in Australian homes has continued and intensified. And

yet last night, we saw a budget, which delivered not one extra dollar for frontline services

to support women and their children facing down that violence.



What does this practically mean? Well, it means that women will be turned away from

emergency accommodation. It means that women seeking specialist support services will

not receive that support. It means women seeking legal advice to support themselves and

their children will not receive that specialist legal advice.  And it means that women on

temporary migrant visas will not be able to access the support that they require.



It comes in the context of a budget that does not meet the needs of Australian women. As



my colleague, the spokesperson for women, Julie Collins said last night, this is a budget

that does not take account of the needs of Australian women.



It is as though the government looked at what women need and just crossed every

measure off the list. There are no investments to improve the affordability and availability

of childcare. There are no initiatives to tackle the gender pay gap or tackle the retirement

income gap. There are no investments in the industries that employ and support Australian

women's employment. And there is no big picture story for the care economy.



Marise Payne went out just a few days ago and said that women's interests needed to be

at the heart of reconstruction after COVID-19. Well, there is precious little to show for it in

the budget that was brought down last night.



JOURNALIST: So, are there any positives in the budget?



MCALLISTER: There are very limited initiatives for Australian women in the budget. The

Women's Economic Security Statement - much fanfare about that - the government is

spending half the amount on that statement that they are on an initiative to improve the IT

resources at service Australia. This is a government that is not taking womenâ€™s interests

into account when they are making economic decisions.
