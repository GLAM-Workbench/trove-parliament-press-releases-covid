ASTRAZENECA APPROVAL - TIME FOR VACCINE ROLLOUT

It’s great news for Australians that the TGA has approved the AstraZeneca vaccine - this is a  huge effort by our regulators.

The vaccine rollout should already be well underway.

In the EU, UK, USA and Canada, once the vaccines were approved by their regulators,  injections were being administered in less than a week.

In Australia, the Pfizer vaccine was approved more than three weeks ago, on the 25th of  January, and we are still waiting for the first jab.

The Health Minister confirmed today we might not receive AstraZeneca supply until early  March.

In December the Health Minister said, “Australians will be ‘fully vaccinated’ against Covid by  the end of October”. With a 12 week wait time between AstraZeneca doses it will be hard to  see how Scott Morrison keeps that promise.

Every day in this pandemic matters for our health and our economy.

There are still a number of very serious questions about the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine.

How will the online booking system work? How will the vaccines be distributed to the states?  When will we start to see jabs actually in people’s arms?

Australians want clarity about the vaccine rollout and they need more details from the Prime  Minister and Health Minister.
