VIRTUAL PARLIAMENT NEEDED NOW





Independent Member for Clark, Andrew Wilkie, will demand the Federal Government drags  Parliament House into the 21st Century and sets up a virtual parliament.

When: 12.30pm TODAY 20 August 2020  Where: Parliament House lawns Hobart Tasmania

Mr Wilkie explores this issue in the August edition of his online newsreel The Wilkie  Report, which can be viewed here: https://andrewwilkie.org/the-wilkie-report-august-2020-australia-needs-a-virtual-parliament/

A transcript follows.

Well here we are, almost six months into the pandemic and it’s dangerously  negligent that the Federal Government still hasn’t got a virtual parliament up and  running. For months the advice has been clear, to use technology to work from home  when you can. But when it comes to running the country, it’s do as I say, and not as I  do.

Frankly it’s not good enough that next week MPs and their staff, from all over  Australia, will gather in Canberra in their many hundreds for Federal Parliament.  Heavens the technology exists, as shown by the British Parliament which has been  meeting virtually since April.

Yes, the Attorney-General has questioned whether parliamentary privilege can  extend online. But surely this is a nonsense, because parliamentary committees  have been meeting outside of Parliament House for decades without a problem.

Moreover lawyers say there’s simply nothing in the Australian Constitution  preventing an online parliament, and we’ve all seen on the telly how well the National  Cabinet works.

Look my community is very concerned about the prospect of another COVID-19  outbreak. So it’s way beyond time the Federal Government, especially now that the  ALP has finally come around, got off its butt and organised virtual sittings. Until it  does, it’s failing us all badly.
