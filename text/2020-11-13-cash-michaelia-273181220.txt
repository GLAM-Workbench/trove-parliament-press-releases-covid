MUTUAL OBLIGATION REQUIREMENTS RETURN FOR  VICTORIAN JOB SEEKERS

The Morrison Government will introduce a further step in the gradual return to mutual  obligation arrangements for job seekers residing in, or serviced by, a provider in Victoria  from 23 November 2020.

Mutual obligations were suspended for job seekers as a result of COVID-19 restrictions in  March 2020 but have been gradually reintroduced as coronavirus restrictions have eased  across Australia. The re-introduction of mutual obligations in Victoria on 23 November will  bring the state into line with all other states and territories’ requirements that have been in  effect since 28 September 2020.

A range of economic indicators reveal that the economy is recovering - with more Australians  returning to the workforce and many businesses now looking for workers.

Mutual obligation requirements will apply to all job seekers in Victoria in jobactive, Online  Employment Services, Disability Employment Services and participants in the ParentsNext  program.

As part of the arrangements, from 23 November job seekers may be subject to income  support payment suspensions or penalties if mutual obligation requirements are not met and  there is no valid reason.

Elements of mutual obligation requirements for job seekers may include:   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ participating in appointments with their employment service provider,   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ agreeing to a job plan,   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ participating in agreed activities where it is safe to do so,   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ looking for a maximum of 8 jobs a month,   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ accepting an offer of suitable work.



For some job seekers, who have been on income support for 12 months, Work for the Dole  activities will also recommence where it is safe to do so and all health and safety  requirements are met.

Given the changing nature of the labour market, with many roles changing significantly  because of COVID-19, the Government has increased opportunities for job seekers to train  and upskill to become more employable in areas of high skill demand. Additional flexibility  has been introduced so that a job seeker who is studying an eligible course that is less than 12  months in duration, in either the vocational education and training or higher education  systems, can have that study counted towards their mutual obligation requirements.

The Government recognises this continues to be a challenging time for those looking for  work and encourages jobseekers to access the full range of assistance available to them -  including access to skills training, assistance for other work preparation activities and referral  to relevant support services - including mental health services, if required.

People in Victoria who are receiving both JobSeeker and JobKeeper payments may also have  mutual obligation requirements, depending on their circumstances, consistent with the  arrangements for part time workers who are also in receipt of Job Seeker. Individuals who  only receive JobKeeper are not subject to mutual obligation requirements.

Job seekers will be notified of their requirements ahead of the 23 November resumption.

Special Circumstances Exemptions continue to be available through Services Australia for  job seekers who require them. Sole traders and those who are self-employed will continue to  be exempted from requirements to allow them to work to re-establish their business.

Consistent with arrangements put in place over recent years to ensure jobseekers do not  receive payment suspensions over the Christmas and New Year period, mutual obligation  requirements for all jobseekers nationwide will be lifted between 21 December 2020 and                  3 January 2021 inclusive.
