MORRISON IGNORES REPORTS THAT COULD HAVE PREVENTED

TRAGEDIES IN VICTORIAN NURSING HOMES



Scott Morrison failed to progress key reports that could have prevented the

disastrous and tragic events that have unfolded in Victoria’s nursing homes.



On Wednesday Scott Morrison said the complete withdrawal of a workforce at

an aged care facility that has led to such tragic circumstances in Victoria could

not have been ‘anticipated or foreshadowed’.



But it did happen - just a year ago at the Earle Haven nursing home on the

Gold Coast.



What’s worse, the Morrison Government had a report they commissioned on

how to manage this very situation which it has failed to implement despite

accepting the report’s recommendations.



“The Department of Health should develop a response plan for emerging

situations where there is risk of an imminent collapse in the provision of aged

care services (the plan). The plan should include provision for rapid access to

resources to assist in stabilising service provision. The plan should be

communicated to all aged care providers to encourage early notification to the

Commonwealth and to state/ territory governments.”



Â·         RECOMMENDATION 21, INQUIRY INTO EVENTS AT EARLE HAVEN,

OCTOBER 2019



A separate report the Morrison Government has had for more than two years

on building the aged care workforce that could have helped prevent tragedies in

Victoria has also been ignored.



The lack of action has been slammed by the very person the Morrison

Government commissioned to write this report.



“They have known about these issues … There's plenty of reports that have

told them, but they have ducked it. It wasn't really until the Royal Commission

in November, it really became very clear that the Government has made no

progress. They've sat on the report.”



Â·         PROFESSOR JOHN POLLAERS, THE HERALD SUN, 31 JULY 2020



The Prime Minister’s failure to progress these reports is shocking and tragic.

The Prime Minister must accept responsibility for this failure.



The growing list of Morrison Government failures in preparing for COVID-19 in

aged care and responding to outbreaks is deeply concerning.



We have seen the devastating impact of COVID-19 outbreaks in aged care in

Australia and across the globe.





Why was the Morrison Government not better prepared for outbreaks that

would impact our nation’s most vulnerable?



Australia’s aged care system was broken before the COVID-19 pandemic and

this is only putting extra stress on the system.
