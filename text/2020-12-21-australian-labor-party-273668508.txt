CHRIS BOWEN MP

SHADOW MINISTER FOR HEALTH

MEMBER FOR MCMAHON





HUNT HIKES HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS JUST DAYS FROM

CHRISTMAS



Greg Hunt’s decision to rubber-stamp private health insurance premium increases

just days before Christmas is a blow for Australian families.



The Minister has today announced a 2.74 per cent average increase in 2021 - with

some funds and policies set to rise by much more.



Hunt’s hike is well above projected inflation, and will cost families an extra $126 on

average.



Greg Hunt promised private health insurance reform - but all he’s delivered is

silence and premium hikes.



Today’s announcement brings total increases under the Coalition to 36 per cent,

and follows the ACCC’s recent finding that insurers have paid out $500 million less

in benefits due to COVID-19.



With premiums soaring and benefits falling, it’s no wonder that health insurance

coverage is already at its lowest level in decades - and today’s announcement will

only add to the pressure.



Greg Hunt must now urgently justify his Christmas ‘present’ to Australian families.





The Private Health Insurance Act gives the Minister the power to reject premium

increases that “would be contrary to the public interest”.



The Minister must explain why another 2.74 per cent average increase next year is

in the public interest - or cancel it altogether.
