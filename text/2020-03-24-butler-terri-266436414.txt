SHADOW MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND WATER  MEMBER FOR GRIFFITH



MORRISON GOVERNMENT'S CANCELLED WATER BRIEFINGS MUST BE  REPLACED WITH ONLINE ALTERNATIVES

The Morrison Government must replace any cancelled annual briefings on water  allocations with online alternatives, to ensure our farmers get the information they need.

Labor’s Shadow Minister for the Environment and Water Terri Butler said it is crucial that  the Government provides clear communication to our farmers and Murray Darling  communities, particularly at a time when so much uncertainty exists because of the  COVID-19 pandemic.

“Strong and clear communication is key to maintaining public confidence during times of  crisis. Information about water security is central to Australia’s capacity to ensure food  security,” Ms Butler said.

“COVID-19 poses challenges for public communication, but it is not an excuse to cancel  public explanations of government decisions.

“Our farmers and regional communities deserve clear information and explanations about  the decisions being made about water supply in the Murray Darling Basin.

“The Morrison Government has already allowed a crisis of confidence to develop in the  Murray Darling Basin through a lack of transparency, integrity and accountability.

“In an unprecedented health crisis that affects all of us, we can only get through it by  working together, which includes supporting the work of our farmers and regional  communities.

“Australians need leadership and clear, consistent information from the Government,” Ms  Butler said.
