UPDATE ON CORONAVIRUS MEASURES

Australian governments met today as the National Cabinet to take further action to slow the spread of  coronavirus to save lives, and to save livelihoods.

We will be living with this virus for at least six months, so social distancing measures to slow this virus  down must be sustainable for at least that long to protect Australian lives, to help Australia to keep  functioning and to keep Australians in jobs.

National Cabinet noted the latest statistics and medical advice in relation to COVID-19.

There are more than 3,000 confirmed cases in Australia and sadly 13 people have died. Of the newly  reported cases in the last week, the majority have been from New South Wales, Queensland and  Victoria.

National Cabinet noted that the vast majority (around 85%) of cases in Australia remain overseas  acquired or locally acquired contacts of a confirmed case.

Testing keeps Australians safe. Australia has one of the most rigorous coronavirus testing systems in the  world with more than 180,000 tests completed - more than the USA, France or the UK, which have much  larger populations. Australia’s per capita testing rate is amongst the highest in the world, now  surpassing South Korea.

Intensive Care Units (ICU) will be critically important to protect the health of Australians. National  Cabinet noted that Commonwealth, states and territories are working on increasing ICU and ventilator  capacity - with surge capacity being prepared in the case of outbreaks.

National Cabinet received a comprehensive economic update from Treasury Secretary Dr Steven  Kennedy. It noted the Commonwealth and states and territories have implemented major new  economic support packages, but that even with these packages it is expected there will still be  significant impacts on unemployment and economic activity.

National Cabinet thanked all Australians who are adhering to social distancing and self-isolation  arrangements. Hygiene, social isolation and contact tracing are our most important measures to reduce  the spread of the virus. We recognise this is a distressing time for Australians and we must stand  together to ensure that we support each other.

We will continue to look at further measures as and where necessary to protect Australians. Any further  measures to restrict activity may need to be flexible and calibrated to the extent of outbreaks by  jurisdiction and the impact on the wellbeing of Australians and economics activity. Our goal is to start  businesses and economic again after this health crisis has ended

National Cabinet will meet again on Sunday, 29 March 2020 and consider issues including responses to  address. Commercial and residential tenancies and health  supply arrangements



Returning Travellers

Substantial numbers of returned travellers and small community outbreaks associated with travellers  continue to contribute most of the significant further growth in COVID-19 cases in Australia.

In order to help drive down this concerning number of imported cases, National Cabinet has agreed to  take action to further restrict the movement of incoming travellers and to increase compliance checks  on travellers who are already undertaking their mandatory self-isolation period at home. This is about  reducing the spread of the virus in Australia and saving lives

National Cabinet agreed that:  1. As soon as possible, but no later than 11:59pm Saturday 28 March 2020, all travellers  arriving in Australia will be required to undertake their mandatory 14 day self-isolation at  designated facilities (for example, a hotel).

a. Travellers will be transported directly to designated facilities after appropriate  immigration, customs and enhanced health checks.  b. Designated facilities will be determined by the relevant state or territory  government and will ordinarily be in the city of entry where the traveller has cleared

immigration, but facilities in other areas may be used if required.  c. These requirements will be implemented under state and territory legislation and  will be enforced by state and territory governments, with the support of the

Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the Australian Border Force (ABF) where  necessary.  d. The Commonwealth will provide support through the ABF and ADF for these  arrangements across Australia, and that states and territories would meet the costs

and determine any contributions required for travellers arriving within their  jurisdictions.  e. Air and maritime crews will be required to continue to undertake the existing  precautions they are following where they self-isolate in their accommodation if

they enter Australia until their next work voyage.  2. The Australian Defence Force will begin assisting state and territory governments to undertake  quarantine compliance checks of those who are required to be in mandatory isolation after  returning from overseas.

a. ADF personnel will bolster local police efforts in visiting the homes and residences of  Australians who are in mandatory isolation as directed by state and territory  governments and will report to the local police whether the identified individual was at  the residence.

ADF assistance will be provided under the Defence Assistance to the Civil Community arrangements.

These new requirements will build on the existing support the Australian Defence Force is providing to  the COVID-19 response, including:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Assistance to the states and territories to support contact tracing efforts.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Supporting industry with the production of surgical masks.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Provision of planning and logistics support to Commonwealth, state and territory agencies.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Provision of personnel to other agencies, including Services Australia.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Supporting the NT Police with border control operations.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Assisting states and territories to support the production of food hampers to supply to

isolated civilians.





Statement on Schools by the National Cabinet

It is no longer business as usual for our schools, as we adapt to the impact of COVID-19.

We are now in a transition phase until the end of term as schools prepare for a new mode of operation  following the school holidays.

For principals, teachers and support staff, the next few months will bring incredible challenges for our  education system. We understand they need time to engage in the professional preparation and  planning that is required to ensure that every child has access to education during this difficult time in a  sustainable and effective manner for the rest of the 2020 school year.

Some states and territories have moved to pupil-free days already and each state and territory will come  to their own transition arrangements with their workforce for the rest of this term.

While the medical advice remains that it is safe for children to go to school, to assist with the transition  underway in our schools to the new mode of operation we ask that only children of workers for whom  no suitable care arrangements are available at home to support their learning, physically attend school.  This is vital to ensure that no parent should be forced to choose between their employment and the  children’s education.

We understand the need for clear, nationally consistent health and safety advice so we have asked the  AHPPC to develop guidelines about how staff in schools can protect themselves, manage social distance  requirements and cater for those students who are at school. This will include guidelines for staff who  work with vulnerable children, particularly those who have additional needs.

For education staff who identify as high risk, vulnerable or are caring for vulnerable family members,  you will be supported to work from home.

We will continue to meet with education stakeholders and unions so that we can understand the  education challenges for our communities and work constructively towards solutions. That will include  the National Cabinet’s consideration of the measures needed for early childhood settings and TAFE.



Partnering with private hospitals

National Cabinet agreed to the importance of a strong and viable private hospital sector to bolster  Australia’s response to COVID-19.

State and territory governments committed to urgently finalise arrangements with private hospitals  under the COVID-19 National Partnership Agreement by 29 March 2020, to ensure sufficient and viable  capacity exists within the private hospital sector both through the COVID-19 response and on an  ongoing basis.

The private hospital system can play an important role in supporting the acute and intensive care needs  of infected Australians together with other continuing urgent care needs. The capacity of the private  system for non COVID cases and for overflow, particularly from ICU facilities, may be critical to  Australia’s response.
