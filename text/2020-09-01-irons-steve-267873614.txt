ADULT LEARNERS WEEK 2020: A CHANCE TO REFRESH AND  RESKILL

It’s never too late to learn and Adult Learners Week 2020, which kicks off today, will help  people find new skills in a rapidly changing labour market.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said people could connect with adult education providers that offer a range of learning  pathways.

“This is the 25th year Adult Learners Week has been celebrated in Australia and the theme  ‘renew you’ encourages people to take stock and look into the new possibilities available  through adult education,” Minister Cash said.

“Adult Learners Week activities and events can set people on the path of deciding where to  start and the right organisations to contact.

“The Morrison Government is a strong advocate for adult education and reconnecting with  learning has never been more important.”

Assistant Minister for Vocational Education, Training and Apprenticeships, the Hon Steve  Irons MP, said as Australia continues its economic recovery from COVID-19, we are  supporting people to transition between jobs and train for the jobs of tomorrow.

“The Morrison Government has invested over $3.3 billion in skills since the onset of  COVID-19, to give hundreds of thousands of Australians access to retraining and upskilling  in sectors with job opportunities,” Assistant Minister Irons said.

“We are spearheading the new JobTrainer Fund, with $500 million from the Australian  Government, matched dollar-for-dollar with the states and territories, providing around  340,700 additional training places.

“This presents a real opportunity for adult learners to reskill or upskill to improve their  employment prospects.”

Adult Learners Week runs from 1-8 September and offers events around Australia, including  online. For more information about activities and virtual events visit: adultlearnersweek.org
