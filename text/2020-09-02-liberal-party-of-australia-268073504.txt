Thank you to our early childhood educators

Minister for Education Dan Tehan has acknowledged the extraordinary commitment of  Australia’s early childhood educators who continue to support families through the   COVID-19 pandemic.

Mr Tehan said the early childhood sector has provided vital education and care for our  children in unprecedented times.

“This year has brought many challenges and uncertainties for families, but early childhood  educators have always been there for our children and communities across the country,”   Mr Tehan said.

“Today on Early Childhood Educators’ Day we recognise and celebrate the crucial work of  our early learning educators.

“They make a wonderful contribution to the wellbeing and healthy development of the young  children in their care, and are unsung heroes for many parents, particularly those essential  workers.

“I encourage parents, families and communities across Australia to let educators know how  much they are appreciated, and to say thanks for their dedication to the children in their  care.”
