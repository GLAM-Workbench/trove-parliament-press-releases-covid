FEDS SHOULD USE NAIF TO LIFT NORTHERN AUSTRALIA’S ECONOMY

Labor is calling on the Morrison Government to use its idle $5 billion Northern Australia  Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) to provide further economic stimulus to Northern Australia in  the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

Many parts of Northern Australia were already suffering above average unemployment and  have now been hit hard by coronavirus.

At a time when our north is hurting, the Government must take every action possible to  support the region’s workers and businesses.

When the $5 billion NAIF was announced in 2015, the Government claimed it would create  jobs and boost investment in Northern Australia. Sadly, that hasn’t happened.

Nearly five years on, only $88.5 million has been released for projects in Northern  Australia, less than two per cent in total funding. In Queensland, less than $2 million has  been released.

With the collapse in tourism, retail and other industries, we are seeing regional centres  across Northern Australia among the hardest hit.

Places like Cairns, which normally have a thriving tourism industry, are seeing businesses  closing and hundreds of jobs lost. It needs support urgently.

This funding for Northern Australia has been locked up for far too long. It’s time the  Government and the NAIF delivered on its promise.
