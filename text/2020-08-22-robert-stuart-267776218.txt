NDIS update for Queensland



The Minister for the NDIS, Stuart Robert, has today announced temporary changes in response to the  Queensland Government’s new Disability Accommodation Services Direction.

Temporary changes in restricted areas of Queensland include allowing:

Ã¯ÂÂ· NDIS participants to claim the cost of personal protective equipment (PPE), including masks,  for use when a worker is with them

Ã¯ÂÂ· NDIS providers to directly claim the costs of PPE for workers from the National Disability  Insurance Agency (NDIA)

‘Today the Federal Government is taking proactive steps to support the disability sector in  Queensland, as part of the Government wider plan to support the disability sector through the  coronavirus pandemic’ Minister Robert said.

‘Our focus is squarely on ensuring the disability sector in Queensland has what it needs to keep people  safe and ensure the continuity of essential disability supports,’

‘We know that participants who receive face-to-face supports may be at higher risk of transmission,  with daily support from their workers regularly involving close physical contact,’

‘We’re extending the temporary measures already in place in Victoria and New South Wales, so  participants, their support workers and providers in restricted areas of Queensland can continue to  provide essential disability supports in a COVID safe environment.’

From today, NDIS participants in restricted areas of Queensland who rely on face-to-face supports and  assistance with their daily living will be able to use an existing support item (Low Cost Disability-Related Health Consumables) to claim on the cost of PPE for their own use at times their worker is  with them.

The changes will also see providers in restricted areas of Queensland able to claim an allowance of  $1.70 per hour of support delivered in the Activities of Daily Life Support Category, to cover the cost  of PPE for workers, directly from the NDIA. This will ensure participant plan funds are not impacted  by the use of PPE by their providers and workers.

Providers will be able to claim for costs that they have incurred for delivering daily living supports  since the Queensland Government’s new Disability Accommodation Services Direction came into  effect at 8am on 22 August 2020.

Impacted Queensland providers will be contacted over the coming days with further detail on the new  way of claiming for PPE.

Today’s announcement is in addition to existing NDIS initiatives that are available nationally:

Ã¯ÂÂ· In situations where there is a known positive case of COVID-19, participants and providers can  access $300 in funding for deep-cleaning

Ã¯ÂÂ· SIL providers can claim up to $1,200 per day for higher intensity supports to cover situations  where there is a positive, or potential positive, COVID-19 case of a participant and they are  required to self-isolate or quarantine

Ã¯ÂÂ· Participants who live in SIL and non-SIL arrangements now have access to additional  Assistance with Daily Living (ADL) and Short Term Accommodation (STA) funding as  needed when quarantining or self-isolating

Ã¯ÂÂ· Disability providers and self-managed NDIS participants are also able to request access to PPE  from the National Medical Stockpile by contacting NDISCOVIDPPE@health.gov.au, where  they cannot acquire the equipment they need through their usual channels, with 1.5 million  masks allocated for the disability sector.

Further information on funding of PPE and other initiatives can be found at www.ndis.gov.au.
