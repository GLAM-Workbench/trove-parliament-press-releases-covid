NOW IS THE TIME FOR GOVERNMENT TO BACK IN OUR AVIATION  SECTOR

Australia has the most effective domestic aviation system in the world, serving us all with  distinction for 100 years.

Our airlines, airports and associated companies are comprised of hundreds of thousands  of highly-skilled, dedicated Australians.

The Federal Opposition is confident that our aviation sector is resilient and it will bounce  back once the Coronavirus outbreak passes.

We welcomed the relief package to the airlines announced on Tuesday this week, but  made clear that more support to the aviation sector was needed.

With conditions rapidly changing and no end in sight, I have written to the Deputy Prime  Minister requesting the Federal Government step up efforts to support our aviation sector.

The CEO of Virgin, Paul Scurrah, has said it’s important to discuss the need for further  government support now:

“Everybody in our industry may need further government support.”

Regional Express Airlines said in a statement the aviation support package did not go far  enough:

“Rex is disappointed that the package does not include a sovereign guarantee of new  loans taken up by regional carriers to tide them through the period of extreme negative  cash flow until normalcy returns and we are hopeful that this will be adopted in a second  stage of assistance.”

The Federal Government must publicly commit to working with the aviation sector and  urgently outline a clear path forward to ensure that current structure of the airline industry



is maintained beyond the current crisis.

Labor continues to play a constructive, responsible, supportive role during this outbreak  and that includes injecting a sense of urgency when it is lacking or absent.
