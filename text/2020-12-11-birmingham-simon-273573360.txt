Recognising Australia’s remarkable exporters

Australia’s innovative exporters and investors have today been recognised for the  contribution they make to our economy at the online Remarkable Australian Exporters’  Showcase.

The recognition program highlights hundreds of stories submitted by Australian exporters  showcasing their ability to adapt to the challenges of 2020 in creative and inspiring ways.

Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Simon Birmingham said the recognition program  was a unique opportunity to acknowledge the enormous contribution our exporters make to  the economy and to creating more jobs.

“This year has been like no other for Australia’s 53 000 exporters. This is about recognising  and celebrating our exporters the incredible resilience they have shown in the face of major  disruptions brought on by COVID-19,” Minister Birmingham said.

“Exporters from across Australia have had to find new ways to engage in the trading  environment by embracing technology, developing new products or rethinking their operating  models.

“The stories of these exporters cover a breadth of talent and ingenuity from premium goods,  manufacturing and health services to creative arts and software development.

“After an incredibly tough year for, I’m delighted to recognise our remarkable exporters and  the enormous contribution they make to our economy and the millions of jobs they support.”

Eight exporting businesses from across Australia were chosen to feature in the online  exporters’ showcase, from a field of 340 businesses:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Summernats (ACT);  Ã¯ÂÂ· Flavourtech (NSW);  Ã¯ÂÂ· Darwin Aboriginal Art Fair Foundation (DAAFF) (NT);  Ã¯ÂÂ· Icon Group (Qld);   Ã¯ÂÂ· Bec Hardy Wines (SA);   Ã¯ÂÂ· Novaris (TAS);  Ã¯ÂÂ· Care Essentials (VIC); and  Ã¯ÂÂ· Epichem (WA).



Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Investment, Andrew Gee said Australia’s  exporters were tackling the challenges of the COIVD-19 pandemic head on.

“Our exporters have demonstrated incredible strength and resilience this year, with many  taking risks, pivoting their business models and investing in new technology to remain  competitive.

“The Remarkable Australian Exporters’ Showcase is a great opportunity to recognise the  hard-work of our Aussie exporters and learn from their stories and experiences.

“The success of our exporters is critical to rebuilding and restoring confidence in Australia’s  economy - they spearhead our prosperity.

“We are committed to helping our exporters access new international markets and expand  their presence in existing markets, and Australians can do their bit too this festive season by  buying local and supporting great Aussie businesses.”

“I also acknowledge Accenture, Korea Zinc and Sledgehammer who received the Minister’s  Investment Awards in recognition of the positive contribution foreign direct investment makes  to the economy in creating jobs and driving innovation,” Minister Birmingham said.

The Australian Trade and Investment Commission and the Australian Chamber of  Commerce and Industry have run this year’s program that replaces the Australian Export  Awards.
