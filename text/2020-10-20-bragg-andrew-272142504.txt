Statement on Chinese Australians

17 October 2020

Chinese Australians have been magnificent patriots during the pandemic.

After Chinese New Year, they self isolated and protected the wider Australian community from

COVID-19.

The broader Australian family owes a great debt to Chinese Australians and we thank them for

their loyalty.

They certainly don’t need to put up with rubbish, unsophisticated commentary like “wuhan flu”.

I am looking forward to reconvening my Chinese-Australian advisory group in a fortnight to hear

their perspectives.
