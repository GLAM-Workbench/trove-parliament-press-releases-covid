SHOVELS TO HIT ROAD ON GOLD COAST INTERSECTION

Shovels will hit the ground next month on the $10.7 million upgrade to one of the Gold  Coast’s busiest intersections.

Start of construction on the Harbour Town intersection will spark 34 jobs for the city.

The intersection takes in the Brisbane Road & Gold Coast Highway, Oxley Drive & Hope  Island Road and Olsen Avenue & Labrador-Carrara Road.

It will include additional right-turn lanes on both directions of Brisbane Road and longer right-turn lanes on all four directions of the intersection.

Federal Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure Alan Tudge said the upgrade  would ease congestion and mean a safer trip for thousands of motorists.

“It’s part of our Urban Congestion Fund and Gold Coast drivers will soon be reaping the  benefits of this targeted investment,” Mr Tudge said.

“It also means local jobs and money into the Queensland economy, which is needed now  more than ever.”

Queensland Minister for Transport and Main Roads Mark Bailey said the upgrade would  tackle congestion, improve safety for thousands of drivers using the intersection every day  and provide a much-needed shot in the arm for local construction jobs.

“Announcements like today’s mean we’re getting on with the job of delivering for Gold Coast  families, businesses and industry,” Mr Bailey said.

“Across the globe, economies including Queensland’s have felt the brunt of COVID-19 but  because we’re managing those health impacts, we’re able to continue rolling out a record  $23 billion pipeline of transport and road upgrades to create jobs throughout Queensland and  on the coast.

“This project adds to more than $2.3 billion in M1 upgrades, Stage 3A of the light rail,  planning for the Coomera Connector and already completed projects like the Coomera to  Helensvale rail duplication and $160 million in Gold Coast road upgrades.”

Federal Member for Fadden Stuart Robert said the upgrade would benefit cyclists and  pedestrians as well as motorists.



“When works are complete, new pedestrian fences will provide greater safety for the general  public and additional cycle lanes will connect to local roads through the intersection,”  Mr Robert said.

“The local community will receive a project flyer in the coming days and further community  consultation will be undertaken as the project progresses.”

The project is jointly funded with the Australian Government committing $5 million and the  Queensland Government $5.68 million.
