THE MORRISON GOVERNMENT’S COVER-UP COMMISSION

The Morrison Government has proposed a weak, secretive and compromised  model clearly designed to allow the Government to pretend it is acting to  address corruption while ensuring it could never be held accountable for its  multiple scandals.

Labor was not consulted on the proposal outlined today. It’s a lengthy bill and  we will need to review it carefully.

But it’s already clear that the legislation essentially reflects the original proposal  put forward by the Government almost two years ago.

This is a commission that would be unable to instigate its own independent  inquiries other than in very limited circumstances, that would be unable to hold  public hearings when a corruption investigation relates to politicians or public  servants and may even be prevented from investigating any of the multiple past  scandals of the Morrison Government.

Mr Porter has repeatedly blamed the COVID crisis for his refusal to make public  the draft bill.

But evidence last week revealed Mr Porter has been sitting on this since  December last year.

Today’s draft bill confirms the Morrison Government has no interest in integrity  or fighting corruption and was using the COVID-crisis as an excuse to hide its  weak and ineffective commission from the Australian public.

The ever-growing list of scandals surrounding the Morrison Government shows  why Australia needs a powerful and independent Audit Office, and a powerful  and independent National Integrity Commission - and why Mr Morrison and his



colleagues will do everything in their power to crush both of them.
