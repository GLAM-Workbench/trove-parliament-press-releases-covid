MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS LIFTED   UNTIL CONGESTION CLEARS



The Coronavirus has, and will continue to have, a devastating impact on Australian jobs and  businesses.

Due to the high demand on government services, jobseekers have experienced difficulty with  reporting their mutual obligations.

During this challenging time, the Morrison Government is lifting all mutual obligation  requirements for jobseekers until capacity can be restored to the MyGov website.

Requirements will be lifted until 31 March, 2020, however if congestion continues, the  Government will consider extending these arrangements.

What this means is that no one will be penalised for not being able to report their attendance  at appointments or activities - no oneâ€™s payments will be suspended and no compliance  action will be taken.

The Morrison Government remains committed to mutual obligations and their success with  jobseekers and believes in the importance of Australians continued connection to the  workforce during this difficult time.
