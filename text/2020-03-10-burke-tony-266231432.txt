CASUALS NEED SUPPORT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER



Australia’s 3.3 million casual workers need urgent reassurance they will be

supported if they can’t work because of coronavirus.



If casuals aren’t given that reassurance sooner rather than later we run the risk

people will turn up to work when they’re sick because they simply cannot afford

to stay home and lose their pay.



This isn’t just about supporting Australia’s often vulnerable or insecure casual

workers - it’s about containing the spread of this virus.



We have already seen examples of people who have been advised to

quarantine themselves because of coronavirus fears turning up at work

because it is the only way they can pay the bills.





We welcome Christian Porter’s meeting with unions and employer groups today

but note there were no concrete outcomes.



The Government must not drag its feet on this.



The conservative government in the UK has already made changes to sick

leave rules to make sure people have income if they are in isolation - and Scott

Morrison should be activating similar measures.



The Government also needs to immediately suspend the activity and mutual

obligation requirements of anyone on social security who is required to self-isolate or go into quarantine.



People should not fear their payment will be cut off if they follow medical advice

and stay home.
