Commission starts work with manufacturers to supply essential products  Commissioners with the newly formed National COVID-19 Coordination Commission, Greg Combet AM and Catherine Tanna,  are working with manufacturers to ensure supply of essential products, such as personal protective equipment, and solve  supply chain issues to keep critical goods flowing to Australian communities.

Commissioner Combet said the Commission is working to solve immediate supply priorities with manufacturers and is  advising government on solutions.

“I’m focused on urgent issues and how industry can re-tool very quickly to adapt and respond to our current situation,  including manufacturing medical supplies and critical products in Australia,” Mr Combet said.

“We're working very closely with the manufacturing companies and each state and territory on opportunities to gear up  across the country and meet current demands.”

The Commission has also asked global businessman Andrew Liveris AO to work with industry leaders to identify specific  opportunities for growth in manufacturing once Australia moves into the recovery stage.

Working through the Commission, the group will provide advice on priority recommendations to government on future  opportunities for manufacturing in Australia.

The working group includes:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Innes Willox, AiGroup

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ James Fazzino and Ben Eade, Manufacturing Australia

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Jens Goennemann, Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Paul Bastian, Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union

The Commission is being led by Mr Neville Power and supported by an Executive Board of Directors drawn from across the  business and not-for-profit sectors comprising: Mr Greg Combet AM, Ms Jane Halton AO, Mr Paul Little AO, Ms Catherine  Tanna, and Mr David Thodey.

The Commission has two key roles: to help minimise and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on jobs and businesses, and to  facilitate the fastest recovery possible once the virus has passed.
