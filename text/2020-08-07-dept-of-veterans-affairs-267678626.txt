HOST BROADCAST

On Saturday 15th August 2020 at 10:00am the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in  association with the Australian Government Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) is providing  a host broadcast feed of:

75th Anniversary of the End of the Second World War commemoration

Location: Australian War Memorial, Treloar Cres Canberra

Please note - this event will be closed to the public and media due to COVID-19 restrictions.

DETAILS:

The ABC will provide a television feed available in HD via Telstra Dimetis. This  feed will not be available in SD. Receiving parties who are unable to take a HD  feed will need to make alternative arrangements for down-conversion to SD  through an external intermediary of their choosing.

The television feed will be a complete Program and is ‘brand free’.  The program will also  include an ABC closing copyright.  The broadcast will have a wide shot up prior to  commencement of the service at 10:00:00 AEST. At the end of the service it will go back to the  wide shot for 5 seconds before the ABC closing copyright logo to allow time for anyone taking  the broadcast live to get out. A clean feed (with no titles, or supers), of the Service will be  available (in HD), from the back of the OB van should you require it. This would need to be  organised at least 2 hours before the service starts

There is no radio feed available for the service but an audio split for radio use can be made  available by ABC Radio Master Control in Sydney.

The host broadcast will be provided free of charge to accredited media, where it is  requested.

The broadcast is available in HD and will have a TV stereo audio mix on tracks 1 & 2 and listen  only Director talk back on track 4.
