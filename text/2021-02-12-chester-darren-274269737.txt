GRANTS SUPPORT COMMEMORATING OUR MILITARY HISTORY

APPLICATIONS for the 2021-22 Saluting Their Service Commemorative Grants Program are now  open and organisations are encouraged to apply for funding to support their commemorative  projects and activities.

Minister for Veterans’ Affairs Darren Chester said the program, now in its 25th year had supported  thousands of projects nationally, but there were more projects across the nation still to be done.

“At the heart of commemoration is our communities and these grants will continue to provide the  extra assistance that many need in order to remember their local wartime history and service  personnel,” Mr Chester said.

“Projects and activities that these grants have supported include developing digital databases of  Australians who have served, restoring commemorative sites of significance and producing  resources that will keep the stories of our veterans alive for generations to come.

“I am proud to see that so many community groups and organisations have applied for funding in  past years, and that each year we continue to see high numbers of applications, a trend I look  forward to seeing carry on in 2021.”

The Grant Opportunity Guidelines have been revised for 2021-22, with changes made following  consultation with ex-service organisations.

“It is important that we continually review what and how we are doing things and make  improvements - the Grant Opportunity Guidelines are a perfect example of this,” Mr Chester said.

“In 2021-22 we are making minor changes to these guidelines; they will also include more  information around coronavirus support and new batch opening and closing dates. It is important  that you read these guidelines before you apply.”

For more information, including access to the latest guidelines and information on how to apply, visit  the Community Grants Hub.
