MORE EVIDENCE HOMEBUILDER IS NOT ENOUGH

Up to 42,000 Australians who work in the construction industry will lose their jobs this  financial year, according to the Australian Construction Industry Forum.

Updated forecasts reveal that the construction industry, which employs one in ten  Australian workers, “is still being hammered by COVID downturn” and construction of  houses and apartments will not return to peak pre-pandemic levels until the middle of the  decade.

This should not come as a surprise to the Morrison Government.

For months, the construction industry and Treasury have warned residential construction  will fall this financial year and when fewer homes are built, jobs will be lost.

All of these forecasts from Treasury and the construction industry factor in the  HomeBuilder Scheme.

This new report is more evidence that HomeBuilder is too small to stop tradies in the  housing construction industry from losing their jobs.

The scheme needs to be extended but this alone is not enough. More needs to be done to  save tradie jobs.

When private demand for housing drops it makes sense for government to invest more in  social housing.

Instead, the Morrison Government has ignored a stack of warnings* from housing industry,  Treasury and Labor to invest more money in social housing.

For every dollar invested in construction, three dollars is created for the broader economy.  We are in a recession - this investment makes sense.

Labor has repeatedly called on the Morrison Government to put together a comprehensive  housing stimulus plan, which should include investing half a billion dollars to fast-track  urgent repairs to social housing. This would create work for thousands of tradies in almost  every suburb and town.

Repairs could start almost immediately, providing work for local plumbers, chippies,  sparkies, plasterers and painters as well as companies that manufacture building supplies  and materials. This would also provide opportunities for apprentices.
