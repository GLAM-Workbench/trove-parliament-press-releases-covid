FUNDING SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY   2019 QUEENSLAND BUSHFIRES

Grants of up to $100,000 are now available for community groups, local councils and non-government organisations in 23 communities impacted by the bushfires last year.

Minister for Emergency Management David Littleproud said applications were now open  for the second round of flexible funding grants, with a total of $4.2 million available for  bushfire affected communities.

“We know that the communities impacted by devastating bushfires in the spring and  summer of 2019 are continuing to rebuild their lives and recover as a community,” Minister  Littleproud said.

“The flexible funding grants are available for programs and projects that will support local  communities through their long-term recovery.

“The Australian and Queensland Governments will continue to support impacted  communities on their recovery journey from the bushfires,” he said.

Queensland Minister for Housing and Communities Leeanne Enoch said the $4.2 million  funding round follows on from the first round of flexible funding grants, which provided $1.8  million to 37 projects across Queensland.

“Some of the projects that received funding in the first round included a community  disaster recovery hub and animal refuge at Mount Larcom, a community bushfire  preparation project in Toowoomba and improvements to the Baffle Creek Community  Centre,” Minister Enoch said.

“Small grants of between $2,500 and $50,000 and larger grants of up to $100,000 are now  available,” she said.

The flexible funding grants are open to community groups, local councils and non-government organisations in the local government areas:
