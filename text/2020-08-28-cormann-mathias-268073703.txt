ADVANCES TO THE FINANCE MINISTER   IN THE WEEK ENDING FRIDAY 28 AUGUST 2020



This week I made $230.1 million in additional funding available to support the Governmentâ€™s  response to the COVID 19 pandemic by using the Advance to the Finance Minister (the  AFM).

The determination provided $230.1 million to the Australian Trade and Investment  Commission to extend the International Freight Assistance Mechanism (IFAM) to 31  December 2020.  The IFAM supports exporters of premium and perishable agricultural  produce by underwriting domestic and international airfreight connectivity.

The determination was made from the AFM that was appropriated by the Parliament in  Supply Act (No. 2) 2020-2021.

The determination was signed on 24 August 2020.

This determination was registered on the Federal Register of Legislation, together with an  Explanatory Statement (these are available at legislation.gov.au).
