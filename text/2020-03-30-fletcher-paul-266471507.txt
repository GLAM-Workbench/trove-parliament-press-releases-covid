Useful telecommunications tips for working from home in the ‘Keeping  Australia Connected’ resource

Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher MP, today  welcomed the ‘Keeping Australians Connected’ resource launched by the Australian  telecommunications sector, through peak bodies Communications Alliance and the Australian Mobile  Telecommunications Association (AMTA).

This document contains many practical tips for Australians working from home including:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If your call does not go through, consider setting your mobile handset to make Wi-Fi calls  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Schedule video conferences to start at times other than on the hour or the half hour  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Download and upload large files outside of peak times wherever possible.



This resource also explains what is happening in our telecommunications networks, with daytime  traffic on the NBN up around 70 per cent, and on mobile networks up to 40 per cent.

“Over the course of a few weeks, we’ve seen a significant and rapid shift towards remote working as  Australians respond to COVID-19 social distancing measures. This has led to a substantial increase  in demand on Australia’s telecommunications networks,” Minister Fletcher said.

“Australia’s telco sector is working hard to keep our networks running and to meet the needs of  Australians as so many of us work or study from home at this difficult time.

“The Morrison Government is engaging closely with the sector as they do this vital work.”

The Keeping Australians Connected resource will be regularly updated by Communications Alliance  and AMTA, so it remains a reliable source of advice for Australian telecommunications users.

KEEPING AUSTRALIA CONNECTED - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY

Australia’s communication networks - responding to COVID-19

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Demands on telecommunications networks in Australian and internationally continue to  increase substantially due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, particularly as more people are now  working from home and education is being moved online. The whole profile of daily demand  on networks has changed, with much more traffic being carried throughout the daylight hours  and in non-CBD areas than previously.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Telcos are working closely with Government and each other to ensure that Australia stays  connected. There has been some disruption at times to some types of voice services - for  example to some Government sites that use 1800, 13 or 1300 numbers and where demand has  skyrocketed.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ So far there has been no widespread impacts on data services, such as broadband.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ All providers are working hard to minimise any disruptions and maintain our vital  communication networks, including the provisioning of extra capacity wherever the risk of  congestion becomes apparent. This includes Triple Zero and other emergency service  communications.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ While Telcos will keep stores open where possible and in accordance with social distancing  policies; there will be some retail closures and/or reduced staffing levels. We strongly  encourage customers to first try online self-service options and check providers’ websites for  up-to-date information before heading to a store.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It is also recommended to explore the self-service and online options - including interactive  chat and customer forums - to interact with your service provider and get advice, rather than  calling the customer service number. Providers’ call centres are under higher than usual  pressure at present and you may experience longer wait times.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Another issue has been the imposition of major COVID-19 lock-downs in some offshore  countries, including places that provide IT and/or customer service and technical support for  Australian service providers. In some cases, this has disrupted the migration of some Australian  services - i.e. when a customer is moving their service from one provider to a different  provider. These issues are being addressed by the industry as a matter of the highest priority.

Support is available for customers:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Many providers are offering free additional or unlimited data or other features in this crisis.  This is helpful for people who find themselves working from home.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Providers have Financial Hardship assistance available, and many are offering additional help  such as temporarily waiving late payment fees.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Check your provider’s website to see what’s available and how to access it. And again, try to  use self-help tools as much as possible.

Tips for customers:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If you are experiencing congestion or other issues and your call is not urgent, consider if you  can wait and try again later.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If you have difficulty making a voice call via a mobile network and you have access to Wi-Fi  calling, try that to see if it works better for you.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If you are working from home, make sure you follow your employer’s advice about the best  ways to connect to your company’s network. Your employer will know the most effective  paths and applications for you to use to connect and enjoy a hassle-free experience.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ When you are scheduling audio/video group calls, choose a start time that is 10, 20, 40 or 50  minutes past the hour, to ease dial-in congestion.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Consider recommending audio-only options, to reduce the data volume of a group call/meeting.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Avoid downloading/uploading large files (including movies) during peak times, which now  also include daytime hours. For example, it can make a big difference if you can plan ahead  and download a movie or other large file between 9pm and 9am.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If you have a choice of image quality, choose standard definition over HD or 4k.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Before trying to contact your provider by phone, please try accessing online self-help tools  where possible.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ And last but not least - try to be patient. Telcos and their staff are doing their very best in these  difficult times.
