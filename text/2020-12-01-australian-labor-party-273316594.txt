TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE FOR OLDER AUSTRALIANS WHO TRAGICALLY  DIED IN AGED CARE

The Morrison Government’s response to the Aged Care Royal Commission’s special report  on COVID-19 is too little, too late.

Nothing will bring back the 685 older Australians who have tragically died in aged care  homes from COVID-19 and yesterday’s response isn’t enough to stop this happening  again.

The Royal Commission’s special report confirmed the Morrison Government had no plan  for COVID-19 in aged care and called for immediate action.

But the Government’s response makes it clear it has failed and is yet to fully implement all  the recommendations of the Aged Care Royal Commission’s special report.

This is true to form - the Morrison Government is always there for the photo op but never  the follow-up.

By its own admission, the Morrison Government confirmed it has not fully implemented key  recommendations on improving infection control in aged care. This is completely  unacceptable given the huge risks.

There is also no clear evidence that staffing has improved to allow for better visitation in  aged care homes.

We have seen the devastating consequences of the Morrison Government’s failure to not  prepare our aged care system for COVID-19.

Some families and loved ones were forced to say goodbye over Facetime.

Ants have been found crawling from wounds, with residents left to languish without care.

All because the Morrison Government failed to have a proper plan for COVID-19 in aged  care.

Shockingly the recent Budget had no significant new funding for residential aged care



where so many older Australians have died.

Neglect. That’s the legacy of this Government when it comes to aged care.

Australians deserve better.
