SCOTT MORRISON REFUSES TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS $1.7B  CUT TO AGED CARE

Despite nursing homes across the country crying out for more support to keep residents  safe from COVID-19 Scott Morrison refuses take responsibility for the cuts he made to  aged care as Treasurer.

Even before COVID-19 hit aged care, almost 200 nursing homes across the country were  on the brink of closure after Scott Morrison cut $1.7bIllion from aged care as Treasurer.

How can anyone trust this Government to fix Australia’s broken aged care system and  respond to threat of COVID-19 when Scott Morrison refuses to be honest?

Scott Morrison’s cuts to aged care are in black and white in his Budget papers.

He cut $1.2 billion from residential aged care in his first Budget as Treasurer - backing in a  $500 million cut in his first MYEFO.











This money went out of the aged care budget and didn’t come back. You don’t fix aged  care by cutting it.

Scott Morrison and the Liberals cannot be trusted to ensure older Australians get the aged  care services they need.

The Prime Minister and his Minister for Aged Care must be held to account for not better  preparing Australia’s aged care system for COVID-19.

Australians who have tragically been let down by Scott Morrison and his Minister for Aged  Care deserve answers.

The public needs to know that Mr Morrison has learnt from previous outbreaks and  everything possible is now being done.
