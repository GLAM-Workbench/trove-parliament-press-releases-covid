Supporting vulnerable and disadvantaged children during   COVID-19

The Morrison Government will provide an additional $5.2 million to help vulnerable and  disadvantaged children during COVID-19.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $4.4 million will be provided to help Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC)  services to support children with trauma-related behaviours or mental health  conditions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $860,000 will provide additional inclusion aids, such as mobility devices, specialised  inclusion toys, and communication tools to child care services through the Specialist  Equipment Library.

Minister for Education Dan Tehan said the additional funding recognised that children  needed extra support to help them navigate the coronavirus pandemic.

“COVID-19 is taking a toll on every Australian and we must continue to support each other  and also the most vulnerable members of our communities, especially our children,”   Mr Tehan said.

“Our Government is providing additional funding so children impacted by COVID-19 get  extra care to ensure they continue to get all-important early education.

“We are also providing more money to ensure children with disability can access tools and  resources that will help them be more engaged with their early childhood care.

“Parents and carers of children with additional needs will benefit from access to appropriate  and inclusive ECEC services, which in turn will free them up to increase their time working,  studying, or completing training.”

The additional funding is provided through the $133 million Inclusion Support component of  the Government’s Child Care Safety Net.

More information on the Inclusion Support Program can be found on the Department of  Education, Skills and Employment website.
