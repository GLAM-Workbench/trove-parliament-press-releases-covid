MEETING OF THE COAG DISABILITY REFORM COUNCIL

TELEPRESENCE - 18 MARCH 2020

COMMUNIQUÃÂ



The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Disability Reform Council (the Council) met  by telepresence today.

The meeting discussed a national response to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic,  particularly its potential impact on people with disability and the National Disability Insurance  Scheme (NDIS).

The Council acknowledged that COVID-19 presents a significant and unprecedented challenge  for people with disability, the people who care for them and the disability sector as a whole.

The Council noted the health and safety of participants, providers, paid and unpaid carers is a  key concern. The Council was briefed by Australian Government Department of Health officials  on health preparedness. The Council noted it is important that people take steps to protect  themselves and others, such as practising good hygiene, early self-isolation and social distancing  where practical. Information on what people can do to protect themselves and people they are  caring for is available at www.health.gov.au. People can also contact the Coronavirus Health  Information Line on 1800 020 080. The line operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The Council also noted it is important that, if someone suspects they or someone they know may  have contracted COVID-19, they seek medical help from a doctor or a hospital.

The Council acknowledged that some people with disability are more likely to be vulnerable to  the effects associated with COVID-19 and ensuring appropriate planning and preparedness  across the sector is a priority issue.

The Council considered the steps being taken jointly by the Department of Social Services,  National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) and the NDIS Quality and Safeguards  Commission (NDIS Commission), working with the Department of Health and states and  territories, to respond to COVID-19.

The Council agreed on the following priorities:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ensure appropriate consideration is given to people with disability and the disability  services sector in the health response, including access to telehealth, infection control  training and personal protective equipment.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ensure the ongoing delivery of core NDIA service delivery as part of the NDIA’s

Pandemic Plan, including the shift from face-to-face planning to telephone planning, and  the redirecting of NDIA staff and partners to priority service delivery roles that support  participants in response to COVID-19.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ensure the continuation of services to NDIS participants through the extension and  increased flexibility of NDIS plans where necessary so that the NDIA can focus on  reviewing plans that may require amendment in response to the impact of COVID-19.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ensure appropriate plans are in place to respond to any workforce shortages that may  arise as a result of COVID-19.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ensure providers are supported to remain viable during the period of impact of COVID-19 and beyond.

The Council noted specific measures to respond to these priorities will be finalised in coming  days and communicated directly to NDIS participants, their carers and providers.

The Council noted the importance of regular and consistent communication with NDIS  participants, their carers and providers. The Council agreed this communication would be led by  the NDIA through its website at www.ndis.gov.au and via Facebook and Twitter, and through  regular alerts, information and training resources to NDIS providers from the NDIS Quality and  Safeguards Commission through its website at www.ndiscommission.gov.au .

If NDIS participants or their carers have questions or require advice, they can also contact the  NDIS Contact Centre on 1800 800 110.

The Council acknowledged the role of states and territories to support people with disability in  their own jurisdictions, and reiterated its commitment to continue working collaboratively to  ensure appropriate safeguards and supports are in place for people with disability, their carers  and the disability sector as a whole.

The Council reiterated the importance of continual engagement with the disability sector to  monitor the response to COVID-19 and ensure the needs of people with disability, their carers  and providers are being met.

The Council will meet as required, with the next scheduled meeting on 6 April 2020, to further  discuss the national response to COVID-19.
