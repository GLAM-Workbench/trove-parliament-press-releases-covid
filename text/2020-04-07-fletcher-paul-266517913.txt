7 April 2020  Keeping our kids safe online during COVID-19

A new guide to online safety for parents and carers has specific tips and advice for this time when  children are spending more time online because of the response to COVID-19.

Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher MP, and the eSafety  Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, are encouraging parents and carers to take some simple steps to  help keep their kids safe online.

Minister Fletcher said that as Australians respond to COVID-19, we are using the internet more than  ever to work, learn, socialise and be entertained.

“The upcoming school holiday period will be very different for Australian families - and children will  be spending a lot of time online,” Minister Fletcher said.

“Parents and carers can take some simple steps to manage the risks kids can face online - including  cyberbullying and unwanted contact from strangers. This time at home is a good opportunity for  parents to start the online safety chat with their kids.

“The eSafety Commissioner is here to help keep families safe, offering practical tools that empower  parents and carers to be a positive influence in their kids’ online lives.”

Higher use of the internet during the COVID-19 crisis has been accompanied by a 40 per cent spike in  reports to eSafety across its reporting areas.

eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said there is a real need for information and advice and the  new COVID-19 Global Safety Advice for Parents and Carers, is already helping Australian families to  stay safe online.

“Our 2018 National Parents Survey found that 95 per cent of parents agreed they needed more  information about keeping their kids safe online and that’s why we’re here to help,” Ms Inman Grant  said.

“The online environment can change quickly and the three biggest concerns of parents that we see are  their child’s privacy, approaches from strangers and how to tell when their child has had a bad  experience online.”



eSafety’s top tips for parents in protecting their kids online include:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ using parental controls in apps and devices to monitor and limit what your child does online  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ setting time limits for using devices during non-school hours  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ keeping your kids in open areas of the home when using their devices   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ turning on or reviewing privacy settings to restrict who contacts your child in apps and games,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ keeping engaged through co-view and co-play by joining in with your child’s online activities.
