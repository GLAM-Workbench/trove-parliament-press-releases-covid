TRANSCRIPT

PALMERSTON PRESS CONFERENCE  11 August 2020





E&OE

Subject: Northern Territory Election;

LIA FINOCCHIARO

Today, the Country Liberal Party is announcing that if elected to Government in just two weeks’ time  we will invest $750,000 in purchasing five additional mobile CCTV vans for our hard working police.  We know crime has been a key issue over the last four years and has skyrocketed under the Gunner  Government. House break-ins across the Territory are up 52%. Territorians have had enough of  being victims of crime and that's why our policies focused on delivering consequences for offenders  and empowering our Police so they can continue to keep Territorians safe. CCTV is an important tool  for our Police and acts as a very strong deterrent for anti-social and criminal behaviour. Just recently  in Palmerston, we have had playgrounds burnt to the ground, people are suffering break-ins every  single day. Territorians have had had enough and by having five more CCTV vans at the Police's  disposal to be able to use as an all-important deterrent measure and of course, to be able to  monitor and ensure that if a criminal activity does take place, the Police are able to use that vision as  evidence. It is critically important to our response and in protecting our community and keeping  Territorians safe.

LEANNE BUTLER

There's not one street that I've walked down in my electorate that hasn't expressed to me the anti-social behaviours that have happened in their streets. It's got to stop. Enough’s enough.

JOURNALIST

Do you think - there is some sort of evidence or statistics that says in Darwin, in Palmerston, in  Central Australia that there is a perception of a crime issue rather than an actual increase in some  places, for example, in Darwin?







LEANNE BUTLER

Well, I don't know what's happening in Darwin but what I do know is in my electorate, every single  person I talked to has been touched by anti-social behaviour or crime in some way.

JOURNALIST

In what kind of instance?

LEANNE BUTLER

So break-ins, but a lot of loud music being played. We are seeing a lot of swearing, drunken  behaviour, trying to break-in, shaking fences, stirring up dogs, that sort of thing. That has just really  annoyed people.

JOURNALIST

Isn't loud music, dog issues, that sounds like more of a local council issue?

LEANNE BUTLER

Well, I don't think that it should be. I think it should be everyone's problem. I think that especially  the anti-social behaviour and the criminal behaviour that's been happening in our suburbs has got to  stop. Whether it's a council issue or it's everybody's issue, it's a community issue.

MARIE-CLARE BOOTHBY

Every day that I've been out door knocking, I hear stories of how people are sick and tired of hearing  and seeing the groups of youths that are out in the street every single night and it seeming like  nothing is being done about it.

JOURNALIST

The Chief Minister says Coronavirus is the biggest thing brought up to him would you beg to differ?

MARIE-CLARE BOOTHBY

Coronavirus has been a very important thing that people are also concerned about but they are  more concerned right now about the impact of people breaking into their homes and all of their  property being under threat by people who are doing the wrong thing.

JOURNALIST

Has it been a documented rise in break-ins?





MARIE-CLARE BOOTHBY

There's been a 50% rise in break-ins in Palmerston over the past four years.

JOURNALIST

And do you know, that this can be attributed to young people, or is it people who are not youths?

MARIE-CLARE BOOTHBY

Crime is crime, if anybody is breaking the law, they should be held to account. There should be  consequences for those people.

JOURNALIST

You've just spoken about young people - groups of young people walking around.

MARIE-CLARE BOOTHBY

Yes and this includes young people, there should be mandatory community service for those as well.

JOURNALIST

So what is the solution that you're promoting then to this? Should there be more things for young  people to do -

MARIE-CLARE BOOTHBY

If young people are out on the street and breaking the law, they should be held accountable. They  should not be breaking into people's homes. So they need to have mandatory community service to  ensure that they know right from wrong.

MATTHEW KERLE

I've been door knocking now for six months and a lot of local issues have been brought up with me,  but one of the key consistent ones that comes on the doors is youth crime and crime in general,  particularly break-ins. One of the things that people are most frustrated by is when Police come to  attend the crime scene after the break-in and they look at CCTV footage and they just shake their  heads and they say, “it's those people again.” People are frustrated by the fact that there's a small  group of people who are committing over and over again and we really want that to stop. People are  so frustrated. If you get broken-in to, that's one thing but if you get broken-in to by someone who's  out on bail from another offense, then that really makes people upset.









JOURNALIST

So you do feel like these new mobile CCTV police units would be a deterrent then, if they’re  continuing to do it?

MATTHEW KERLE

Yes, we've seen the deployment of mobile CCTV around Blain, around certain hotspots and they've  definitely had an impact. However, the problem is that there's not enough of them. They get moved  around and as soon as they go, the anti-social behaviour comes back.

JOURNALIST

What do you think about the policies from Territory Alliance on having community courts and  getting communities in Palmerston to work out what the solutions should be to some of these  problems together? And do you acknowledge that there's a broader issue that's sort of fuelling this?

MATTHEW KERLE

There definitely is, I haven't spent much time looking at their policies. However, one of the key  pillars of our policies is that they will be community centred. So, we want to get behind community  groups who are willing to come alongside this, there are youths who are involved in offending and  we want community groups to come alongside these youths and act as role models, certainly as a  way out of the cycle that they may be caught in. No one can do it by themselves. We need to come  together. We need the community involved to be part of the solution.

LIA FINOCCHIARO

At the moment, Territorians feel like CCTV isn't delivering any results, but that's because the law  doesn't support the system. Our laws around changing bail will mean that CCTV can be used and  empower police to be able to get offenders. We know that repeat offending is a huge issue in the  Northern Territory and that's why our changes to bail reform and winding back erosion of  consequences under the Gunner Government are going to keep Territorians safer. We believe that if  you are a repeat offender, you should not enjoy a presumption in favour of bail and if you are bailed  you should have to wear an electronic monitoring device and that that monitoring device should be  signalled straight to Police so that enforcement of curfew and other bail arrangements are  maintained. This is about keeping Territorians safe and that's why our investment in five new mobile  CCTV vans for the Palmerston area is going to act as a major deterrent in crime and anti-social  behaviour and keep the people of Palmerston safe.

JOURNALIST

Do we feel like those units would be a deterrent despite obviously this small group of young people  who clearly don't care?





LIA FINOCCHIARO

We know that mobile CCTV and CCTV in general is a strong deterrent against crime and anti-social  behaviour. The beauty of the mobile CCTV system is that police can use it to support their operation.  So they're mobile, they can be agile and target hotspots as required and that's an important asset to  our Police in catching criminals.

JOURNALIST



There's been some criticism of your approach to youth crime and I guess the language around it and  not just the policies. The Greens candidate, for example, for Fannie Bay, Peter Robertson saying it's  unfairly targeting and I guess stereotyping Aboriginal people. What would you say about that?

LIA FINOCCHIARO

I would say that that is absolutely not the case, our policies are about keeping all Territorians safe.  Under the Gunner Government, house break-ins have gone up 52%, Territorians are very concerned  about crime in our community and our policies range from supporting and empowering our Police to  ensuring that there is a consequence for every offense.



JOURNALIST

So that stat that you just quoted, can you express the timeframe and location surrounding that?

LIA FINOCCHIARO

I'm happy to send you the detail but that's from the 15-16 year right across the Territory, that's the  overarching Northern Territory -

JOURNALIST



We've seen the Health Minister today have to come out and clarify some comments from the Chief  Minister that said our hard borders may remain in place for 18 months. Were you confused by some  of these comments? Did that make it seem like things have changed?

LIA FINOCCHIARO

I think the Chief Minister today has proven that he is using COVID-19 as an election tool to scare  Territorians during a global pandemic. He cannot be so careless and reckless with his language and  the fact that the Health Minister has had to come out today and clean up his mess just shows how  low he's willing to go. To use a global pandemic to scare Territorians this many days out from an  election.





JOURNALIST

Territory Alliance is asking for the borders to be closed with New South Wales. What's your position  on that?



LIA FINOCCHIARO

We support the best health advice and we know that the best health advice is hotspot management,  is having Police on our borders, is capturing all of the information of people entering the Territory.  About where they've come from, how long they're staying, where they intend to go and when they  intend to leave and we will continue to follow the expert health advice.



JOURNALIST

Territory Alliance is also accused the Chief Minister of some hypocrisy in telling Territorians that they  should cancel their Christmas plans and then sort of giving the perception that the borders are  closed when in fact we've got them open to many people.

LIA FINOCCHIARO

The Chief Minister has very clearly today overstepped the mark and is politicising his response to  COVID-19. People are genuinely worrying about this global pandemic and the fact that he is using  irresponsible language and sending mixed signals is reckless and a Chief Minister should know  better. This is not a tool to win an election and he is desperately trying to save his job by scaring  Territorians. If he has a new announcement around COVID-measures, he should do that properly,  ensure that it’s updated on the SAFE NT website and ensure that Territorians clearly understand  what the new rules are. But instead, what we've seen is the Health Minister have to come out and  correct his reckless, irresponsible mistakes because all he is doing is scare-mongering to save his job.

JOURNALIST



Do you think it could be damaging to tourism?

LIA FINOCCHIARO

We know that COVID-19 has disrupted every industry and has caused huge financial and economic  impact right across our nation and right across our world. But it's important that we continue to  listen to the health expert advice and hotspot management is clearly an important way in which we  can keep Territorians safe but still maintain open borders with COVID-free jurisdictions.













JOURNALIST

What do you think about Territory Alliance’s community courts idea? Do you think that that could be  something that could work in addition to what you're proposing?

LIA FINOCCHIARO

We think the proposal to add an additional layer of bureaucracy around sentencing is not going to  deliver the outcomes that it's being touted to deliver. We believe there should be a consequence for  every offense, there needs to be continuous Police recruitment. We need to ensure that people who  are on bail are complying with their bail conditions and that repeat offenders do not enjoy  presumptions in favour of bail.



JOURNALIST

What does the Country Liberals want to try to do to ensure that those people don't commit the  crimes?

LIA FINOCCHIARO

It's important that you have a suite of measures when addressing crime and that's why we're so  focused on supporting programs like the Australian Nurse-Family Partnerships, which supports  parents right from conception through to school age. We need our kids in school and we want all of  our children to have the best start in life but for those who are engaging in the criminal justice  system, there must be a consequence for every offense.



MICHAEL McCORMACK



I can just say a few words in support of the initiative announced today, three quarters of a million  dollars to have five mobile vans to help Police, to resource Police to do their job. To give them the  resources and the necessary technology to help them to stamp out anti-social behaviour. This is both  a reactive and a proactive measure and I say reactive because if people know that they're going to  do the wrong thing, well, they're going to be caught and if they're going to be caught, as Lia  Finocchiaro has just said, they are going to face consequences for those misdeeds and those actions.  And of course it's proactive, because if people do know that there are cameras and that they are  mobile, then there is a deterrent factor there to stop them from doing the wrong thing in the first  place. I know how valuable closed circuit television is, how good it is when it has been put in place.  Whether it's in a fixed situation or whether it's in a mobile van situation as is being announced  today. A CLP Government will make sure that anti-social behaviour is very much stamped out in the  Northern Territory. We need a Government with a vision, making sure that safety, jobs and  opportunity is at the forefront and certainly today, this is all about safety. It's about having people to  be safe in their own homes.





JOURNALIST

How do you think Michael Gunner’s handling the coronavirus crisis? And do you think he's  politicising the issue?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, I know there's been mixed messages coming out of the Gunner Government today. Look, as I  said yesterday, I'm not, as part of the national government, here to criticise any Chief Minister or  any Premier. I appreciate that at a local level there are issues and there are concerns and many  people are worried. There's an increased anxiety, obviously with COVID-19. I appreciate that this has  had very worrying and disturbing consequences for so many people who, dare I say, in the Eastern  States locked down at the moment in their own homes and can't go out at night. That has great  consequences. We don't want to see that in the Northern Territory. I support Lia and her initiatives  to do what she can and say what she said so far during the COVID-19 situation. We will get through  this. We will get through it together, the Northern Territory, with the ACT and the other six states  around that National Cabinet table. I look forward to the day that Lia can take part in those National  Cabinet discussions so that we can provide the economic assistance that we need, not only to  Darwin and Katherine and Tennant Creek and everywhere else in the Northern Territory, but indeed  right across the nation. I look forward to Scott Morrison having Lia around that table to talk about  the issues that matter, in the relief and recovery through COVID-19. Thank you very much.
