Resources and mining hold steady in face of global pandemic challenges

Latest national accounts figures released today have again revealed how important the  resources sector is to the Australian economy through the global coronavirus pandemic.

Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia Keith Pitt said the industry is proving  more than resilient.

“The mining industry bucked the national trend to see a 0.2 per cent increase in output  during the June quarter, which is also a 1.1 per cent rise on the same period last year,” Mr  Pitt said.

“Encouragingly, mining investment also rose by 1.3 per cent on the previous quarter, and up  by almost 8 per cent on the previous year, which is a good indication of the confidence in  the Australian resources sector, despite the impact of COVID-19.

“It continues to directly employ over 200 thousand Australians and supports the jobs of well  over a million others.

“While it is devastating to see the nationwide job losses caused by the impact of the  coronavirus, we will get to the other side of this crisis and resources is well-placed to help  lead our economic recovery.

“It will be all about job creation as emerge from the pandemic and mining will be in a good  position to do just that, particularly for regional Australia,” Mr Pitt said.

“The extra measures the resources industry have taken to keep workers and communities  safe and healthy is paying dividends for Australia now, and will pay even greater dividends  when we reach the other side of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
