2020 organ donation outcomes released

Data released today reveals the true impact the Coronavirus pandemic had on life-saving organ  donation and transplantation rates in 2020, prompting calls for more people to register as a donor.

National organ donation and transplant data for 2020, released by federal Minister responsible for  the Organ and Tissue Authority, Mark Coulton, shows while Australia’s donation rate has doubled  over the past decade, the national program took a hit in 2020 due to COVID-19.

“Australians from all walks of life faced great challenges and adversity in 2020 and those waiting for  life-changing organ transplants were no different,” Minister Coulton said.

“Last year saw a 12 per cent reduction in the number of people receiving a transplant and a 16 per  cent decrease in organ donors, compared to 2019.

“Most significantly, 18 per cent fewer kidney transplants were performed, resulting in 153 fewer  renal patients receiving the kidney transplant they need.”

Minister Coulton said the 2020 data exceeds earlier predictions, which serves as a testament to the  highly-skilled DonateLife teams, as well as dedicated donation and transplantation staff across the  country.

Organ and Tissue Authority CEO, Lucinda Barry, said at the start of the pandemic, the transplant  sector took precautionary steps and suspended kidney transplant programs from late-March  through to mid-May.

This was due to the concern about hospitals being overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients and also to  prevent transplant patients at high risk being exposed to the virus. Urgent heart, lung, liver and  paediatric transplants continued during this time for critically ill patients.

“It’s not surprising to see that the 2020 outcomes have been impacted, but minimising the risks to  transplant and waiting list patients has been the priority for everyone involved,” Ms Barry said.

“To minimise the impacts, our DonateLife teams worked hard with transplant teams to navigate the  challenges facing hospitals and with logistics — including with COVID-19 restrictions, flight  reductions and border closures — so that patients received the best possible outcomes.”

Minister Coulton said despite the obvious impacts, 1,270 Australian lives were saved in 2020 through  an organ transplant thanks to the generosity of 463 deceased organ donors and their families.

“Families have continued to show their strength and generosity in agreeing to donation, even with  the added COVID-19 complexities in intensive care units,” Minister Coulton said.

“Around 1,650 Australians are waitlisted for a transplant and more than 12,000 others are on  dialysis — many of whom may need a kidney transplant.

“The best chance we have to address the challenge of a longer waitlist is to have more Australians  say ‘yes’ to donation.”

Minister Coulton said data shows that registering to become a donor and talking to your family  about your decision has a direct influence on consent rates, so encouraged people to have the chat  and register today.

Living organ donation and eye and tissue donation outcomes will soon be released in the Organ and  Tissue Authority’s 2020 Activity Report.

Transplantation is an  effective and well-established  treatment that saves lives,  restores health and improves  quality of life.

Receiving an organ  transplant is not possible  without organ donation.
