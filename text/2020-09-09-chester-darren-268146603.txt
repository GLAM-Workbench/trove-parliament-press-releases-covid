AUSTRALIANS RECOGNISE OUR FALLEN ON REMEMBRANCE DAY 2020

IN the lead-up to Remembrance Day 2020, schools and community groups across the country are  being provided with free resources to assist them in teaching our next generation about the  importance of the day, as well as promoting its observance on 11 November.

Minister for Veterans’ Affairs Darren Chester said Remembrance Day was one of the most significant  days on our national calendar and the mail-out was just one way the Federal Government created an  understanding and awareness in the community of the importance of commemorating all those who  have died in service to the nation.

“More than 102,000 of those who have served our nation in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping  operations have made the ultimate sacrifice and at the 11th hour, of the 11th day, of the 11th month,  the nation pauses for a minute of solemn and silent reflection to remember them,” Mr Chester said.

“To assist schools and community groups commemorate Remembrance Day in a dignified and  respectful manner, the mail-out includes posters, educational activities and other resources that tell  the story of our wartime history.

“I encourage all those in the community who are looking to learn more about those who have served  our nation and the importance of Remembrance Day to access the resources online.”

The mail-out includes material that looks back at the Second World War, which ended 75 years ago  this year, and recognises the important roles families and communities played in supporting the war  effort on the home front.

The mail-out is distributed to more than 17,000 recipients across Australia and overseas and this  year’s Remembrance Day posters feature Australians celebrating the declaration of peace at the end  of the Second World War on 15 August 1945, as well as Royal Australian Air Force personnel  receiving official news of Japan’s surrender on the same day.

Due to coronavirus, this year aged care facilities will only receive a letter from the Minister for  Veterans’ Affairs and Victorian schools will receive a digital version of the mail-out. Mail-out  resources are available for free download on the Anzac Portal or by emailing education@dva.gov.au.
