LABOR WELCOMES ONLINE CITIZENSHIP CEREMONIES

Labor welcomes the decision by the Government to enable online, secure citizenship  ceremonies during the COVID-19 crisis.

We have been calling on the Morrison Government to outline a plan that would ensure  permanent residents about to become citizens would still have the opportunity to pledge  allegiance to Australia during this crisis.

A citizenship ceremony is one of the most important ceremonies members of our  community take and it comes after years of living in, and contributing to, Australia, along  with completing the required citizenship test.

Labor wrote to the Acting Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and  Multicultural Affairs, Alan Tudge, proposing the adoption of online citizenship ceremonies,  on behalf of thousands of people who want to complete their journey to Australian  citizenship.

The cancellation of traditional citizenship ceremonies has caused anxiety for many people  and we are pleased that a solution has been found that meets social distancing  requirements and allows people to pledge allegiance to Australia.

Labor is committed to working constructively with the Government to do everything we can  to support and protect Australians during this crisis, including our newest Australians.
