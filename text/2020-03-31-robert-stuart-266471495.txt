$1.1 BILLION IN ECONOMIC SUPPORT PAYMENTS TO HIT  BANK ACCOUNTS TODAY

Over $1.1 billion in Australian Government assistance for lower income Australians will hit bank  accounts today.

Minister for Government Services, Stuart Robert, said the first round of the $750 Economic Support  Payments will be paid automatically from today and progressively to eligible recipients over the  coming weeks.

‘From today, more than 6.8 million Australians will receive the first Economic Support Payment,’  Minister Robert said.

‘The payment is providing immediate support to lower income Australians, including pensioners, other  social security and veteran income support recipients and eligible concession card holders.

‘There’s no need to do anything to receive the Economic Support Payment - it will be paid  automatically to anyone receiving an eligible payment or concession between 12 March 2020 and 13  April 2020.’

The total first stimulus package is expected to deliver $4.8 billion to households through the Economic  Support Payment. It is part of the Australian Government’s $320 billion economic support package for  the coronavirus pandemic.

A second Economic Support Payment will be paid to eligible people from 13 July 2020.
