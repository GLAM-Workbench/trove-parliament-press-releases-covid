QANTAS VS REX IS THE LATEST SYMPTOM OF MORRISON  GOVERNMENT’S FAILURE TO HAVE A NATIONAL AVIATION PLAN

Recent reports that Qantas and Rex will fight it out on regional routes is the latest symptom of  the Morrison Government’s failure to develop a comprehensive aviation plan as we emerge  from COVID 19.

Rather than chart a way forward for Australian aviation, the Morrison Government’s inept  market interventions have laid the groundwork for a fight between Qantas and Rex which has  the potential to see even more loss of service for regional Australians.

It is essential that Australia maintains two strong, competitive airlines and ongoing regional  services as we emerge from this crisis. An environment where two airlines are now seeking to  cannibalise each other’s market share is not in the long-term interests of the industry, aviation  workers or regional Australians.

This is a direct result of the Morrison Government’s failures and their decision to pick winners  and losers in the industry.

Instead of using the last 12 months to come up with a plan for aviation, the Morrison  Government has fed market chaos, threatening jobs and putting in danger the regional routes  that communities rely on.

Now we are left with flight cuts for consumers, a race to the bottom for workers and  unsustainable competition for airlines.

Aviation has been in a state of market failure for almost 12 months. The Deputy Prime Minister  needs to get off his hands and take action before even more damage is done to this essential  industry.
