FLETCHER AND AUS POST THROW TASMANIAN FOOD GROWERS UNDER

A BUS



The Morrison Government and Australia Post have ended the delivery of

perishable goods without adequate consultation, abandoning our world-class

producers and growers.



Australian producers deserve certainty, not cheap shot cuts to services, without

adequate consultation, that undermine jobs in the regions.



It is particularly disappointing this occurred after so much disruption to supply

chains because of COVID-19 restrictions and the pain exporters, including small

and independent growers, have already suffered from trade tariffs.



The Morrison Government must immediately work with Australia Post and

producers to find a long-term solution so products can make it to market.





It cannot allow an out of touch Communications Minister, without the faintest

understanding of why people in the regions rely on Australia Post, to keep cutting

services at will.
