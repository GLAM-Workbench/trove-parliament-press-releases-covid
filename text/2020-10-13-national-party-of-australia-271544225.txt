NEIL BREEN

Good morning to you, Deputy Prime Minister.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Good morning, Neil.

NEIL BREEN

Are you coming up to have a holiday as you've all been accused of by our Deputy Premier Steven  Miles?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

No, no, I'm coming to sell the jobs budget. I'm coming to ensure that Queenslanders know about the  benefits of the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, the Road Safety Program, the  new projects and additional funding. There's so much money that we're pumping into the sunshine  state and it's very much a jobs and regions budget and I'm coming to spruik the merits of that so that  those councils who aren't aware of all the benefits, then they certainly will be after I've been there.  And also, good to catch up with some of my Queensland colleagues. So we're travelling the Bruce,  going up to Bundaberg and Rockhampton, Yeppoon, up to Mackay, so it'll be good.







NEIL BREEN

Are you driving?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Driving the Bruce, spending a lot of time on the road. I am flying up to Brisbane of course from  Canberra.

NEIL BREEN

Well you're not allowed to drive through New South Wales, so you have to fly.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well indeed, that is correct and so I've spent my two weeks in Canberra to ensure that I can get  there. I come from regional New South Wales and there's not been a COVID case in my hometown  for some time and indeed, around my region there's many, many parts that have not had a COVID  case at all. But look, rules are made by Queensland, I understand that. So I've met those  requirements and very much looking forward to getting up there today.

NEIL BREEN

You'll be driving the Bruce Highway. Deb Frecklington, one of her election promises is that by 2032  she wants to spend $33 billion to make it a four-lane highway from Gympie to Cairns, by 2032 as I  said. Will the Federal Government help with that because she won't be able to pay for it herself?  Maybe your drive will convince you to hand over $33 billion.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well we certainly will be helping her with that vision and I talk to George Christensen and Michelle  Landry and Ken O'Dowd and others all the time about the importance of the Bruce and not just for,  of course that freight path, that tourist destination that it is, but indeed for the road safety. We want  to make sure that whether it's the Bruce Highway or any other road in Queensland that it gets the  attention that it needs. So that's why we are investing considerably in Queensland and since coming  to Government we've spent $28.5 billion in Queensland. I appreciate that Deb has a grand vision not  just for road infrastructure but for water infrastructure and of course, in the budget there was $2  billion on top of the $1.5 billion we already had and we're already spending on water infrastructure.  So, it will be good to go up to those parts of North Queensland, Central Queensland and talk water  infrastructure because it's a big topic and there is lots of potential there, unlocking agriculture,  unlocking the huge additional potential of mining and resources of course.







NEIL BREEN

While you're here will you also check out the tourism industry in towns like that, because tourism is  a massive problem for Queensland at the moment, and we know why -

MICHAEL McCORMACK

It's been so hard hit. Aviation of course was hit first and hit hard and of course hot on the heels of  that was tourism. So, you've got places like Cairns and the tropical North where they haven't had a  COVID case for some time, in many cases if at all and of course they've been hamstrung by these  border closures. Planes in the sky means jobs on the ground, certainly in the tourism sector. I've  been talking to a number of people right across the tourism industry and they are just fraught with  despair about what has gone on.

NEIL BREEN

I'm talking to the Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack. Obviously, you will be here to help  Deb Frecklington as well and that's part of a democracy. I don't know why the Labor Party and  Steven Miles just goes on and on and on about, â€œThose guys are coming up to help Deb  Frecklington", that's what a democracy is all about, right? You're allowed to help people.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, Deb and I share some connections, she spent some time in the Riverina in my electorate doing  law and practicing law and of course she's a Queensland girl. She's a regional girl. She's a Kingaroy  advocate and she's passionate about making sure Queensland can be its best self. It hasn't been that  way for some time and she wants a better Queensland for all Queenslanders. I get that. I'm certainly  glad to help out. She's been a good mate of mine for a long time and I share her vision for a better  Queensland. When Queensland's strong so too is our nation and whilst I am from New South Wales I  fully understand how important it is for Queensland to be ticking along as best it can and at the  moment it's not.

NEIL BREEN

We like the people of New South Wales, don't worry.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

You like to beat us in the State of Origin, Neil, I appreciate that.

NEIL BREEN

We do. We don't want to talk Origin this year. Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack, enjoy  your trip to Queensland and thanks for joining us on 4BC Breakfast.





MICHAEL McCORMACK

A pleasure.
