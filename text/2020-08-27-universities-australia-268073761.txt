STATEMENT FROM UNIVERSITIES AUSTRALIA ON PROPOSED FOREIGN RELATIONS LEGISLATION

Universities Australia Chief Executive Catriona Jackson said:

“We are in early discussions with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Education, Skills and Employment

on the implications for universities of the Government’s proposed foreign relations legislation.”

“It will be very important to discuss the exact definitions and scale of what the new laws are intended to capture.”

“Universities are equal partners with Government agencies in the Universities Foreign Interference Taskforce (UFIT), which has devised

robust guidelines that build on measures to keep our institutions and intellectual property secure.”

“It is critically important to strike the right balance between national security and the research collaboration which is driving so many

advances in knowledge - including the search for a COVID-19 vaccine.”
