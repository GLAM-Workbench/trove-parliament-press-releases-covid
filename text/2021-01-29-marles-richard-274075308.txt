Interview with Allison Langdon and the Hon Richard Marles MP, Today Show, Channel Nine minister.homeaffairs.gov.au/peterdutton/Pages/today-show-channel-nine-20210129.aspx

Subjects: QLD border and call to extend JobKeeper; Labor Party reshuffle; COVID-19 vaccine rollout; Mulletfest.

EO&E.......

ALLISON LANGDON:

Within hours of making that border announcement, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk wasted no time calling on the Prime Minister to extend support for the state's struggling tourism sector. We're joined now by Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton in Canberra and Deputy Opposition Leader Richard Marles from Adelaide. Nice to talk to you both.

PETER DUTTON:

Morning Ally.

RICHARD MARLES:

Good to talk to you Ally.

ALLISON LANGDON:

So Peter, are you going to bail her out?

PETER DUTTON:

Well obviously we don't take economic advice from the Queensland Premier. I think the Prime Minister's demonstrated Ally, right through this, that we've been able to make the right decisions both in terms of JobSeeker, JobKeeper, but many other payments beyond that to support those on fixed incomes, people who are on pensions. We've provided significant assistance to businesses and JobKeeper is coming to an end, but the Government's been very clear that if we need to provide further assistance, we'll look at that.

Everybody feels for people, particularly in the tourism, aviation sectors, but other sectors as well and it is made harder, as we just saw in that interview, where these snap decisions are made to close borders, bookings are cancelled, restaurants have ordered food, they've employed staff, they've got bookings, but they need to close that night with no warning at all. So we just need to get that balance right.

As was pointed out there, there needs to be consistency by the Premiers around what the definition of the hotspot is so that there is an ability to plan, particularly for businesses, because otherwise people are out of jobs.

ALLISON LANGDON:

What did you think when you heard her request yesterday?

PETER DUTTON:

Well I thought there was some politics in it; and she's in politics, as Richard and I are, so you expect a level of that, but I thought the gentleman in the previous interview summed it up well; that yes, the health aspects have been managed well, we took the right decision as a country to close the border first with China and then the rest of the world 12 months ago and that put us in a very strong position. We obviously had managed the budget well in the lead-up to COVID so we've got capacity to provide support, not just to businesses, but to the Australian community as well to see us through this, but we are getting lots of stories now from businesses who can't find staff because they're at home on JobKeeper.

So we've got the balance right so far as a Federal Government and we'll continue to do that, to listen to the concerns, but to get the balance right and that's exactly what we're seeking to do in this budget that's coming up in May.

ALLISON LANGDON:

Well I hope what we're hearing from that is there will be support for the tourism industry, not just tourism, aviation, they've got months and months of pain ahead of them. Richard, is it fair for Anna to ask for help? The argument has been she shut the borders, why should the Federal Government have to bail her out?

RICHARD MARLES:

Well I think it's absolutely reasonable for Annastacia Palaszczuk to be making that point. I mean if you think about certain sectors, and you just mentioned them - tourism, aviation - I mean they're not back to normal and the Government's got to be really careful about the way in which it transitions out of JobKeeper. If it does it at a rate which doesn't match up with what's actually going on out there, well then we're going to see massive job losses.

I mean until we've got the international border open, a place like Queensland, which is heavily reliant on tourism, is going to do it tough.

So I completely understand why Annastacia Palaszczuk would be making that point, given how important tourism is for her state. But I'd make the other point in relation to borders.

I mean it's fine for Peter to make those points about states and the way in which they're acting. The problem here is the Federal Government has completely abrogated its responsibility here. I mean it has vacated the field. I don't understand why Scott Morrison and the Federal Government aren't in these decisions and they've left all of this up to the states.

ALLISON LANGDON:

I think the issue here is, I think they've tried to be part of it, but it's a state issue, they control the borders and they're doing what they want when it comes to borders.

RICHARD MARLES:

Well can I just say Ally, I mean there's an assumption about all of that. The Federal Government from day one took itself out of the whole question of our internal borders. I don't think we can say right now that the question of our nation's internal borders are solely a state issue. I mean that's a big call to make about where Australia's at. The issue here is that from day one, Scott Morrison took himself out of the field. So we've really got, in terms of our federation now, one of the weakest national governments we have seen and that's why we've got the chaos that's played out over the last year.

ALLISON LANGDON:

Well look I think it's hard to put this one on Scott Morrison. I think he's been trying to speak to Mark McGowan and Annastacia Palaszczuk. The states make the decisions about border, that's just the way it is. But Richard, we need to talk about what's happening within your Party. Is everyone okay?

RICHARD MARLES:

Everyone's really good.

ALLISON LANGDON:

Congratulations on your promotion yesterday by the way. You're basically in charge of everything now. But I mean the question is, Albo, he can shuffle the ranks all he wants, but he's not taking you to the next election, is he?

RICHARD MARLES:

Anthony is absolutely taking us to the next election and what we saw yesterday with the reshuffle is seeking to put a focus on jobs as being the key issue that we will be contesting every day between now and when the Australians go to the next election because the situation we've got at the moment is that, when you consider both unemployment and under-employment, there's more than two million Australians right now who are looking for work. What COVID-19 has done, is really exposed problems within our economy. We don't make things in this country in anything like the way we used to back in 2013.

ALLISON LANGDON:

I mean you need the shift because, as you say, you're not cutting through. Albo reckons he'll be our next prime minister after the next election. Peter, the sharks are circling though aren't they?

PETER DUTTON:

The Hon Peter Dutton MP  Minister for Home Affairs

4/6

Well they are and what he did yesterday was apply a band-aid to a shark bite Ally. It's quite unbelievable to watch the Labor Party going into what they went through in the Rudd- Gillard years. Clearly there's now going to be a challenge by Tanya Plibersek and Jim Chalmers. That's just a matter of time. Richard at the moment is playing the loyal Deputy role as Julia Gillard did - and good on him - I mean he's the only winner out of yesterday and as all of the commentators said after the presentation, Richard completely outshone Albo. It's game on in there.

The problem though is that they can shuffle the personnel all they like. It can be Albo, it can be Tanya Plibersek, could be Richard; the fact is that their policies are designed to destroy jobs, to jack up taxes, to increase electricity prices and, frankly, that's the real problem within the Labor Party and they're not yet prepared to address it.

ALLISON LANGDON:

And the disarray, of course, that's something the Coalition has never seen, of course. But I want to move on because…

PETER DUTTON:

….we learnt our lesson and I promise you we have moved on.

ALLISON LANGDON:

Well everyone thinks they've learnt their lesson until it happens the next time around.

But I do want to talk about this though, because there are real worries about our vaccine rollout. Germany is now warning against giving it to the over 65s. This is the one we've ordered 50 million doses of; AstraZeneca. Doesn't do much for public confidence Peter.

PETER DUTTON:

Well Ally, I really think people need to look at the advice that's coming out of the TGA.

Now, Australia has one of the most superior health systems in the world and frankly this has been a very strong bipartisan position; the Labor Party I think's been responsible on this as well. We do need to get herd immunity. Australians are great vaccinators and the medical advice, the scientific advice, in this country is what we should heed.

Now, we'll look at what is happening in the rest of the world. The Government's made a very prudent decision to invest in a number of vaccines for this very reason; that if there are problems, then we'll be able to address them, but I think people need to calmly look at the advice that's coming out of the Australian authorities. We have the best scientists in the world. They have not rushed this process. They've looked at the efficacy and the effectiveness of the vaccines and we will make the decisions to roll it out on that basis to protect Australians and that will be the first priority.

ALLISON LANGDON:

The Hon Peter Dutton MP  Minister for Home Affairs

5/6

But Richard, I mean this is all happening and we just don't like it when questions are being raised. They may not be being asked by the TGA here in Australia right now, but we've got German scientists and doctors raising concerns about the effectiveness of AstraZeneca in those over 65. All of this as Pfizer basically can't keep up with global demand. It doesn't put us in a great position, does it?

RICHARD MARLES:

Well there are a couple of points here Ally. First of all, we do make criticism of the Government in terms of its slowness out of the blocks in putting Australia in the queue in relation to a number of these vaccines. It matters that we are right up there, in terms of all the vaccines that are going to have an effect here, in the queue, to make sure that we have availability here in Australia. We're concerned about how the Government has handled that over the course of the last few months.

But the second point where I do very much agree with what Peter says, that the TGA, and our authorities are as good as any in the world and the advice that they give us in relation to the safety of vaccines is really important for people to listen to and adhere. And when the vaccines come online, they will only come online if they are safe to use and, at that moment, it's really important that people take up the opportunity of that vaccination. And so listening to the medical advice, the expert advice, and we've got great experts in this country, is really important for Australians to do.

ALLISON LANGDON:

Which is why we need public confidence in the vaccination rollout.

But look, you know I always like to end on a bit of a, you know, an upbeat moment to finish on a Friday. We're celebrating all things mullet because the Mulletfest is about to kick off. And you know where I'm going with this.

RICHARD MARLES:

Poor old Pete.

ALLISON LANGDON:

Poor old Pete.

PETER DUTTON:

Where are you going to…

RICHARD MARLES:

I want to see the photo of Peter in his ute.

PETER DUTTON:

I'd love a mullet. I'd be happy with that.

ALLISON LANGDON:

If you rocked that mullet, Pete, you would be prime minister of Australia.

RICHARD MARLES:

That is the Rocky Horror Picture Show right there.

ALLISON LANGDON:

Don't you laugh, Richard. Don't you laugh because this is you, my friend. That's a bit of like '80s rock-and-roll thing you've got happening there.

Well gentlemen, always good to talk to you. And I mean, as we say, it was a bit of a back-handed compliment that Peter Dutton paid you, Richard. You've been outshining Albo.

RICHARD MARLES:

I'm used to that.

ALLISON LANGDON:

Alright guys, enjoy your weekend.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks Ally.
