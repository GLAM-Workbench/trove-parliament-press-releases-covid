Saluting Australia’s primary principals

Minister for Education Dan Tehan has paid tribute to Australia’s school leaders on Australian  Primary Principals Day.

“COVID-19 has made us appreciate more than ever the important contribution that our  principals, teachers and schools make to the lives of our students,” Mr Tehan said.

“On Australian Primary Principals Day, we honour our principals for the leadership they  provide through their actions, decisions and values.

“We should all reflect on the influence that our school principals had on our lives and  education.

“I encourage students, teachers, parents and educators to take five minutes today to say  thanks to their principal.”
