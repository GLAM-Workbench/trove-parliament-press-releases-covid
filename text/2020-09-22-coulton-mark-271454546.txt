Outreach fund extension brings GPs and health services to  communities

Rural and remote patients will have access to a wider range of health services in their community  following an announcement today by the Federal Government.

Regional Heath Minister, Mark Coulton said regional, rural, and remote communities throughout  Australia will benefit from the $115 million extension to the Rural Health Outreach Fund (RHOF).

“This fund brings doctors and health professionals to patients, rather than the other way around,  allowing many thousands of people to receive their health care closer to home,” Minister Coulton said.

“The Government’s decision to continue the outreach fund is good news for patients, families,  businesses, and doctors in many areas which aren’t big enough to have a full complement of health  services.”

Minister Coulton said the fund supports medical specialists, GPs, and allied and other health providers  to visit rural, regional and remote areas, by subsidising the costs of travel, facility hire, and equipment  leasing.

Joining Minister Coulton for the announcement in Port Macquarie, Federal Member for Cowper, Pat  Conaghan said the fund was providing vital services to patients in his community.

“I’m pleased to be a member of a Government that works hard to improve health outcomes for regional  Australians,” Mr Conaghan said.

“I know here in Port Macquarie this program has provided training to some local GPs from specialist  spinal physicians so they can better care for residents with spinal cord injuries.

“Additionally, it has provided outreach maintenance consultations to these patients, helping them once  they have been discharged from a metro spinal unit."

The program predominantly focusses on mental health, eye health, chronic disease management, and  maternity and paediatric health. More than 200,000 patients nationwide receive services each year  under the RHOF.

Across the country, the program is helping improve the health of rural and remote communities, helping  provide: podiatry care in Broken Hill NSW; specialist cardiology visits to Kimba, Cleve, and Wudinna  communities in South Australia; accessible, bulk-billed gynaecological services in Wonthaggi Victoria;  comprehensive health services to the Martu people in their remote Little Sandy and Gibson Deserts  communities; maternity and midwifery services in Palm Island in Queensland; specialist ophthalmology  to remote Northern Territory communities; and multi-disciplinary chronic pain management services in  Tasmania’s North-West.

Chief Executive Officer of the NSW fundholder, the NSW Rural Doctors Network (RDN), Richard Colbran,  said RHOF services were delivered by health practitioners with strong commitments to improving health  outcomes for rural patients.

“The services funded by the RHOF are reflective of community prioritised health needs,” Mr Colbran  said.

“For many communities, the RHOF services are also an opportunity to diversify and improve the skillsets  among local health professionals including GPs, practice nurses and Aboriginal Health Workers.

“The transfer of specialised skills through outreach services remains a particularly valuable aspect of this  program because it equips the local health workforce with skills needed to manage ongoing patient care  from local primary care, community health and hospital settings.”

Minister Coulton said the Federal Government is committed to improving health services for people  living, working, and travelling in rural and remote Australia.

“The Government has taken action to support regional, rural, and remote Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Minister Coulton said.

“These include opening more than 80 new GP-led respiratory health clinics in rural and regional areas, a  further $22.8 million for staffed mobile respiratory clinics and remote health service support and  $30.0 million for aeromedical support to allow speedy evacuation of people suspected to have COVID-19.”
