Government inkjets funds to support  Coffs co-op’s berry good traceability

Ã¯ÂÂ· The Oz Group Co-op is enhancing supply chain traceability back to farm on  their berry products.  Ã¯ÂÂ· The Australian Government is supporting this project and helping the local  farming community thrive.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Enhanced supply chain traceability supports Australia’s status as one of the

world’s most trusted sources of clean, green and safe produce.

Coffs Coast farmers’ co-op Oz Group has been awarded a grant to assure customer  confidence in its premium berry supply chain through thermal labelling technology.

Minister for Agriculture David Littleproud said the Australian Government was backing the  innovative project with $316,491 in Traceability Grants Program funding.

“This is a great example of a smart-thinking, farmer-owned co-operative ensuring safe,  premium produce for Australians and the world to enjoy,” Minister Littleproud said.

“By installing inkjet printers and direct thermal labellers, they are enhancing traceability of  their berries back to individual punnets and trays.

“This will streamline processes across the packing facility and allow the co-operative to  trace all products back to the farm level.

“Aussies love their homegrown berries and the world does too, increasingly so.

“Farmers on the beautiful Coffs Coast of New South Wales produce some of the best  blueberries, blackberries and raspberries in the world.

“Enhancing and promoting integrity of its supply chains will allow Oz Group to drive more  export opportunities for its farmers.

“We are investing in projects like this because customers here and abroad want to know  more about the origin of our fantastic produce.

“It is important as we recover from COVID-19 that we take all opportunities to reinforce  Australia’s reputation as a producer of clean, green and safe food.”
