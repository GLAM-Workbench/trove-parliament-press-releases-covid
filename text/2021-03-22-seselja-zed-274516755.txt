AUSTRALIA-PAKISTAN WATER SECURITY INITIATIVE

Today on World Water Day, Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Zed Seselja,  launched the Australia-Pakistan Water Security Initiative.

Minister Seselja said water security is a challenge shared by Australia and Pakistan.

“The onset of COVID-19 has reminded the world that clean water is vital to health and reducing  the spread of disease,” Minister Seselja said.

“Over the next four years, the Australian Government will invest up to $10 million to share our  expertise in building water-sensitive cities with Pakistan.”

“Similarities between the Murray Darling Basin and Indus Valley have long provided a  foundation for technical cooperation on water security between our two nations.”

“Australian and Pakistani experts from the public and private sectors will work together using  the latest tools, techniques and technologies of urban water management,”   Minister Seselja said.

The Initiative is another example of Australia delivering on our commitment to support the  Indo-Pacific region recover from COVID-19.
