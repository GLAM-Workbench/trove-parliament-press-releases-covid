CORONAVIRUS INFORMATION MUST BE AVAILABLE IN MORE  LANGUAGES FOR OUR MULTICULTURAL COMMUNITIES

The Morrison Government must make information about COVID-19 available in more  languages so that multicultural communities across Australia have access to the latest  information on the virus.

Currently, information on health.gov.au on the coronavirus is only available in Chinese,  Farsi, Italian and Korean.

The translation of this vital public health information to other languages needs to be  extended, immediately.

Labor has written to the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt expressing our deep concern that  information about the virus is not being made readily available for Australia’s multicultural  communities, particularly older people from migrant communities, who are most at risk.

According to the 2016 census: 37 percent of Australians over 65 years old were born  overseas, and 6 percent either spoke English poorly or did not speak English at all.

This is urgent. We need important public health information getting to multicultural  communities, in their relevant language.

In addition to important health information, the campaign should include assurances to  people that Australia’s supply of food, groceries and other essentials is secure.

Labor will continue to provide bipartisan support for the handling of COVID-19 wherever  possible. We stand ready to assist in making sure our multicultural communities have  access to the latest information on COVID-19.
