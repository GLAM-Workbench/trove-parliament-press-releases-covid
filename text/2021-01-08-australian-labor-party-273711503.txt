MORRISON GOVERNMENT IGNORES TRAVEL AGENTS’ WARNINGS





The Morrison Government continues to ignore the pleas of thousands of travel agents who

are on the brink of collapse.



Further reports yesterday, demonstrate the impact this wilful ignorance is having, with

agents confirming that their businesses will not survive without immediate action.



Agents have been begging for support for months due to the disproportionate impact the

COVID-19 pandemic has had on their business and the obvious reality that there will be

no snap-back for the industry.



After months of sitting on their hands, the Government finally announced a tailored grants

program for travel agents late last year.



But true to form, this program is yet another example of the Morrison Government failing to

deliver.



Despite repeated warnings, the Government launched a program which will see agencies

close and jobs lost.





Faced with this reality, the newly appointed Minister continues to defend the program,

which is expected to see many mid-sized agencies collapse.



Only the Morrison Government could launch a tailored support package that is so poorly

targeted that the people it’s aimed at say it won’t work.



Labor has repeatedly called on the Government to address this issue, highlighting the

concerns raised by the sector, members of the peak body and the Australian Small

Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman.



The Government must fix this bungled program before more agents are forced to close

and more Australians lose their jobs.
