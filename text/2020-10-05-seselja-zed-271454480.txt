E&OE

Subjects: Budget;

WITH: SENATOR THE HON. ZED SESELJA, ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FINANCE, CHARITIES &  ELECTORAL MATTERS, SENATOR FOR THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY & ALISTAIR COE MLA,  LEADER OF THE CANBERRA LIBERALS.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Thank you very much for joining us and it's really great to be here with Zed Seselja, the ACT Liberal  Senator, and Alistair Coe, the ACT Liberal leader who on October 17 is going to become the Chief  Minister and we need a Chief Minister who understands the importance of infrastructure,  understands the importance of roads and making sure of course, that we back everything that we do  with jobs. Because that's what today's announcement is about.

Of course, tomorrow we have the Federal budget and when Josh Frydenberg goes to that dispatch  box at 7.30 tomorrow night, he's going to be talking about the jobs and infrastructure budget,  making sure, of course, that we back everything we do with that jobs component. Jobs, jobs and  more jobs.

Today is a $7.5 billion commitment. A $7.5 billion tick of approval to our economy, to those workers  in our economy to make sure that we put the right infrastructure in the right places, to build on the  connectivity, to build on the strengths of our nation.

It's been very difficult through COVID-19. It has been extraordinarily difficult. But we have made sure  that everything we've done with the $314 billion of assistance thus far to get the right health  outcomes, to make sure that we backed our economy and tomorrow night, we're going to be  producing a budget which is big on jobs, big on infrastructure and backing those things which we  know are going to help through the COVID recovery.





We've had droughts, we've had bushfires, we've had flooding in some parts of the nation, but we  want to make sure that this infrastructure package that we're announcing today - making sure that  those 82 new projects, 33 existing projects, have the support, have the money, have the backing of  the Federal Government. We've done it with the support of State and Territory Governments. Yes,  they've come in and they've identified their priority projects and we've said yes. We have said  $7.5 billion worth of yes. We are making sure that if it's a project in far flung remote Western  Australia or right here in Canberra, that we're backing it all the way.

I'll get Zed to detail some of the projects that we're supporting through the $155 million that we're  putting down to help Canberra, to support the ACT, such as the Molonglo River bridge upgrade and  the South West corridor upgrade and others, but to ensure that we get those jobs on the ground,  that's why tomorrow's budget is so important. That's why when Josh Frydenberg takes the stand for  that all-important budget announcement that he's backing jobs all the way, making sure that we  support our economy. That's what we've done all the way through. So I'll ask Zed to add to those  remarks, then I'll ask Alistair to also add to that and happy to take any questions after that.

ZED SESELJA

Thank you, Deputy Prime Minister. It's great to be here with the Deputy Prime Minister Michael  McCormack and of course the next Chief Minister of the ACT, Alistair Coe. It is a great day for  Canberra when we're able to invest over $150 million in new infrastructure investments right here.

We've seen the growth in the Molonglo Valley in the western part of Canberra putting strain on our  transport system and so whether it's the Molonglo River bridge crossing that we're committing over  $87.5 million to, or whether it's indeed the much needed upgrades to the Tuggeranong Parkway  which we're committing $50 million to, in addition to more money for the Monaro Highway, now  $115 million and indeed some planning work for Parkes Way. These are really critical investments  because we've seen significant growth in our city but in the case of the Monaro Highway of course  we've seen a lot of growth over the border and we've been catering for that growth in traffic. But  what we've seen in the last couple of years from the Liberal-National Government is the biggest  investments in Canberra in a generation. Over $1 billion in new investments have been announced.  Massive road projects - whether that's the $155 million today, the over $100 million for the  Monaro, the $150 million for the Barton Highway, as well as William Slim Drive, Kings Highway, huge  extra investments in our national institutions such as the War Memorial and the National Gallery.  Today builds on that. I'm particularly pleased with the upgrades to the Tuggeranong Parkway  because I know that if you live in Weston Creek, if you live in Molonglo Valley, if you live in Woden  or Tuggeranong, this is an absolutely critical road and it is time that it was upgraded. It will be a very,  very important first step I think in what will be the significant upgrades that are needed, including  the widening of that road as we go north of Cotter Road here.

ALISTAIR COE



Thank you very much Deputy Prime Minister and to the ACT Liberal Senator. It's wonderful to be  with you both and to join you for this very important announcement. Of course, the ACT have not  had the infrastructure investment from the ACT Government to keep pace with our growth. In this  part of the capital we have the Molonglo Valley growing very quickly, but unfortunately the growth  has surpassed the infrastructure. So it's great that the Federal Government, the Liberal-National  Coalition Government have come on board and made this substantial investment for the ACT.





I'm very pleased to say that a Canberra Liberals Government should we be elected in a couple of  weeks' time will match this investment. That is this investment will be doubled and we'll have even  more money going into infrastructure in Canberra, more jobs will be created and these projects will  actually get off the ground. The Canberra Liberals are committed to doing everything we can to  make the ACT the best place to live, work and raise a family. Everything that we do is about lowering  taxes and delivering better services for Canberrans. The upgrade to the Monaro Highway, to the  Tuggeranong Parkway and of course the Molonglo bridge are much needed infrastructure  investments in the ACT and the Canberra Liberals look forward to working with the Federal  Liberal-National Government to make these investments a reality.

JOURNALIST



Are you hoping the ACT Government will match, sorry, the Labor Government if they're elected will  match this ACT announcement?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, I'm hoping that they will because indeed we asked each State, each Territory for their priority  lists. That's what we've been provided, that's what we're supporting as well as other projects. As I  said before, 82 projects, 33 existing ones, which we're backing to the tune of $7.5 billion of new  money. We're backing to the tune of that money, but we're putting the confidence in those sectors  in getting the available workers right across the country. Because that's what it's all about, it's about  getting hi-vis workers on the ground. It's more than that though. It's also about the cafÃÂ© providing  the egg and bacon rolls nearby the work site. It's about the motel providing the accommodation for  those workers who may be finding themselves in rural and remote Australia, places they've never  been before, building a road that's going to provide such vital connectivity to get that product, that  world’s best food and fibre to port, to plate elsewhere in the world. It's about making sure that our  economy is ticking along the way it should be.

Thankfully we came into COVID with a position of economic strength. We were almost, almost there  as far as the surplus is concerned. It was just a matter of weeks away and of course then the global  pandemic hit and we've had to invest and we've been thankful that we have been able to do that.  $314 billion of money to ensure that we got the right health outcomes, to make sure that we  cushioned the effects of the economy. Tomorrow's budget builds on that.

JOURNALIST

Infrastructure Australia has previously released a list of projects which it says deserves funding. I  know that the AIS and Commonwealth Bridge project in Canberra are on that list, we haven't seen  funding for those. Why have these projects been funded instead? Is it because you're using this  program to help boost, maybe, the Canberra Liberals chances in an electorate they need to win?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

We've taken on board the priority lists of the Governments of the day and we've made sure that we  want taxpayers' dollars being put to best value. That's what we're doing here. Those other projects  that you mentioned through Infrastructure Australia, well we can look at those as we go forward.  We've already put on the table $100 billion of infrastructure, a record amount of money, over a  rolling 10-year period, and as one project is finished another one comes on board. We're building a





better Australia. We're building a better Canberra. That's what we do as Liberals and as Nationals.  You've just heard Alistair Coe say that there hasn't been enough done in Canberra as far as  infrastructure is concerned and he wants to turn that around. I look forward to being able to do that  after October 17 with him to make sure we've got the right infrastructure in the right places in  Canberra so that we can build a better Canberra.

JOURNALIST

You're spending a lot of money on an airport in Western Sydney but what are you doing to help ease  congestion in the area?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

We're also putting a lot of money into the Metro West, also putting a lot of money in Western  Sydney to the Prospect Highway. We're spending a considerable amount of money and the Western  Sydney Nancy Bird International Airport is making sure that there are 11,000 jobs on the ground  during construction and 28,000 direct and indirect jobs in the lifetime of the project, indeed after  construction. This is a significant driver of jobs investment and whether it's a Nancy Bird  International Airport, whether it's the Metro West, they're generating thousands upon thousands of  jobs, both direct and indirect and not just on the work site themselves but in so many different  sectors and so many different areas. That's why I've worked closely with the members for Western  Sydney to ensure - Melissa McIntosh and others - to ensure that the right investment is there for  Western Sydney. It's one of the growing areas of Australia. We want to make sure it can be its best  self. Yes.

JOURNALIST

There is a feeling among people in the area that it's sucking up a lot of the money that could be used  on projects that will help them now.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

We're busting through congestion, whether it's Western Sydney or elsewhere. We're making sure  that we've got the right investment. I've been to the airport site. They're shovelling and moving  hundreds upon hundreds of tonnes of earth every day. They're making sure that they've got jobs not  just at the airport site but right around Western Sydney. We're getting the links right. Andrew  Constance, I spoke to him last night and I've communicated with him again this morning. He's  delighted with the investments that we're doing in Western Sydney and elsewhere around New  South Wales.

JOURNALIST

Can you explain how and why the Princes Highway upgrade hasn't been targeted for this fast track -

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well we're making sure the Princes Highway has the investment it needs. We're making sure the  Pacific Highway, the Newell Highway, Singleton Bypass, all of those bypasses, highways, byways,





we're making sure that we've got the right investment. I was at the South Coast the other day talking  to people about what we need to do with Princes Highway. Yes, once we get the Pacific Highway  completed it's going to be taking priority. It's a road that obviously needs priority. We work with the  New South Wales Government, we work with State Governments. I appreciate it's not just a New  South Wales road but we work with State Governments right throughout the nation to bring about  their priorities, to work closely with them and we'll be doing that into the future.

JOURNALIST

The Treasurer says the budget is based on the assumption there will be a vaccine for COVID-19 in the  next year or so. Is that too rosy a prediction considering we don't know a vaccine will come, when it  will come, how it will come, how much it will cost?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, he's a Treasurer of hope and we're all very hopeful that we get the vaccine. All reports indicate  that it's in its late developmental stages. I know Australian universities are working very closely with  Oxford and other great institutions right around the world to develop a vaccine. I know there are  human trials going on at the moment and there is every hope that there will be a vaccine in the early  stages of next year. What we want to make sure is that all Australians know that when that vaccine  does become available and it's been properly tested, that it will be freely available not just to every  Australian but indeed to our Pacific Island friends as well, because that's so important too because  we do the right thing as a neighbouring nation to those Pacific Islands who mean so much to us as  well.

JOURNALIST

Should a budget be based on more than hope though?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

There's more than just hope in tomorrow night's budget. There's jobs, there's infrastructure, there's  investment. There's certainly going to be great investment for Canberra, for every capital city, for  every regional area in Australia. And I know as the leader of The Nationals, as somebody who's lived  in the regions all his life, that one in three Australians live in the regions and call it home.

The regions have been very strong through COVID-19 and relatively COVID free. We want to back  them to make sure that they can realise their potential and unlock even more of the potential in the  regions.

JOURNALIST

On the legislated tax cuts for high income earners, it would mean that someone earning $200,000  would get a cut of $11,000. Is that fair?

MICHAEL McCORMACK





Well we want people, whether they're high income earners or whether they're low income earners,  to be able to have more of the money that they earn to be able to spend in the economy. We've  seen, because of border closures and everything else, [car horn] - there's another toot of approval  for the money that we're bringing forward today for infrastructure. So many people are delighted  about it. But what we want to do is make sure that more Australians have more of the money that  they earn. It's their money and we want to be able to give them the opportunity and the choice to  be able to spend it. Yes, if they want to save it that's a good thing too because COVID has been able  to provide one thing, that's actually lowering household debt in some instances. That's important  too. But we need more money flowing around the economy. That's why we've invested $314 billion  of assistance and that's why we are providing tax cuts. If you look at the alternative, Labor, will they  support the tax cuts? Who knows? Labor are high taxing. We are doing an infrastructure spend to  ensure that we build ourselves out of this COVID-19 recession, to ensure that Australians can be  their best selves.

JOURNALIST

On that, are you concerned that Labor will try to stand in the way of bringing forward stage 3?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, you probably should direct that question to Anthony Albanese or Jim Chalmers. We see Jim  Chalmers is actually in denial about why the recession has hit. We came to the recession, we came  to COVID-19 in a position of strength. Labor, they wouldn't know how to spell surplus let alone  produce one. Haven't done one since 1989 that was when Duran Duran was still providing hits. I  mean Labor has no idea about how to manage the economy. We do. That's why we're making the  investments that we are announcing today.

JOURNALIST

How much of this money is -

MICHAEL McCORMACK

$7.5 billion, it's new money. It's new money.

JOURNALIST

That's not out of the pool that you've already announced?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

It's new money. It's new money going forward. We are backing our infrastructure plan. We have a  $100 billion record amount of infrastructure. Anthony Albanese was in infrastructure for years,  never had that amount of money let alone the new money that we're providing today.

JOURNALIST





Just to clarify, the $7.5 billion is on top of the $100 billion?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Correct.



JOURNALIST

It was revealed on the weekend that a large chunk, I think it was more than half of the Urban  Congestion Fund has been unspent. Will this infrastructure announcement be another example of  the Government overpromising and underdelivering?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well we work with States too and we expect them to do their fair share of heavy lifting. Certainly  when it comes to whether it's urban infrastructure, urban congestion busting, we've done a lot.  We're making sure that we do provide a lot of the urban congestion busting infrastructure that we  said we're going to. But obviously we work with States, some States are better than others. I look  forward to working with the new Chief Minister Alistair Coe here in Canberra to build a better  Canberra and I took forward to working certainly with Deb Frecklington in Queensland after October  31 to build a better Queensland.

JOURNALIST

So are you saying the under spend is entirely the fault of the States?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

No, I'm not saying that at all. What I'm saying is that we have to work with States for many of these  infrastructure projects and we also, let's not forget, have had a considerable bushfire element. We  have had a considerable COVID element. That has placed stresses and strains on every sector of the  economy, finding the right people in the right places.

What we want to do is make sure that Australians know there are jobs there, certainly in the  construction sector, certainly in agriculture, certainly in the resources and mining and 45,600 jobs  identified by the Regional Australia Institute in regional Australia. So there are jobs there. We're  backing them. Tomorrow night's budget is going to be a jobs, jobs, jobs budget. I urge and encourage  those Australians who perhaps have found themselves on the welfare queues for the first time in  their careers to look around. There are jobs there. We urge and encourage them to take them and  we'll do everything that we can to support them during this crisis.

JOURNALIST

What are you going to do to make sure that the States actually spend the money and spend it  quickly?

MICHAEL McCORMACK







I've spoken and communicated with each and every one of my State and Territory Infrastructure  Transport Ministers overnight. I've spoken to many of them again this morning and indeed many of  the Opposition Leaders. They're delighted. They're backing our infrastructure spend. Given their  delight, given their support, given their positivity, let's have this team Australia moment. Let's use  this $7.5 billion, this moment right here and now, to build a better Australia, to build on the jobs and  to get out of this COVID recession.

JOURNALIST

Are you going to impose time limits or is there anything in place to make sure they actually spend it  on time?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, we'll be working with them and with some of the announcements tomorrow, I don't want to  pre-empt anything that the Treasurer is going to say, but with some of the components there will be,  of course, time limits. We do want money to hit the ground. That's why many of the projects are  shovel ready, they're ready to go. Many of the 82 new projects are ready to go. Of course, the 33  existing projects, well they're already under way and we want to fast track those.

JOURNALIST

Minister, what assurance do you give to the public that this record infrastructure spend will be spent  prudently considering that we're still not sure exactly that the issues from the Leppington Triangle,  the ANA report, those issues haven't been addressed. You haven't been able to say that you have  confidence in the Infrastructure Department that those issues have been addressed.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

I've got every confidence in the Infrastructure Department. Look, the Leppington Triangle, yes, it was  way over the odds. That's why we're doing a review on it. Of course I'm disappointed that we spent  way too much money and we're making sure that there is a review so that that does not occur again.  That said, in years to come, we own the land now and when they do build upon the Nancy Bird  Airport, already a $5.5 billion spend, already supporting 11,000 jobs, already going to support the  premises, the 28,000 jobs through the life of the project after construction's completed, but we now  own the land for future runway expansion, for future development, for future infrastructure.

But the money that we spent was way too much. We acknowledge that. The Prime Minister's  acknowledged that. The Infrastructure Minister at the time has also acknowledged that and that's  why there is an independent review into that process to ensure it doesn't happen again.

JOURNALIST

How do we know that it won't happen again? How do you know this spend won't be 10 times over  the odds?

MICHAEL McCORMACK







Well, we're doing a review to ensure that this doesn't happen again, and the Infrastructure  Department is looking at its processes and protocols to ensure it doesn't happen again.

JOURNALIST

Do you want that report to be made public when it's completed?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, the right measures will be put into place to ensure that it doesn't happen again.

JOURNALIST

Do you want to see it made public though?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

I'll be having those discussions with the Infrastructure Secretary. I'll be having those discussions  going forward. But the premise is that we've spent way too much money. The premise is that in time  at least we own the land so for future expansion of the Western Sydney Airport that will be at least  in Commonwealth property, such that we don't have to re-invest and probably spend a considerably  more money than we otherwise would have had we not bought the land now.

JOURNALIST

Will the tax cuts be - specifically the stage 2 tax cuts, will they be back-dated to July 1?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

You don't have long to go - tomorrow night, 7:30, the Treasurer is going to make all those sorts of  announcements and many more besides. It's going to be a jobs, jobs and jobs, infrastructure,  infrastructure, infrastructure budget. He'll be addressing those tax cuts matters but rest assured  Liberals and Nationals are about tax cuts. Labor, well they're about higher energy prices. They're  about less infrastructure. They're about more taxes. That's the difference. You'll see it tomorrow  night when Josh Frydenberg addresses the Parliament and addresses the nation at 7:30. I'm looking  forward to it. I know so many other Australians are too. It's been a very difficult year. That's not to  say that the budget is going to be the panacea for all ills but rest assured Liberals and Nationals will  always have Australian's backs. Rest assured we'll always make sure that we create the parameters  around which there will be more job creation. We want to back small businesses. We want to back  individuals. That's why we want to bring tax cuts forward. That's why we've already got the lowest  tax rate since 1940. I'm looking to October 17 when Alistair Coe gets elected as the Chief Minister for  the ACT and I'm very much looking forward to continuing to work with Senator Seselja on building a  better Australia.

Thank you very much.
