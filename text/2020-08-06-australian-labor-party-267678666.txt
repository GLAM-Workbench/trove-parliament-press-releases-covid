WHERE IS SCOTT MORRISON’S CQ MANUFACTURING PLAN?



Central Queensland urgently needs a jobs plan from the Morrison Government and

manufacturing should be at its centre.



Creating jobs is the key to the region recovering from this first recession in 30 years.



The Palaszczuk Labor Government has a clear plan for recovery, but we’re still waiting for

one from the Morrison Government.



Across the Capricornia and Flynn electorates more than 6,800 workers have lost their jobs

since December, while another 21,000 are just holding on through JobKeeper, which is set

to be lowered in September.



The manufacturing industry in Gladstone and throughout the region is renowned, and with

the right Federal support, Central Queensland is front-and-centre to benefit from massive

jobs growth through driving down energy costs with renewables.



Through meetings with local businesses and community groups, it’s clear Central

Queenslanders have great ideas for how to skill up workers, create jobs and invest in

manufacturing.



They’ve got the ideas, what they need now is for the Morrison Government to stop holding



them back and get on board.



Instead Scott Morrison and the LNP have cut cut $3 billion from TAFE and cut 3,219

apprenticeships and traineeships in Central Queensland since coming to power seven

years ago.



The Morrison Government must tell Central Queensland businesses what the plan is to get

the region through the COVID-19 crisis.



And it must do it sooner, rather than later.
