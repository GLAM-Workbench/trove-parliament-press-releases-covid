STATEMENT ON THE FACEBOOK NEWS BAN





Independent Member for Clark, Andrew Wilkie, says he’s surprised by the poor judgement  shown by social media platform Facebook in removing Australian news content from its site.

“While I would certainly not recommend using Facebook as a primary source for credible and  trustworthy news, it does fulfil a useful function for many by connecting them to reputable  providers such as local newspapers and dedicated news websites,” he said today.

“For many users, it is often a first stop for easy access to important information like time-critical  bushfire alerts, updates on COVID restrictions, and weather warnings issued by the Bureau of  Meteorology.

“Denying users access to timely and accurate news because Facebook doesn’t want to share  revenue with legitimate media outlets is nothing short of socially irresponsible.

“Given the ban has been timed to coincide with the passage of the media bargaining code through  the Lower House of Federal Parliament, it is impossible to view this as anything other than a  digital middle finger from a social media giant that clearly doesn’t want to play by the rules.

“Being a big American company does not give Facebook the right to act like a bully or to think it  is a law unto itself in Australia.”
