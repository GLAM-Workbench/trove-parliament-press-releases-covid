HEALTH AND STIMULUS PACKAGES SUPPORT VETERAN COMMUNITY

THE Government is doing everything it can to protect our nation from the health and economic  impacts of this global health issue, including veterans and their families.

Minister for Veterans’ Affairs Darren Chester said veterans and their families will benefit from the  Government’s commitment of $2.4 billion to bolster the nation’s health system in response to  COVID-19 as this situation evolves.

“The health package allows older and at-risk veterans to access some health consultations and  assessments remotely, via video or phone where video is not available,” Mr Chester said.

“In the event veterans are in home isolation or from a vulnerable patient group, they will also be  able to have their Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) prescriptions filled online or  remotely and have their medication delivered directly to their home.

“This ensures vulnerable veterans can access the health care they need while limiting the risk of  exposure.

“Veterans in residential or home care will be supported by the Government’s commitment of over  $100 million to upskill and increase the numbers of aged care staff and nurses.”

In addition, more than 225,000 veterans and their dependants will benefit from the $17.6 billion  stimulus package announced by the Government yesterday.

“Many of our veterans receive benefits through the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) and the  stimulus package announced by the Prime Minister and Treasurer will support our veteran  community through this challenging time,” Mr Chester said.

“Those veterans or dependants who receive income support or compensation benefits through DVA  as listed below and who are currently residing in Australia, will receive the one-off payment of $750.

“The payment will be automatically paid into bank accounts and will come from DVA or Services  Australia, however, recipients are encouraged to confirm their bank details are current and up-to-date by calling DVA on 1800 555 254.

“The Government is committed to putting veterans and their families first, particularly with regards  to the health and economic impacts of this global health issue.”
