INTEGRITY FOR STUDENTS, BUT NOT FOR MINISTERS



The Morrison Government has established an integrity unit for higher education in

Melbourne at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, it has blamed

COVID-19 for the failure to introduce its integrity commission for politicians and

bureaucrats.



In December 2018 Mr Porter and Mr Morrison claimed to have been working on “a robust,

resourced, real system that will protect the integrity of Commonwealth and public

administration” since January 2018.



Mr Porter repeatedly blamed the COVID pandemic for his failure to release the draft bill,

despite revelations in Senate Estimates today that the Attorney-General had been

provided with the draft bill on December 23 2019 - months before the pandemic.





However, at the height of the pandemic, the Morrison Government established a Higher

Education Integrity Unit to look into matters including students cheating in exams.



How did the Morrison Government have time to set up a Higher Education Integrity Unit, in

Melbourne, in the middle of pandemic but not a National Integrity Commission?



How did the Morrison Government have time, in the middle of a pandemic, to set up a

Higher Education Integrity Unit to monitor the integrity of students, but not a National

Integrity Commission to look into sports rorts, the airport land ripoff, the water buy backs

scandal, forged documents, and branch stacking?



Today’s evidence confirms the Morrison Government has no interest in integrity or fighting

corruption and is using the COVID crisis as an excuse.



The integrity commission promised by Mr Morrison and Mr Porter was so weak, ineffective

and opaque it would be unable to instigate independent inquiries, to hold public hearings,

or even investigate any of the multiple past scandals of the Morrison Government.



The ever-growing list of scandals surrounding the Morrison Government shows why

Australia needs a powerful and independent Audit Office, and a powerful and independent

National Integrity Commission - and why Mr Morrison and his colleagues will do everything

in their power to crush both of them.
