COVID-19: Senior Australians urged to stay vigilant

Senior Australians have been urged to stay vigilant as the fight to contain the spread of



COVID-19 continues.



While the easing of restrictions across most States and Territories means those aged



over 65 can start re-engaging in community, senior Victorians should closely follow



advice as authorities work to contain emerging clusters.



It comes as the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) updated its



advice for the management of health risk as COVID-19 measures lift.



Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians Richard Colbeck said vulnerable and



older members of every community remained a priority as both Federal and State



governments navigated the challenges of the pandemic.



There remains a substantial increase in risk of severe COVID-19 illness in people aged



over 70.



“We are not through the woods yet but support measures are in place to ensure senior



Australians across the country get the support they need,” Minister Colbeck said.



“We continue to monitor the situation in Victoria and will offer advice as both tiers of



government work together to stop the spread and save lives.”



He said elsewhere the stable low number of cases of COVID-19 has permitted



progressive relaxation of travel and other distancing restrictions.



“The risk of becoming infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 depends on the



chance of being close to someone with COVID-19 or coming into contact with surfaces



contaminated by the virus,” Minister Colbeck said.



“Because of this, the local pattern of disease is the most important determinant of risk



of contracting COVID-19 illness in any community. If there are no cases or a low



number of cases and no evidence of community transmission, then the risk of exposure



is low - regardless of age or health conditions.”



Minister Colbeck said in areas outside Victoria, residents previously categorized as at



higher risk of becoming ill could return to work and recreation activity provided they



followed precautions.

Social distancing, practising good hygiene and downloading the COVIDSafe app were



all key to ensuring Australia could prevent significant second wave of infections.



“It is essential that people stay up to date,” Minister Colbeck said. “And, if case numbers



do increase, like the recent increase we’ve seen in some areas of Victoria, everyone



needs to take personal responsibility for their activities, interactions and to consider



how these might affect their exposure to COVID-19.”



Where case have increased residents should consider:



Individual risk and risk to others;



The level of transmission of COVID-19 where they live and travel; and



Which interactions and activities can happen safely or should still be postponed.



“Each person has a personal responsibility to protect themselves, to protect loved ones



and the wider community,” Minister Colbeck said.



“People will have different things that are important to them and will be comfortable



with different levels of risk.



“Travel to areas with higher case numbers, or going to events with people from areas



with higher case numbers, may increase the risk of contracting COVID-19, and people



need to carefully consider this.”



He said the Federal Government continues to be guided by the advice of the AHPC.



“We are all closely watching how the outbreak progresses in Victoria and it is important



to follow medical advice as it is updated,” Minister Colbeck said.



“We are facing an extraordinary health challenge and we need to work together to



protect the people we loved most.”



The new Older Persons COVID-19 Support Line for older Australians is available



Monday to Friday, except public holidays from 8.30am to 6.00pm on 1800 171 866.



My Aged Care can be contacted by phone on 1800 200 422 from Monday to Friday
