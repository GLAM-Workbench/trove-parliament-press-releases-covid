TASKFORCE NEEDED TO ADDRESS CREW CHANGE CRISIS



Recent cases of COVID-19 diagnosed on ships around Australia highlights the urgent

need for the Morrison Government to form a taskforce to work with industry, states, and

other nations to ensure that crew changeovers can occur regularly and safely.



The international shipping community estimates that there are more than 400,000

seafarers trapped on board ships around the world due to COVID restrictions. It is

essential that exhausted workers are provided support to return home after the expiration

of their contracts and replacements sent to their ships.



Instead of supporting workers by enabling safe and dedicated crew transfers, the Morrison

Government is failing to intervene in a system which has seen crews forced to work in

excess of 12 months at a time, with some identified as having worked for up to 18 months

straight.



In the absence of safe crew change corridors in Australia, foreign shipping operators are

diverting to hubs like Manila to change out exhausted seafarers and bring on fresh crew. In



cases like the Vega Dream in Port Hedland the crew inadvertently brought the virus on

board due to less stringent isolation standards.



Labor supports the UN and IMO protocols to establish “Green Lanes” as the only way to

ensure the ongoing integrity of our trade, our economy, and our human rights obligations.



As a maritime trading nation, Australia is reliant on shipping to import essential goods to

our nation and to deliver our exports to the rest of the world.



The Morrison Government’s inaction threatens our ports, our community, and the welfare

of thousands of international seafarers.



A cross-government taskforce must immediately be established to address these serious

issues.
