GOVERNMENT WON’T RULE OUT DRUG TESTING WOMEN OVER 55  WHO RECEIVE UNEMPLOYMENT SUPPORT

The Government has refused to rule out drug-testing women over 55 who receive  unemployment support.

The Government’s plan to drug test unemployment support recipients remains in the  parliament.

Prior to the pandemic, women over 55 represented the largest cohort receiving  unemployment support, meaning this demographic would be disproportionately impacted  by the Government’s drug testing proposal

At Senate Estimates, Labor Senator Helen Polley asked the Minister for Social Services  Senator Anne Ruston if the proposal remained government policy.

The Minister confirmed that it remained policy, but refused to confirm clarify a timeline for  when the policy would progress.

Senator Polley pressed the Minister ‘you either are going to rule it out or rule it in.’

‘I think the Australian people and particularly those who have lost their jobs during this  recession, and because of COVID-19, let alone those people that was on unemployment  before, have right to know whether or not the government is going to proceed.’

In the middle of a recession and 1.8 million people on unemployment payments by the end  of the year, it is the worst possible time for the Government roll out this policy.
