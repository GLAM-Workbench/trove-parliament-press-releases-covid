CAREER REVIVE PILOT SUPPORTING AUSTRALIAN BUSINESSES  TO RECRUIT WOMEN IN REGIONAL AREAS

The Morrison Government is continuing to help skilled women across regional Australia get  back into the workforce with a second intake of businesses in the Career Revive pilot  initiative.

The initiative aims to increase women’s workforce participation by supporting businesses to  attract and retain women returning to work after a career break.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said the Morrison Government is committed to getting people back into work and  rebuilding the economy in the wake of COVID-19.

“Increasing women's workforce participation is an economic and social priority for Australia  going forward,” Minister Cash said.

“This has wide-ranging benefits not just for women, but for their families, communities,  business and our nation’s economy.”

Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Women, Senator the Hon Marise Payne, said  we are committed to boosting the confidence of women returning to paid work and their  financial independence, as well as supporting businesses to retain skilled women workers.

“This initiative is one of a range of measures under our 2018 Women’s Economic Security  Statement, which invested $119.2 million to improve women’s workforce participation and  economic security,” Minister Payne said.

“Our $240.4 million 2020 Women’s Economic Security Statement further builds on the 2018  measures and complements the Government’s JobMaker Plan. We know that when women  do well both professionally and personally, our economy and nation prospers.”

Through Career Revive, 10 regional businesses will benefit from expert business  improvement advice and support provided by KPMG.

Businesses will be offered specific guidance on how to improve business practices and  policies and develop a tailored action plan to address barriers to attracting and retaining  skilled women who have been out of the workforce for an extended period.
