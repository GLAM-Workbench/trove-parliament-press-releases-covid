STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH THAILAND

Australia has a longstanding friendship with Thailand, stretching back to the establishment of diplomatic  relations in 1952.

Today, with my Thai counterpart, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, I have elevated our relationship to  that of a Strategic Partnership.

In view of the evolving strategic shifts in the region, through this Strategic Partnership we will enhance  cooperation in key areas, including defence and security, cyber affairs, anti-money laundering and  combating transnational crime.

This historic announcement delivers on a joint commitment that Prime Minister Prayut and I made at  the East Asia Summit last year in Bangkok.

Ahead of tomorrow’s East Asia Summit, hosted by Vietnam in virtual format, today’s announcement will  strengthen our engagement on economic recovery, political and security cooperation, and in the  Mekong.

Thailand is a top-10 trading partner and a natural leader within ASEAN. Our trading relationship will  grow even more important as both countries recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
