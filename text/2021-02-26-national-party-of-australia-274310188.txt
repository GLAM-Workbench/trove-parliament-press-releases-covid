INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA'S 2021 PRIORITY LIST WELCOMED

The Australian Government has welcomed today’s release of Infrastructure Australia’s (IA) 2021 update to  its Infrastructure Priority List, showcasing the Government’s commitment to deliver nation-defining  infrastructure while helping inform future investment priorities for all levels of government.

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development Michael  McCormack said the Priority List seamlessly couples with Australia’s infrastructure-led economic recovery  from the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The Priority List drew on 124 new submissions received since the last edition’s release in August 2020,  highlighting a $59 billion pipeline of investments for nationally significant priorities across a range of  sectors including transport, energy, water, communications, housing and education,” the Deputy Prime  Minister said.

“I am pleased to see a strong focus on economic development in regional communities, with projects  such as the Federally-funded Parkes Bypass highlighted by IA as a priority corridor which will deliver long-term benefits for the freight operators, farmers and manufacturers of the region.

“Corridor-focused improvements mean reduced travel times and improved freight productivity as this  Government continues to support priority projects like these, ensuring goods get to market and drivers  get home sooner and safer.

“The Priority List helps inform future Australian Government investments as we continue to deliver on our  10-year, $110 billion infrastructure plan which is laying the foundations for economic recovery following  the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts Paul Fletcher said the Priority List  informs all levels of government and the private sector on what priority projects and initiatives are under  development across the country.

“The Infrastructure Priority List provided important input into the Government’s considerations on which  major national infrastructure projects should receive federal funding,” Minister Fletcher said.

“The Government has already committed to many of the initiatives on the list, which are helping bust  congestion, increase road safety and improve travel times in both regional and urban areas.

“I am particularly pleased to see the addition of many projects in fast-growing cities to the list, such as the  Armadale Road Bridge, following the assessment by IA as having the potential to improve congestion and  decrease travel time due to pressure from expected population growth and is an existing Government  funding commitment.”

Projects on the list already supported by the Government include:

Ã¯ÂÂ· $149 million for New South Wales’ Parkes Bypass;  Ã¯ÂÂ· $120 million for New South Wales’ Prospect Highway upgrade:  Ã¯ÂÂ· $207 million towards Western Australia’s Armadale Road Bridge;  Ã¯ÂÂ· $681 million for Western Australia’s Bunbury Outer Ring Road;  Ã¯ÂÂ· $137 million for Australian Capital Territory’s Commonwealth Avenue Bridge upgrade.

Infrastructure Australia is the Government's national infrastructure advisory body, with a key role in  assessing business cases for major projects seeking Australian Government funding and maintaining the  Infrastructure Priority List to inform future government and private sector investment decisions.

IA’s Infrastructure Priority List is available at www.infrastructureaustralia.gov.au/infrastructure-priority-list.

Ends.
