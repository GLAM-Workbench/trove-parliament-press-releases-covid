ROYAL COMMISSION INTO AGED CARE QUALITY AND SAFETY

FINAL REPORT



The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety’s final report and its 148

recommendations makes it absolutely clear - the aged care system is in crisis.



The Royal Commission has now highlighted graphically the tragic outcomes of Scott

Morrison’s neglect including maggots in wounds and up to half of residents being

malnourished.



The Coalition Government has neglected older Australians, aged care residents and workers

for years - it's a national disgrace.



Labor will take time to digest and work our way through the recommendations of the Royal

Commission.



Scott Morrison is responsible for the aged care system. He is responsible for the $1.7 billion in

federal funding cuts and the terrible systemic neglect identified by the Royal Commissioners.



How could Australians trust Scott Morrison to fix his aged care crisis?



Scott Morrison was asleep at the wheel when 685 older Australians died in aged care homes

during last year’s Coronavirus outbreak.



Older Australians built this country. They and the families who love them deserve so much

better than the chaotic, unsafe system that has evolved under Scott Morrison.



Aged care workers want to provide quality care for their residents, but they are exhausted,

undervalued and stretched to their limit and as we saw during the pandemic, they lack the

resources they need to take care of vulnerable older Australians.



If you are an older Australian who wants safe and compassionate treatment in aged care; if

you want to know your parents and grandparents are safe and properly cared for in our aged

care system; if you are an aged care worker wanting adequate resources to look after older

Australians in your care, Labor is on your side.



Labor has always been the Party of aged care. Only a Labor Government will fix this crisis and

give older Australians the care they deserve.
