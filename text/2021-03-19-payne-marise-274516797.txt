MEDIA RELEASE  HIGH COMMISSIONER TO KIRIBATI

Today I announce the appointment of Mr David Yardley as Australia’s next High  Commissioner to Kiribati.

Australia and Kiribati work together to promote a secure and resilient Pacific region,  collaborating to address shared climate change, education, health, gender equality,  disability and infrastructure challenges. Kiribati workers are valued participants in  Australia’s labour mobility programs.

Australia recognises Kiribati’s success in remaining free of COVID-19, and navigating  the health, economic and social challenges of the pandemic. Australia has been proud  to assist the Kiribati government to respond, including through budget support, civil  society grants and supply of essential medicines. Australia will also support Kiribati to  access safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.

Security is a key element of our partnership, with a focus on the maritime domain. In  2021, we look forward to supplying a new Guardian-Class Patrol Boat to bolster  monitoring of Kiribati’s exclusive economic zone, alongside aerial surveillance. These  measures support strong revenues for Kiribati from its abundant fisheries resources.

Mr Yardley is a career officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)  and was most recently Counsellor at Australia’s Mission to the then United Nations,  New York. He previously served overseas in Kabul, and on secondment in the UK  Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

Mr Yardley holds a Master of Philosophy from the University of Cambridge; a Bachelor  of Laws and a Bachelor of Science from the University of Sydney.

I thank outgoing High Commissioner Bruce Cowled for his contributions to advancing Australia’s  interests in Kiribati since 2016.
