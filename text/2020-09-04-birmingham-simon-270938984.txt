NEW TASKFORCE TO CREATE JOBS BY ATTRACTING BUSINESS AND TALENT  TO AUSTRALIA

International businesses will be lured to Australia and exceptional talent will be encouraged  to call Australia home under a new initiative to support the post-COVID recovery and boost  local jobs.

The new, whole-of-government Global Business and Talent Attraction Taskforce will bring  together experts from across the Commonwealth, States and Territories as well as the  private sector, as part of the Government’s JobMaker plan.

Senior business leader, Peter Verwer AO, has been appointed as the head of the Taskforce  and will be known as the Prime Minister’s Special Envoy for Global Business and Talent  Attraction.

The Taskforce will operate as a ‘strike team’ to turbo-charge the creation of jobs by boosting  our efforts to attract high value global business and exceptional talent.

The initial focus will be on three key sectors: advanced manufacturing, financial services  (including FinTech) and health.

Australia is strategically well positioned given its management of the pandemic and our  relatively strong economy. We have always been an attractive destination due to our lifestyle,  democratic system, clean cities and proximity to Asia. We can use those advantages to bring  more global business and talent to our shores and help create more Australian jobs.

Acting Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs Alan  Tudge said the global context had significantly changed and many talented people and  businesses will now be looking to places like Australia.

“Australia has always been an attractive destination for talent and investment, but given our  relative success economically, from a health perspective, and socially, we will be even more  attractive.

“We want to capitalise on this and be very focussed on attracting key businesses and global  super talent to Australia.  This will aid our recovery and boost jobs for Australians.”

“The Taskforce will take a whole-of-government approach, including coordinating closely with  State Government initiatives.  We will be leveraging our networks abroad, including the  Australian diaspora, to help identify opportunities.”

Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Simon Birmingham said luring more investment  from global businesses in emerging industries would be a critical part of Australia’s overall  economic recovery from COVID-19.

“Through this taskforce and the ongoing work of Austrade we will highlight to global  businesses that our overall economic management and handling of the COVID-19 pandemic  strengthens our reputation as a stable and attractive investment destination,” Minister  Birmingham said.

“As our economy continues to transform, attracting talent and investment will be critical to  bringing additional business nous and new technologies to help drive growth in the  development of high-value goods and services in emerging industries.

“With one in 10 jobs already supported by foreign direct investment, boosting investment and  getting more global businesses to set up shop here will help drive more jobs and  opportunities for Australians.”

On 9 July, the Prime Minister announced that Australia would develop incentives to attract  export orientated Hong Kong based businesses to relocate to Australia.

This initiative builds on this idea, and the Global Talent and Business Innovation and  Investment programs, to attract high value businesses and exceptionally talented individuals  to Australia to create jobs for Australians.

The Taskforce will join up the Department of Home Affairs with the Australian Trade and  Investment Commission (Austrade), and draw on expertise from the Treasury, the  Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Industry, Science, Energy and Resources,  Defence, and the Department of Education, Skills and Employment.

They will work closely with the States and Territories, industry leaders and specialists in  identifying and executing opportunities.
