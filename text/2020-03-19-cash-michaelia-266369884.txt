EMPLOYMENT GROWTH IN FEBRUARY 2020

The Morrison Government welcomes the ABS labour force figures released today exceeding  market expectations in February 2020, with employment increasing by 26,700 over the  month, to stand at a record high, of more than 13 million.

Over the year to February 2020, employment has risen by 256,300 (or 2.0 per cent), above  the decade average growth rate, of 1.8 per cent.

Whilst these figures do not reflect the economic impact of the spread of COVID-19, it shows  the strength of Australia’s economy going into the international crisis.

Full-time employment increased by 6,700 over the month, to a record high of 8,884,600 in  February 2020, and is now 144,300 (or 1.7 per cent) higher than it was a year ago.

Full-time employment has comprised 56.3 per cent of total employment growth over the last  year.

The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell by 0.2 percentage points over the month, to   5.1 per cent in February 2020.



The Minister for Employment, Senator the Hon Michaelia Cash, welcomed today’s positive  figures noting that 1,538,400 jobs had been created since the Government came to office, an  increase of 13.4 per cent.

The Minister cautioned, however, that COVID-19 is likely to have a substantial impact on  global and domestic economic growth, as well as labour market activity, going forward.

“In order to help protect both the health and jobs of all Australians, the Morrison Government  has moved quickly to put in place scalable and sustainable measures to help cushion the  negative impact of the coronavirus,” she said.

“Last week, we announced the first step in the recovery with a $17.6 billion economic  stimulus package to help boost investment and confidence, strengthen the economy, keep  businesses operating and support Australian jobs.”

“We do not underestimate the significant challenges resulting from COVID-19 that lie ahead.  This is why the Government stands ready to enact further measures to help strengthen the  safety net, bolster the economy’s defences and protect Australian businesses and jobs.”

The Federal Government will continue to work collaboratively with the experts and our State  and Territory counterparts, in order to respond decisively and effectively to the health and  economic challenges that confront us during this pandemic.
