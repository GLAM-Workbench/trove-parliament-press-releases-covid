THE HON. CHRISTIAN PORTER MP  Attorney-General  Minister for Industrial Relations  Leader of the House



Media Release   Wednesday, 9th December 2020  Industrial relations reform - supporting jobs and our economic recovery   The Morrison Government’s vital reforms to the industrial relations system are driven by one simple goal - breaking down the barriers to job growth so that we can get Australians back to work.  The reforms were developed after extensive consultation with employer and employee groups who sat down with the Government for more than 150 hours to find innovative solutions that will support struggling businesses, as well as protect and enhance the rights of workers.  The Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia’s Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2020 is the end product of that process, representing the most substantial reforms to Australia’s industrial system since the Fair Work Act was introduced in 2009.   The Bill contains a range of practical measures targeting five key areas of the IR system: Ã¯ÂÂ· Award simplification - Cutting red tape, improving flexibility and job opportunities in 12 Awards covering the retail and hospitality sectors, which were hit hard by the pandemic and saw heavy job losses; Ã¯ÂÂ· Greenfields agreements - Boosting investment in job-creating mega-projects by making them more attractive to global investors through new maximum eight-year life-of-construction agreements, complete with appropriate safeguards and guaranteed wage increases; Ã¯ÂÂ· Casual employment - Ending the confusion and uncertainty surrounding the legal status of casuals, while providing a clearer pathway for those working regular shifts to convert to permanent roles after 12 months if they wish to do so; Ã¯ÂÂ· Enterprise Bargaining - Reversing the decline in agreement making by simplifying the BOOT test and setting a 21-day approval deadline to help drive productivity gains and real wage growth; Ã¯ÂÂ· Compliance and enforcement - Reducing the risk of wage underpayments by helping employers comply with their obligations, providing improved mechanisms to rectify underpayments where they do occur, and protecting employee entitlements by introducing a new criminal penalty with a four-year jail term for the very small number of employers who deliberately exploit their workers.  Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations, Christian Porter, said the reforms were not radical or driven by ideology. They represent a fair and balanced response to problems that all sides of the debate agree must be fixed in order to give employers the confidence to invest and get Australians back to work.

“The economic supports put in place by the Morrison Government, such as the JobKeeper and  JobSeeker payments, ensured that the Australian economy fared significantly better than most during  the pandemic and there are already positive signs that we are starting to bounce back strongly,” the  Attorney-General said.

“But our success has not been without pain for many workers who have lost jobs or lost working  hours. Regrowing those jobs - especially in some of our hardest hit industries such as the retail and  hospitality sectors - is an enormous challenge that our IR reforms will help us to meet.

“I again want thank all of those who participated in a genuine spirit of cooperation during the working  group process, which was invaluable in helping to define the problems and inform the solutions that  are contained in the Bill to be introduced to Parliament today.

“It should also be said that the introduction of the Bill today is by no means the end of the  consultation process, with a Senate Committee likely to examine the legislation in detail over the  coming months.

“This is an opportunity for further submissions to be made by all sides of the debate and the  Government will be willing to consider any sensible amendments that pass the simple test of being  good for job growth.

“The danger is that if those inside and outside the Parliament revert to their traditional ideological  corners, these critical reforms could be delayed or even blocked, leaving business without crucial  supports and workers without an opportunity to get back into jobs.”

The Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia’s Jobs and  Economic Recovery) Bill 2020

How the Bill supports Australia’s jobs and economic recovery  The Bill contains six main schedules, the first five dealing with the key areas for reform, plus an  additional schedule outlining new measures designed to support the Fair Work Commission.

Schedule 1 - Casual Employees

Measures in the Bill will ensure businesses have the confidence to engage casual staff without fear of  being exposed to some future liability that may jeopardise their sustainability, while ensuring  employees have pathways to more secure and permanent employment.

Recent court outcomes such as the Rossato decision have made it very difficult to be certain of an  employee’s status - even if the parties follow the award or agreement definition. The Bill will address  these issues by:  Ã¯ÂÂ· Legislating a new statutory definition of casual employment - something Labor inexplicably

neglected to do when the Act was drafted in 2009.  Ã¯ÂÂ· A person will be considered a casual employee if they accept an offer of employment where there  is no ‘advance commitment’ of ongoing work.   Ã¯ÂÂ· To ensure certainty for businesses and their employees, an exhaustive list of indicators of what

constitutes ‘no firm advance commitment’ will be provided.    Ã¯ÂÂ· A new, broad based casual conversion right. It will require employers to assess all casual  employees once they have been employed for 12 months and, if appropriate, offer them

conversion to full-time or part-time employment.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Casual employees who choose not to convert, or are not made an offer, can request casual  conversion at a later stage provided they meet the eligibility criteria.  Ã¯ÂÂ· In conjunction with greater flexibility for part time employees, this is likely to see more use of part

time employment, and less need to engage employees on a casual basis.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Needs of small business will be a key focus of new FWO communication and guidance material to  increase awareness and communication of these reforms. This will support small business in

understanding and applying the changes in their workplace.  Ã¯ÂÂ· These changes will restore confidence, particularly for small businesses, making it clearer and  simpler to engage casual employees, and providing certainty that the employment relationship

will not change over time. This will ensure businesses aren’t exposed to some future unknown  financial liability.

Schedule 2 - Award Flexibilities

It is absolutely critical that in the industries hardest-hit by COVID-19, the Government works to make  it as simple as possible to re-grow jobs, without sacrificing employee protections. Time that businesses  spend navigating our overly complex industrial relations system and its often convoluted processes, is  time that businesses don’t spend growing and creating jobs.

There are a number of critical changes we are implementing to distressed awards to assist businesses  and their employees to get back to work, including:  Ã¯ÂÂ· Legislating two of our successful COVID-19 JobKeeper flexibilities for distressed industries for a  further two years. These flexibilities, which have already saved thousands of jobs during the

pandemic, will allow employers and employees to continue to work together regarding their  duties and location of work to navigate the challenges of working in a post-COVID world.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Legislating increased access to part-time flexibility that will allow an employee to agree to take on  additional hours when it suits them, subject to important safeguards. This measure will help to

2



reduce employer reliance on casual staff and give part-time workers who want more hours the  chance to earn more each week.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Working through FWC processes to modify key distressed awards by simplifying classifications and  introducing loaded rates and/or exemption rates to make it easier for small businesses in

particular to create jobs and get these hard-hit industries moving again.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Establishing a co-design process for the FWC, FWO, employer groups & unions to design a “Reg  Tech” product that will make it simpler for employers to pay their staff and employ more people.    Ã¯ÂÂ· Through a consultative review process, identifying common and duplicative award terms that

should be migrated to the NES to simplify the awards system and buttress the legislated safety  net.

Schedule 3 - Enterprise Agreements

Unions and employers know the enterprise bargaining system is broken and want it fixed. The  Government has harnessed that agreement to produce a range of reforms that will make bargaining a  more viable option, and encourage employers and employees to unlock the benefits of higher  productivity and higher wages - as the system was designed to achieve.

The bill contains measures that will speed up the approvals process, reduce complexity, focus on  cooperation between the parties, give weight to the bargained outcome, and reduce the risks of  failure and delays on narrow technical grounds. A quicker and easier process will encourage more  businesses to return to bargaining and make best use of the opportunity to achieve productivity  improvements, pay higher wages and create jobs. The major changes include:  Ã¯ÂÂ· Making it easier for businesses and their employees to make agreements that suit their needs by

revising the better off overall test (BOOT) in the following ways:   o removing consideration of hypothetical scenarios; regard will only be had to work patterns  that are in place or are reasonably foreseeable,   o in considering whether the BOOT has been met, require the FWC to give significant weight

to the parties’ views, and  o placing emphasis on monetary and non-monetary improvements for employees.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Legislating to require all agreements to be approved as far as practicable within 21 working days.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Limiting the ability of non-bargaining parties to intervene at the approval stage.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Give the FWC discretion in limited circumstances to approve an agreement that is not BOOT-

compliant, taking into account the views and circumstances of the parties, COVID-19 impacts and  the extent of support for the agreement, where it is in the public interest to do so (limited to  maximum two years’ duration). This provision will sunset automatically after 2 years of  commencement;  Ã¯ÂÂ· Replacing the existing prescriptive technical test for a genuine agreement with a simple test that

focuses on the substance of the agreement making process.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Restricting when an application to terminate an expired agreement can be made.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Requiring ‘zombie agreements’ from the early 2000s to cease by 1 July 2022.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Reviewing the existing low-paid bargaining stream process.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Tasking the FWC to address pain points in the agreement making process, including through the

adoption of tech solutions, which will make the bargaining process easier to navigate, and the  consideration and approval of agreements faster and more efficient.



Schedule 4 - Greenfields Agreements  By providing certainty about workplace conditions during the construction phase of mega-projects, we  can incentivise global investment in more job-creating Australian initiatives. This change will ensure  that the nominal term of greenfields agreements can better match the construction length of major  projects, preventing the need for costly re-negotiation of agreements part-way through projects. The  changes to greenfields agreements include:

3



Ã¯ÂÂ· Allowing up to eight year greenfields agreements for major construction projects valued over $500  million, or projects above $250 million where there is national, regional or employment growth  significance.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Ensuring greenfields agreements that are greater than 4 years provide for annual wage increases  for the nominal term of the agreement.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Separate to the Bill, the Government will also support improvements to mental health for fly-in  fly-out and drive-in drive-out workers, who are often employed on greenfields agreements.

Schedule 5 - Compliance and Enforcement   We must work to create a system that is easier to comply with, so businesses have the confidence to  spend more time growing their business and creating jobs, and to ensure employees receive their  correct entitlements. The Bill contains a number of enhanced safeguards for employees, as well as for  those employers who do the right thing, but face being undercut by unscrupulous operators:

Ã¯ÂÂ· A new criminal offence for the most egregious forms of deliberate, dishonest and systematic  underpayments of one or more employees, punishable by up to 4 years imprisonment and/or  significant fines up to $5.55 million

Ã¯ÂÂ· Increases to existing Fair Work Act maximum civil penalties for underpayments, building on the  10-fold increase to penalties for serious contraventions we already introduced since coming to  Government.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Introducing a new ‘benefit obtained’ penalty for medium and large businesses - where the  maximum penalty for an underpayment could be two times the benefit gained through the  underpayment, or three times for serious contraventions, bringing the workplace system into line  with other jurisdictions like corporations and consumer law

Ã¯ÂÂ· Increase the maximum penalties for sham contracting, infringement notices and not complying  with a compliance notice.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Prohibiting employers from advertising jobs specifying pay rates that are below minimum wage.

The government also recognises that the vast majority of underpayments are not deliberate and that  the key is for employers, especially those in small business, to be given greater assistance to help them  understand and comply with their obligations, avoid making genuine mistakes or rectify them where  they do occur. We will do this through a number of important new measures and initiatives:   Ã¯ÂÂ· Additional funding will be provided to the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) to ensure its role is

better understood by employers and employees so it can deliver the best possible guidance and  services to make understanding and abiding by obligations as easy as possible.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Working with industry to design a new, free ‘Employer Advisory Service’ from the FWO that will  make it easier for small business to comply with their obligations by seeking advice from the

regulator in the knowledge they will not be subject to legal action if they have acted honestly and  followed the FWO’s advice.1   Ã¯ÂÂ· Codifying regulator’s enforceable undertaking powers and instituting a Deferred Litigation Process  for inadvertent underpayments that are rectified quickly and in good faith by employers.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Expanding and improving the existing small claims process, by increasing the small claims cap to

$50k, allowing courts to refer issues to the FWC for resolution via conciliation or genuine consent  arbitration and fast-tracking timeframes for resolution of underpayment issues where possible.

Schedule 6 - Fair Work Commission  The Fair Work Commission needs appropriate powers to be able to deal with vexatious applications  more effectively. This will reduce costs incurred to both responding employers and the public, and assist  the Commission in concentrating its resources on dealing with meritorious cases.  The Bill will amend the FW Act to:



1 Final detail on scope and mechanics of the provision of advice and specific consequence of good faith, detailed, and  accurate reliance to be consulted upon with employer groups and unions.

4



Ã¯ÂÂ· enable the Commission to dismiss applications that are misconceived, lacking in substance or  otherwise an abuse of the process (in addition to its existing power to dismiss applications that are  frivolous, vexatious or have no reasonable prospects of success), and

Ã¯ÂÂ· enable a Full Bench of the FWC to order a person whose application is dismissed for such reasons  not to make further applications to the FWC (including applications of a particular type, or against  a particular person).

This power is modelled on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal’s powers to deal with vexatious  applications and balances procedural fairness and the need for the FWC to minimise further appeal  avenues for vexatious litigants.  Other minor changes are made to Fair Work Commission’s powers regarding appeals and varying  decisions.
