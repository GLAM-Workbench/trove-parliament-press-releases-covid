$9.6 million in further funding to disaster proof

Queensland communities

Communities from the Torres Strait to the Gold Coast will benefit from an almost $9.6  million investment in projects to improve local disaster resilience and risk reduction.

Minister for Emergency Management David Littleproud said the 49 projects were being  delivered through the $13.1 million Queensland Resilience and Risk Reduction Fund  (QRRRF), a joint initiative between Australian and Queensland Governments.

“This funding is an important part of our whole community effort to create resilient regions  across Queensland and the country,” Minister Littleproud said.

“In the past decade, Queensland has seen more than 80 significant natural disaster events  including devastating floods, catastrophic bushfires, severe tropical cyclones, and now  COVID-19.

"We’ll never be able stop disasters from impacting the state, but by investing in resilience  and risk reduction today we can ensure Queenslander’s are better prepared for the future.

“That’s why we’re getting on the front foot with this investment to back a wide range of  projects that will lower the cost of future disasters and enable a quicker recovery.”

Examples of projects being funded through QRRRF include floodway monitoring and  warning systems for Balonne Shire Council ($528,000) and Toowoomba Regional Council  ($150,000), bushfire mitigation works on Palm Island ($322,000), and severe wind hazard  assessment for south east Queensland ($200,000).

Queensland Treasurer and Minister responsible for the Queensland Reconstruction  Authority (QRA) Cameron Dick said this QRRRF announcement adds to the $3.5 million  funded directly by the Palaszczuk Government last month.

“This $9.6 million joint funding extends support through the QRRRF program to 35  councils, three regional organisations of councils, two state frontline agencies, a non-profit  community organisation and Energy Queensland,” Mr Dick said.

“It will go towards job-creating infrastructure projects and upgrades that strengthen the  economic recovery plan our government is currently delivering for Queensland.

“As communities across Queensland continue to battle the economic impacts of COVID-19, we will continue to invest in infrastructure to boost our regions and keep  Queenslanders working and protected.”

The $13.1 million QRRRF is jointly funded by the Queensland Government ($8.3 million)  and the Australian Government ($4.8 million) and is administered by the Queensland  Reconstruction Authority.

It is the first year of a five-year National Partnership on Disaster Risk Reduction between  the Queensland and Australian Governments.
