Following consultation between the Presiding Officers, parliamentary departments and  relevant health officials, access arrangements to Australian Parliament House (APH) for the  coming sitting fortnight will remain as they were for the first sitting week this year (2-4  February).

All parliamentarians and staff travelling to the ACT for parliamentary sitting weeks and other  parliamentary commitments must apprise themselves of all COVID-19 requirements imposed  by their home state or territory as well as the requirements of the ACT. These details may be  updated so all travellers must regularly check for updated information.

In particular, those travelling from Victoria and Western Australia are reminded to regularly  check their states’ health websites before travelling to the ACT in light of ongoing  developments in these states.
