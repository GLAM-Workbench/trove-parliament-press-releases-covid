Extra funding for aged care not enough to fix aged care



The Greens say that the additional $171m in funding for aged care announced

today is way to low to fix the deep cracks in aged care and that the sector

needs an urgent $3billion injection.



There must be an immediate injection of $3 billion dollars into aged care to

increase the level and hours of care residents need, to ensure nursing and

caring staff to resident ratios provide proper levels of care for residents.



The next step is to implement recommendations designed to end clinical

failures identified by many including a Senate inquiry in April 2019.



The government had plenty of time to act before Covid arrived to overwhelm a

system that we already knew was failing our vulnerable older people and their

families. Now they have no excuses.



The PM must also update the terms of reference of the Royal Commission to

look at the impact of profit making in aged care.



Today the Federal Minister for Aged Care told the COVID Committee he

doesn't believe it's possible to keep older Australians in residential aged care



facilities Completely safe from COVID. He needs to try a bit harder.



It is very distressing to think that the scale of COVID-19 outbreaks in aged care

could have been prevented or at least not as severe if the Commonwealth

Government had done more. It is not as if they didnâ€™t know action was needed.



This outbreak is highlighting years of Governments failures to adequately fund

and support the aged care system, particularly when it comes to the workforce.
