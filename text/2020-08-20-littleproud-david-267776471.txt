National Cabinet meeting a flashpoint for our federation

Federal Agriculture Minister David Littleproud believes tomorrows National Cabinet  meeting has become a flashpoint for the future of Australia’s federation.

“Unless Premiers commit to work with one another to find workable solutions to state  border issues for regional Australians then they risk states becoming irrelevant to modern  Australia.

“State Premiers must urgently consult with one another and regional communities and  deliver practical resolutions as a priority, and not rely on city centric policy formation  forgetting a third of the country’s population and our agricultural production systems.

“While we support evidence-based restrictions to protect human health, ongoing border  restrictions on large sections of Queensland New South Wales, Victoria and South  Australia that have no COVID-19 cases are posing major challenges on agricultural supply  chains, as well as on the health and welfare of residents,” Minister Littleproud said

“Announcements made in recent days to fix cross-border issues have not been developed  in proper partnership with regional communities or don’t seem to be genuine in rectifying  the serious impacts on many families, communities, workers and industries.

“There is no point developing solutions and making announcements without consulting  with locals first or having a robust process to make them work otherwise it is an  announcement for announcement’s sake. Regional Australians are smarter than that and  are the ones that are left with unworkable solutions.

“What these city centric decisions fail to acknowledge is that modern regional Australia has  outgrown state lines, and that many regions share strong economic, social and community  links across borders.

“The integrated and connected nature of many regional economies is also exposing the  limitations of the States and these border closures are becoming a flashpoint for our  Federation and the future role and relevance of the states in our nation.

“The inability or unwillingness of our Premiers to work with each other to find common-sense and practical solutions to restrictions that they have imposed is becoming a major  test of their leadership.

“Premiers must remember that they are not just Premiers of capital cities. I urge each of  them to visit their impacted border regions as soon as possible and thrash out workable  solutions with local governments, people, businesses and organisations.

The Prime Minister wrote to Premiers on the 16th of August putting them on notice that this  matter would be raised at National Cabinet, and regional communities expect their leaders  to set aside politics and parochialism and to help, not hinder them at this critical time.
