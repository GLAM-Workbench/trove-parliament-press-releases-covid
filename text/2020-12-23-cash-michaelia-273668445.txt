EMPLOYMENT FACILITATORS TO HELP  JOB SEEKERS BACK INTO WORK

Nine new Employment Facilitators will help job seekers find work as part of the Morrison  Government’s $62.8 million Local Jobs Program.

The Employment Facilitators will work on-the-ground to support employers and job seekers  to connect with employment and training opportunities.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said Employment Facilitators will help support the nation’s recovery from COVID-19.

“The Morrison Government wants as many job seekers as possible to upskill and reskill,  using solutions developed by their local community,” Minister Cash said.

“Our Employment Facilitators will provide a local presence to support employers and job  seekers to connect to local employment and training opportunities.

“They’ll drive innovative ideas to address their region’s unique challenges by bringing  together local businesses, training providers and job seekers.

“Employment Facilitators will chair Local Jobs and Skills Taskforces in their communities,  addressing the needs of their region and identifying projects that can be funded by the  Morrison Government through the Local Recovery Fund.”

The Fund forms part of the Local Jobs Program, which is being rolled out to 25 regions  across Australia.

As well as working with employers, and providing support to retrenched workers and job  seekers, Employment Facilitators will also ensure better leverage of existing strategies, as  well as a valuable source of information on labour market developments in their region.

The nine new Employment Facilitators are in the following regions:
