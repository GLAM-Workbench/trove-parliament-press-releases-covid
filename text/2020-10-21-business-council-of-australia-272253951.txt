GROUNDED: COUNTRY LOSES $319 MILLION A DAY  21 October 2020

Australia is losing $319 million a day in domestic and international air travel according to new analysis  released today by the Business Council of Australia.

The BCA commissioned EY to undertake the analysis which shows economic fallout from the  shutdown of domestic aviation over the past seven months is $17 billion and $61 billion for  international flights.

“State border closures have seen passenger numbers on Australia’s busiest air routes plummet 91 per  cent since March, crippling the aviation sector and causing harmful knock-on effects in tourism and  hospitality,’’ Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott said.

“Every day flights remain grounded costs Australia $69 million or $2.1 billion a month. When you add  in international aviation losses at $250 million a day or $7.6 billion per month we are talking about an  enormous hit to our economy.

The fallout includes widespread job losses across the aviation sector including airlines, airports,  catering and ground handling and transport services.

More than 34,000 people nationwide have been affected by job losses and furloughed positions with  the nation’s two major carriers laying off around 11,500 employees.

“The safety of Australians remains our number one priority but states like NSW have put robust  systems in place to manage this virus, so people can safely and freely get on with their lives,” Ms  Westacott said.

“Our recovery will be stronger and faster if we can agree on a national timetable and transparent  protocols for removing domestic travel restrictions.

“We are not asking for a free for all - we need a highly-targeted, careful and gradual reopening of the  economy based on health advice with robust nationally consistent systems in place for departures and  arrivals, quarantining, local containment, and digital tracking and tracing.

“We are calling on the National Cabinet to announce a plan for domestic travel before December.  Getting Australians flying again before Christmas would be a social and economic gift to the country,  delivering an additional $3.3 billion.

“At the same time, we need to begin mapping out how we can gradually and safely remove  international travel restrictions once health conditions allow.

“International aviation generates about $100 billion a year in export revenue and supports about  515,000 jobs across the country.

“Putting a nationally agreed plan in place for international travel will allow us to ramp up this critical  sector once we get the green light.

“International aviation delivers enormous economic benefits to the country that cannot be replaced by  other sectors. It is vital to our recovery; we have to make it strong and viable.

“International students arriving by air support 240,000 jobs in the country and education exports are  worth $40.3 billion.

“On average, international visitors such as tourists, business travellers and short-term students spend  about $5,200 per trip each in Australia. Chinese travellers about $9,300. By contrast, Australians  holidaying at home spend about $700.

“Other countries are opening up their international aviation in a COVID-safe way.

“We can’t afford to be left behind and miss out on opportunities to establish safe travel corridors with  other low-risk countries who have also managed the virus well. This would generate $20.5 billion for  Australia over a 12-month period.

“We support National Cabinet adopting a strategy for increasing international travel based on a  strategy to gradually and safely re-open borders.

“This would require a commitment from all states and territories to protect the Australian community by  expanding quarantine and other safeguards using nationally agreed standards and protocols.

“This is not a temporary problem for Australia. If we fail to begin carefully reopening, we will lose our  international competitiveness and ability to attract investment and talent.’’

The analysis also shows how Australia is lagging other countries in recovering aviation activity, the  impact on agricultural exports, the hit to regional tourism and the collapse of Australia’s business  events industry.

Internal border restrictions continue to be a brake on our economic  recovery from COVID-19

In March, States and Territories imposed  unprecedented travel bans and border restrictions  to manage the pandemic.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Domestic aviation services were virtually shut  down.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ International border closures stopped entry of  foreign travellers who also use domestic  services.

While suppression of COVID-19 has been successful  in all states, many border controls remain in place.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Queensland remains closed to NSW and Victoria. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Western Australia is closed until April 2021. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Tasmania remains closed but has announced  plans to ease controls in late October.

Internal border controls have rarely been adopted  in other countries as part of their COVID responses  — Australia remains well behind other countries in  getting domestic aviation flying.

Page 3

Maintaining critical aviation  connectivity In response to COVID-19, the Australian  Government has provided emergency  support to keep essential air services  running.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Under the Domestic Aviation  Network Support, Qantas and Virgin  Australia Groups have operated a  minimum domestic network servicing  the most critical metropolitan and  regional routes in Australia.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A Regional Airline Network Support program also supports smaller  regional airlines.

Both programs were extended to early  next year under the 2020-21 Budget. It  will be critical for the sector’s recovery  that other important programs under  the Australian Airline Financial Relief  Package are able to continue until  international travel resumes.

Before COVID-19, Australia’s domestic  airline industry carried more than 65  million passengers — that’s more than 2.5  flights per person each year.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Even with the support provided by  government, our aviation sector has  been devastated by the pandemic, with  passenger volumes plummeting by 89%  this year.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We have some of the busiest air routes  in the world.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Melbourne — Sydney is the second  busiest route globally by flight  frequency with 54,000 flights in  2019.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Brisbane — Sydney had 33,000  flights in 2019.

A clear plan for restarting domestic aviation activity will build  confidence in Australia’s economic recovery

Page 7

While some progress to open aviation routes  between states has been made, there is no  roadmap for lifting travel restrictions and  reinstating our domestic aviation sector.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The lack of certainty continues to deter  business confidence, including in broader  aviation, tourism and regional Australia.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australians are being held back from making  plans to holiday and visit friends and relatives  interstate.

Economic recovery will be stronger and faster if  the timing and priorities for removing travel  restrictions are clear.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Transparent protocols for the resumption of  domestic air routes should be developed and  announced before December.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ This will help keep Australians connected, allow  people to visit family and friends, and provide  critical stimulus for the regions and our  tourism sector.

A Christmas gift to  the nation Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A strong domestic aviation network  is critical to Australia’s success,

supporting businesses and the  community.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Getting Australians flying again  before Christmas would be a social  and economic gift to the country.

The role of aviation in  Australia’s economic  recovery The economic urgency for a plan to  safely and sustainably restore  Australia’s domestic and international  air links

22 October 2020

Australia and the global community face an ongoing health and  economic crisis

Page 2

The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest  public health challenge in a century.

Ã¢ÂÂº The impact of COVID-19 on Australia’s community and

economy has been unprecedented.

Ã¢ÂÂº The crisis is still unfolding and federal and state

governments are working to manage the spread of  COVID-19.  Ã¢ÂÂº Policy responses to suppress the virus affect nearly

every citizen and business, including:

Ã¢ÂÂº Effective closing of international borders (tight

caps apply on inbound arrivals) Ã¢ÂÂº Internal border controls

Ã¢ÂÂº Quarantine standards

Ã¢ÂÂº Social distancing

Ã¢ÂÂº Widespread testing and tracing arrangements.

Ã¢ÂÂº The restrictions placed on individuals and businesses

have significantly impacted Australia’s economy.  Australia is confronting a deep recession, the first in  30 years.

Australia has led the world  in its health response to  COVID-19. But Australia’s  economic recovery hinges  on the restoration of our  domestic and international  air links.

We urgently need a plan to  safely and sustainably  restore travel in a way that  ensures the ongoing  protection of the Australian  community.

International aviation delivers a unique economic benefit to Australia  — other sections of the economy can’t compensate for its loss

Page 3

Holiday $13.3 billion

International aviation generates

around $100 billion in export  revenue and supports around

515,000 jobs.

Education $40.3 billion

VFR

$5.7 billion

Business $5.5 billion

Freight $34.5 billion

International holiday makers  spend approximately  $3,300 in Australia,  generating approximately  75,000 jobs.

Education services are  one of Australia’s largest  exports. International  students arriving by air  support around  248,000 jobs.

Passengers visiting  friends and relatives  (VFR) spend  approximately $2,300 in  Australia and support  about 32,000 jobs.

Air travel provides key trade  linkages to the world and  contributes to foreign direct  investment. Business related  air-travel creates around  31,000 jobs.

Passenger aircraft carry much  more than people. International  passenger aircraft carry over  80% of air freight  in the cargo  hold. Air freight on passenger  planes generates about  129,000 jobs.

Air travel supports many Australian industries and jobs and provides  key trade linkages to the world

Page 4

International passenger travel has declined by 95% and  more than half of the world’s flights have been  grounded. While international borders remain closed,  Australia is losing $7.6 billion per month in  economic value.

Ã¢ÂÂº The flow of tourists, overseas students, business

travellers and air freight to Australia has been  profoundly disrupted.

Ã¢ÂÂº Agricultural exports are among the high value

exports constrained due to COVID-19 international  travel restrictions.

Ã¢ÂÂº Air freight beef and sheep meat exports declined

by 13% and 34% respectively in 2020 compared  to 2019.

Ã¢ÂÂº Over 75% of seafood exports are airfreighted,

with the value of lobster exports declining by  around 36% in 2020 compared to 2019.

Ã¢ÂÂº The International Freight Assistance Mechanism

(IFAM) has been a crucial action by Government to  maintain international trade and must continue.  However the only way for air freight to rebound is  with greater capacity through passenger aircraft.

Higher domestic tourism  from Australians holidaying  at home will not offset  tourism and trade losses  due to the dislocation of  international air travel.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ On average, international visitors  (e.g. tourists, business travellers and  short term students) spend $5200 per  trip in Australia. But some travel  markets are more lucrative, for instance  Chinese travellers spend around $9300  per trip.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ In contrast, domestic travellers spend  around $700 per trip.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The capacity for domestic travel revival  will be constrained by current travel  restrictions.

Bilateral travel corridors between countries, with non-quarantine  safeguards, could offer significant benefits

Page 5

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Safe travel corridors with selected countries are estimated to generate $20.5 billion for Australia  over a period of 12 months.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ When it is safe, and based on countries’ management of COVID-19, travel corridors could include  New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, China and Korea.

All parts of our aviation sector have been disrupted by COVID-19

Page 6

Australia’s domestic air travel has not  bounced back like many other countries that  have closed external borders.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ State border closures affecting aviation  services are costing about $69 million per  day.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ There has been widespread job losses  across the aviation sector, including  airlines, airports, catering and ground  handling and transport services.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australia’s two major carriers have laid

off around 11,500 employees.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The extent of direct job losses and  furloughed positions is already  affecting more than 34,000 people.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We need to plan now so we are ready to

ramp up air travel when health conditions  allow.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Any delay would unnecessarily impact the  aviation sector and heavily dependent

sectors, such as tourism and business  events.

The urgent need for a plan to restore Australia’s international aviation  links

Page 8

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Domestic tourism activity as Australians holiday at home rather than abroad will provide some  economic support.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It will not substitute for the lost activity in business, education and air freight which is a critical  component of our global air travel links.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We need to start planning for borders, first state and then international, to reopen once the health  situation permits.

Air travel is critical to the Australian economy. Travel corridors can be developed to rebuild the  $100 billion generated by international aviation at the same time as keeping Australians safe.

Travel corridors could be an effective means to open up travel within Australia and then with other select countries.

Rigorous public health measures to facilitate safe travel will be essential, including being prepared to halt travel again if the situation changes.

Strong coordination between tourism commissions, airlines and airports, industry associations and government  agencies will be essential to manage reopening.

Start slowly and build up in structured, incremental steps. It requires trust and the ability to contain the virus, including widespread testing, contact tracing and effective quarantining.
