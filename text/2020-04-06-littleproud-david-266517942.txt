Long term engagement bears fruit: first shipment of  persimmons to Thailand a success

Ã¯ÂÂ· First trial shipment of persimmons to Thailand has been successful.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Despite challenges due to drought and COVID-19, industry and governments  worked together to achieve this landmark.  Ã¯ÂÂ· The fruit sold out shortly after arrival, with positive consumer feedback.

The first trial shipment of Australian persimmons to Thailand has been a success with the fruit  selling out shortly after arrival.

Minister for Agriculture, David Littleproud, said the shipment showed the commitment to  expanding market access for Australian agricultural products, even during unprecedented and  challenging times.

“While our farmers and exporters face the challenges created by the drought and now COVID-19, they still managed to trial this new pathway to market,” Minister Littleproud said.

“The shipment marks a major milestone for Australian farmers made possible through ongoing  collaboration between industry, state and federal governments over close to seven years of  negotiations.

“This was the first shipment of any irradiated horticulture produce from Australia to Thailand.  Phytosanitary irradiation is a safe, fast and effective chemical free alternative to existing export  treatments.

“The persimmons arrived in Bangkok on 27 March. Reports are that the fruit sold out shortly  after going on sale, with consumers giving positive feedback on the fresh, nutritious and  delicious Australian produce.

“The Australian Government is committed to continuing to expand market access for  Australian produce internationally.

“Australia has negotiated this access into Thailand over a number of years demonstrating a  long-term commitment to the bilateral agricultural relationship.

“Thailand imports around $23 million of persimmons each year which provides a major new  market opportunity for Australian persimmon farmers.

“The Australian and Thai governments continue to work together towards opening the  irradiation pathway for other fruit exports, from Australia to Thailand and from Thailand to  Australia.”
