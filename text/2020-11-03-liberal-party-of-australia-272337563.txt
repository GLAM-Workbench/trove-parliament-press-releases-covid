Supporting Indigenous research

The Morrison Government is funding university research to improve the lives of Indigenous  Australians while providing leadership and training opportunities to Indigenous researchers.

Minister for Education Dan Tehan today announced $7.1 million for nine new research projects  through the Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Indigenous scheme.

This investment in research will complement the additional $1 billion for university research and  $157 million for research infrastructure announced in the 2020 Budget.

Funded projects include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $1.57 million to research native Australian plants for new applications in bush tucker,  novel foods, and ornamental plants for urban gardens. This research will lead to the  development of sustainable businesses owned by Indigenous communities (University  of Queensland).

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $454,044 to investigate and test how Indigenous cultural burning practices could help  manage the threat of bushfires in Australia (University of Melbourne).

“Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers will lead projects that investigate issues  impacting their people that lead to outcomes in the national interest,” Mr Tehan said.

“These research projects will aim to produce outcomes that provide economic, commercial,  environmental, social and cultural benefits.

“These research projects are part of our Government’s plan to invest in ideas and innovation to  help power Australia’s economic recovery from COVID-19.

“The Budget also provides $5.8 million to design a scheme to accelerate turning university  research into new products, job creation, productivity gains and economic growth.

“Our Government is investing in research that’s in the national interest and we have a plan to  turn that research into jobs, productivity gains and economic growth as part of our economic  recovery from COVID-19.”
