STATEMENT  TROPICAL CYCLONE YASA

Australia stands with the Government and people of Fiji, as they respond to the devastating  impacts of Tropical Cyclone (TC) Yasa, one of the strongest cyclones ever recorded in the  Pacific. Our thoughts and condolences are with our Fijian vuvale following the loss of lives,  damage to property and livelihoods.

The Australian Government will assist the Government of Fiji in whatever capacity we can.

Australian air force aircraft (P-8 Poseidon) will be deployed to assist with aerial surveillance of  storm affected areas.

The humanitarian and emergency relief supplies in Fiji that Australia replenished in the  aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Harold in April are helping to meet immediate needs. We stand  ready to deliver additional emergency supplies such as tents, tarpaulins and hygiene kits, and to  support the distribution of supplies to remote outer islands, which are reported to have been  severely hit by the category five storm.

Throughout our long history of cooperation, Fiji and Australia have become more than just  neighbours - we are family. Our partnership has been more important than ever as we faced  the challenges of 2020 together, from bushfires in Australia though COVID-19 and TC Harold.  Australia pledges our ongoing support to our Fijian vuvale following TC Yasa.
