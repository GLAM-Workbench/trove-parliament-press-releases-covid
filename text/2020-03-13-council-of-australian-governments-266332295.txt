MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS

Sydney - 13 March 2020

COMMUNIQUÃÂ

The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) held its 48th general meeting today in Sydney. The  discussion focussed on Australia’s response to coronavirus (also known as COVID-19) and on  recovery from the 2019-20 bushfires. Leaders also made progress on a range of existing COAG  priorities, directed at improving the current and future wellbeing of Australians.

Protecting Australians from the impact of coronavirus

Australia is experiencing the impacts of coronavirus, but we are one of the best-prepared countries  in the world, thanks to the early actions of all levels of government. Since January 2020, Australian  governments have been working together to develop, implement and coordinate strategies to slow  the spread of the virus, including through strengthening our world leading health system and  implementing border measures. Today, leaders committed to leveraging their combined resources  to slow the spread of the virus and ensure Australia stays ahead of the curve in minimising the  impact of coronavirus on the Australian community and economy.

With the wellbeing and safety of Australians being their highest priority, leaders will continue to  manage the risk of the virus based on the best and latest evidence and medical advice. The new  National Partnership Agreement on COVID-19 Response, signed by all leaders today, is a 50-50  shared funding deal between the Commonwealth and the states and territories that will ensure the  capacity of our health system to effectively assess, diagnose and treat people with coronavirus in a  way that minimises the spread of the virus in the community and protects our most vulnerable. As  part of the deal, the Commonwealth will deliver an immediate $100 million advance payment, on a  population basis, to the states and territories to prepare the health system.

Coronavirus has been declared a global pandemic and Australia is well prepared, including across  non-health sectors. On 25 February 2020, at the request of the Chief Medical Officer, the Australian  Government activated the Emergency Response Plan for Communicable Disease Incidents of  National Significance: National Arrangements (National CD Plan). The National CD Plan, developed  and endorsed by all jurisdictions in 2018, outlines how non-health sectors (such as police, childcare,  schools, transport and essential utilities) will support the health sector response. Today, leaders  welcomed the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee’s (AHPPC’s) development of a  risk-based decision-making tool for mass gatherings. They agreed to work in a co-ordinated way and  have regard to the advice of the AHPPC, should the need arise to adjust services in response to  coronavirus. All decisions will be proportionate to the risk.

COAG agreed to commission real-time, transparent protocols, underpinned by advice from the  AHPPC and working through the National Coordination Mechanism, to support a consistent  approach to containment and preparedness for coronavirus. These protocols will include  management of mass gatherings, school closures, health management in remote communities and  public transport, with decisions on applying the protocols resting with states and territories. COAG  further agreed that the AHPPC advice will have the status of COAG advice, and to implement and  follow the advice, as necessary.

While coronavirus is first and foremost a health crisis, it is having significant economic impacts.  Australia’s strong economy means we are well-positioned to respond to the economic impacts of the  virus. Our economy has demonstrated its resilience during past shocks and we are in our

29th consecutive year of economic growth. All Australian governments will play their part in  delivering complementary, targeted and proportionate responses to the economic impacts of  coronavirus. Leaders noted presentations from the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the Secretary  of the Australian Treasury, and accepted advice that current fiscal settings in jurisdictions should be  adjusted to mitigate the economic impact on Australians and best position the nation for recovery.

Healing and rebuilding from the 2019-20 bushfires

The scale of the destruction and disruption caused by the 2019-20 bushfires is unprecedented in  Australian history. Leaders expressed their deepest sympathies for the lives, homes, businesses and  wildlife lost as a result of the fires, as well as the impacts on Aboriginal culture. They paid tribute to  those who served our country over the summer, especially our fire and emergency services, defence  forces and the thousands of volunteers who supported relief and recovery efforts. Leaders also  acknowledged the generous donations and offers of support from across the nation and all over the  world.

With the fires now under control, leaders discussed the next phase of the recovery effort - a  long-term, national approach to support communities heal and rebuild, while at the same time  continuing to meet the immediate needs of those affected by the fires. Leaders agreed to implement  a National Bushfire Recovery Plan spanning social, built, natural and economic recovery, and  including local economic recovery plans for the most-impacted regions. This Plan builds on existing  initiatives, including support to small businesses and primary producers, which is being rolled out in  fire-affected areas.

Following the experience of this national-scale disaster, leaders agreed to review and if necessary  update how governments apply the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements. The review will look  to streamline processes where possible, and provide for building back better and the restoration of  environmental amenity. Australians impacted by the same disaster in the same way should have  equitable access to recovery assistance, irrespective of what side of the border they are on, and be  treated consistently and fairly.

Leaders acknowledged the changing global climate carries risks for Australia. Leaders were  presented with a preliminary report prepared by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial  Research Organisation on climate and disaster resilience. They will consider the final report and  review the investments that governments make in disaster resilience at the next meeting.

Today, leaders agreed that building resilience to natural disasters requires coordinated action from  all governments, together with the private sector and communities. They formalised this agreement  by endorsing the National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework and by asking Emergency  Management Ministers to develop a National Action Plan to implement the framework in  consultation with other COAG councils and forums. A new $261 million Commonwealth-State  partnership agreement will fund implementation of risk reduction initiatives in-line with the  framework.

Leaders also agreed to take immediate action across three streams of risk reduction work: improving  the resilience of the national telecommunications network; asking the Building Ministers’ Forum to  consider how to adapt the built environment to future climate and hazard conditions; and asking the  Australian Data and Digital Council, in consultation with the Ministerial Council for Police and  Emergency Management to improve national natural hazard data and intelligence to enable the  development of new information products such as a national fire map.

Responding to the unprecedented drought

Extreme drought conditions are the most unrelenting effect of a changing climate in Australia.  Despite recent rain, the Bureau of Meteorology advises that warmer than average conditions are  likely until at least June 2020. Leaders acknowledged the Agriculture Ministers’ Forum Drought  Working Group and noted progress to date on actions to support drought-affected farmers and  regional communities. They look forward to receiving detailed advice from Agriculture Ministers  later in 2020.

Reducing violence against women and their children

Australian women and children have the right to live in safety and be free from violence. The  murders of Hannah Clarke and her three children shocked the country and reinforced once again the  prevalence of violence against women and their children. On average, one woman a week is killed by  a current or former intimate partner.

Reducing this violence is everyone’s responsibility. Reflecting their commitment to implement, and  where possible, expedite their contributions under the Fourth Action Plan, leaders agreed to elevate  Women’s Safety Ministers’ meetings to a new COAG Council to drive implementation of initiatives  under the Fourth Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their  Children 2010-2022 (www.plan4womenssafety.gov.au). Leaders agreed that national primary  prevention campaigns and activities play an important role in changing the attitudes and behaviours  that can lead to violence against women. As a priority, the COAG Women’s Safety Council will work  together to understand the current status of crisis accommodation and how to improve the  effectiveness of current housing support. Leaders agreed that Women’s Safety Ministers will start  work on the development of the next National Plan, with national consultations to begin in Alice  Springs in 2020.

Taking responsibility for our waste

Recognising that our waste is our responsibility, leaders agreed to introduce a ban on the export of  waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres, fulfilling the commitment they made in August 2019. The ban  will be phased in, commencing from 1 July 2020. Leaders also agreed a national response strategy to  drive implementation of the ban and help reduce the amount of waste ending up in landfill. In line  with the response strategy, governments will expand on work with industry to invest in growing the  Australian recycling industry and build markets for recycled products.

Recognising particular waste and recycling challenges in remote and regional areas such as northern  Australia, leaders agreed to ask the Ministerial Forum on Northern Development to ensure measures  to support the waste export ban are coordinated across, and meet the collective needs of, northern  Australian jurisdictions.

Understanding and preventing suicide

Reducing lives lost to suicide is a priority for all governments. Sadly, some groups are particularly at  risk of suicide. One of those groups is veterans of the Australian Defence Force (ADF), and concerted  action is needed to ensure everything possible is being done to stop these individuals taking their  own lives. Leaders agreed to support the establishment of a new National Commissioner for Defence  and Veteran Suicide Prevention to inquire into all suspected veteran and ADF suicides. Leaders asked  the COAG Council of Attorneys-General to finalise arrangements, in consultation with chief coroners.

Leaders also agreed to enhance current suicide prevention initiatives for all Australians by expanding  and sharing de-identified data collected on suicide and self-harm, exploring options to improve

access to person-centred aftercare services, and integrating suicide prevention services with  non-health systems.

Acknowledging the higher rate of suicide among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, COAG  committed to working with Gayaa Dhuwi (Proud Spirit) Australia and relevant Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander Community Controlled Organisations to develop culturally appropriate aftercare  models.

Leaders will discuss suicide prevention and broader mental health reform again at the next meeting  of COAG.

Building a workforce for the future

Leaders noted an update on the COAG Skills Council’s progress to reform the Vocational Education  and Training (VET) sector to support millions of Australians obtain the skills needed to prosper in the  modern economy. Leaders agreed three reform priorities for the sector: relevance, quality and  accessibility. COAG noted the National Skills Commission will undertake research and analysis of  future skills needs across industry to better align government funding with labour market demands.

Delivering infrastructure for Australia’s future population

Leaders considered analysis on the market’s capacity to deliver Australia’s record pipeline of  infrastructure investment to support the country’s growing population. This analysis highlighted the  importance of monitoring infrastructure market conditions and capacity at regular intervals to  inform government policies and project pipeline development. Leaders agreed that Infrastructure  Australia will work with jurisdictions and relevant industry peak bodies to monitor this sector.

Understanding how Australia’s population is changing and the implications of these changes is  critical to delivering the infrastructure needed for the future. Leaders agreed to a new National  Population and Planning Framework and look forward to working collaboratively to understand and  manage the effects of population change across Australia.

Reciprocal arrangements between states and territories for innovative customer focussed  initiatives

Leaders noted the successful rollout of state-led technological innovations improving services for  citizens (for example, digital driver licences) and supported these innovations being considered by all  jurisdictions in a timely way.
