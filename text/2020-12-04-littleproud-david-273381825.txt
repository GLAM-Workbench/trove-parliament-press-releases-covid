WINNERS OF THE 2020 RESILIENT AUSTRALIA AWARDS



Minister for Emergency Management David Littleproud has today congratulated the  winners of the 2020 Resilient Australia Awards at a ceremony at the National Museum of  Australia, Canberra.

The awards celebrate individuals, organisations, councils, and schools in our communities  who show initiative in helping to create a more disaster resilient Australia.

“Despite navigating COVID-19, the response this year was outstanding with 173 entries  received across six categories,” Minister Littleproud said.

“Thuringowa State High School’s virtual platform was impressive in helping students  understand disaster resilience in a changing climate.

“While the Queensland Centre for Perinatal and Infant Mental Health took out the National  Award for ‘Birdie’s Tree’, a series of online games and stories aimed at helping young  children cope with the anguish of natural disasters and COVID-19.

“By celebrating innovation and best practice, these awards showcase work that is often  unrecognised, inspiring others to think about how they can be more disaster resilient.



The Resilient Australia Awards are managed by the Australian Institute for Disaster and  sponsored by the Department of Home Affairs in conjunction with the states and territories.
