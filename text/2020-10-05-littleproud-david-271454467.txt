More funding to help Queensland communities  recover from bushfires  Five Queensland council areas heavily impacted by last year’s bushfires will share in more than $6  million to deliver a range of locally developed projects that will contribute to economic and social  recovery, and create local jobs.

Minister for Emergency Management David Littleproud said the projects were being supported  through the $36.8 million Local Economic Recovery (LER) program for Queensland, which is jointly  funded by the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments under the Disaster Recovery  Funding Arrangements.

“The Queensland Bushfires in 2019 had a devastating effect on communities throughout  Queensland,” Minister Littleproud said.

“The recovery from these fires was made that much harder by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has  impacted all sectors, including tourism and agriculture, as well as small businesses who were  already struggling through drought.

“The Commonwealth and Queensland Governments remain committed to helping communities  recover following natural disaster, and these projects will produce enduring benefits and improve  future resilience.

“The six projects announced today benefit from the first round of funding under the program, with  more than $30 million in future investment still to come.”

Queensland Treasurer and Minister responsible for the Queensland Reconstruction Authority  (QRA) Cameron Dick said the funds would prove a welcome boost to local communities at a time  of significant challenge.

“We know Queensland communities are doing it tough at the moment with the COVID pandemic  still wreaking havoc around the world,” Mr Dick said.

“However, because we’ve managed the health response in our state we can progress projects like  these that create jobs and infrastructure for Queenslanders.

“The projects announced today vary greatly, from initiatives to boost local water supply and  construct walking trails to cinema upgrades.
