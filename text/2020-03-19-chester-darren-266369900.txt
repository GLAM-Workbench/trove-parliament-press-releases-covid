2020 PRIME MINISTER’S VETERANS’ EMPLOYMENT AWARDS  CEREMONY CANCELLED

FOLLOWING recommendations by health authorities, the 2020 Prime Minister’s Veterans’  Employment Awards ceremony on Tuesday, 24 March at Parliament House, has been cancelled.

Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel Darren Chester said while the  cancellation of the event is disappointing, it is a responsible and sensible precaution to help  safeguard guests and staff.

“We are doing all we can to protect the health, well-being and livelihoods of Australians in response  to Coronavirus and I know the finalists and guests invited will understand that it was necessary to  cancel this year’s ceremony,” Mr Chester said.

“The Awards are an opportunity to recognise and celebrate the valuable skills of our veterans, and  the organisations that support them, and while the ceremony will not take place as planned I  congratulate all the finalists for their exceptional leadership in employing veterans and highlighting  the valuable skills ADF personnel bring to the workforce.”

Precautionary changes had been made to the operations of Parliament House, as well as the  National Cabinet accepting the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee advice that non-essential indoor gatherings of greater than 100 people (including staff) will no longer be permitted  from Wednesday, 18 March 2020.

“We are looking at alternatives to ensure finalists and winners are appropriately recognised for their  work in supporting veteran employment and I would like to acknowledge the commitment to  veteran employment by our corporate supporters of the Prime Minister’s Veterans’ Employment  Awards — particularly our Gold Sponsors, Westpac and ECLIPS,” Mr Chester said.

An announcement of the 2020 Winners will be made next week.
