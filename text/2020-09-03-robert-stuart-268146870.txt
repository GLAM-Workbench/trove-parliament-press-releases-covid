Update on NDIS participants and COVID-19

Below is the daily update on NDIS participants and workforce and COVID-19 for Thursday,  3 September 2020.

The reporting will ensure accurate and timely information is being provided to the community. The data is  collated through reporting mechanisms of the NDIS Quality and Safeguard Commission and compiled by  the Commonwealth’s NDIS Critical Response Group.



Monitoring the situation in NDIS residential services is an ongoing priority for the Australian Government.  In August, the NDIA created a panel of four large experienced disability providers to offer additional  workforce support for participants living in residential settings. These providers are able to offer advice,  support staff and isolation accommodation for smaller organisations to access as needed due to the impact of  COVID-19.



In early August, the NDIA reached out to 136 NDIS registered Victorian SIL providers to ensure they were  prepared and aware of the support available, including the assistance from the panel of large providers.  These connections have been welcomed and helped ensure all providers continue to deliver for NDIS  participants.

Notes:   - Data only includes cases of COVID-19 in NDIS funded supports and services notified to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission by registered  NDIS providers.

Infections may not occur due to the provision of NDIS supports and services and include acquired infections in the community.    - Data does not include: reports of people with disability who manage their own supports in the NDIS, as they are not required to report; all NDIS
