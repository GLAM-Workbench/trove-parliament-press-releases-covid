COMMONWEALTH BANK EXTENDS LEAVE TO PARENTS OF STILLBORN

CHILDREN



Labor welcomes the Commonwealth Bankâ€™s announcement that employees who experience stillbirth  will now be provided the same paid parental leave as other parents - along with access to other  support services.

The Commonwealth Bank is the latest company to afford these important provisions with primary  carers able to access 12 weeks of paid parental leave and secondary carers able to access four  weeks paid leave.

They join NAB, Bendigo Bank, Australia Post, PWC, Bunnings, ANU and other private companies  who have extended such arrangements to mothers and fathers who experience the tragic loss of a  child through stillbirth.

Whilst there has been some progress, too many private companies are yet to make these changes.

The bipartisan Senate Stillbirth Inquiry recommended changes to both the Fair Work Act and the  National Employment Standards to provide consistency across all employers and employees in  Australia. Labor looks forward to the Government making these amendments.

We must remember that paid parental leave is exactly that - parental leave - and parents who give  birth to stillborn babies are still parents.

Mothers give birth, they have to recover physically; parents have to recover emotionally and they  have to parent their stillborn baby which can include things like autopsies, funerals and counselling.

Stillbirth is the biggest cause of infant death in our country today and the rate of death from stillbirth  is higher than the national road toll.

It is also a solitary grief that has been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and the necessary  social distancing restrictions.

We must be doing everything we can to support Australian families mourning their stillborn babies  during this pandemic and beyond.
