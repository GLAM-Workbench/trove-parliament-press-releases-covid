VERITY GORMAN

Tell me about, like, what are your current thoughts at the moment? We’ve got an inquiry happening  into workplace culture at Parliament House. What do you think it’s going to uncover?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, hopefully what it does do is engender more respect. And that’s what it is all about at the end  of the day. It’s about having respect for one another, respect for people’s private space, respect for  people being in that workplace where we’ve got a big job to do. We’re running the nation after all.  And when people elect representatives and when those representatives employ staff, they should all  have that respect very much embedded in everything that they do for and on behalf of communities,  for and on behalf of the nation.

VERITY GORMAN

What are you sort of - in your own experience, have the stories that have come out to do with the  workplace culture surprised you? It’s been your workplace for quite some time.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, it’s disappointing. And look, I’ve always just got along and got my job done. Went there  worked long hours in the Parliament, of course and in and around the electorate but reading about  these stories and hearing from others about what may or may not have gone on in the past, it is  disappointing. And you know there’s been a lot of allegations and certainly know that it’s important  that those allegations be aired to the proper authorities - that is the police. If a criminal assault has  taken place or a sexual assault has taken place, then those are matters which the police need to hear





about, the police need to investigate. And that’s where those matters should go to - always. It is  very, very difficult, though, of course, when a staff member says to a Member of Parliament that  they don’t want anything said. I’m not sure whether those allegations that have been made or told  in the full light as to the gravity of what went on or what was alleged to have gone on, so the  Minister made a call on what she was told, made a call on the fact that the staff member at the time  apparently told her that she didn’t want to go any further and then has changed her mind later on.

Now, that of course, is entirely a matter for the staff member and the Minister. The Minister has  subsequently taken leave, of course. The allegations have now been directed to the Australian  Federal Police. And in the case of the other matter, those matters involving Christian Porter and his  debating teammate back when they were teenagers, it was referred to the New South Wales police  who looked at them and then she actually asked that they be no longer looked at, they be no longer  investigated. Of course, very, very sadly, very, very tragically she took her own life the next day.

So, I appreciate these are very, very difficult matters for the people involved - all the people  involved. Very difficult matters too for the Police but certainly for the families of those involved, and  the right way to do this is through the right channels of our judiciary, the right channels of our  policing. And we have a rule of law. We need to follow it. We need to follow the proper processes  and protocols and that’s what will be done.

VERITY GORMAN

With the current discourse around sort of what the culture is like at Parliament House, has had  made you reflect back on what it has been like and think about it differently?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, not for me, because I’ve always run a pretty tight ship. My staff members know that there’s  respect in our office. My staff members have always known that if they need to take time off for  family matters or personal matters that has always come first for me as their employer and certainly  my door has always been open if they ever wanted to discuss matters that were important to them,  matters that they were concerned about. And I’ve always made that quite clear.

And of course, in recent weeks I called my staff together and I told them that I wanted respect in my  workplace to continue. I wanted to have a very happy, safe and friendly workplace and I wanted  them to go home and tell not only their partners but also their parents that that’s what I had told  them. I know that my employees have always been happy in the workplace. I know they’ve always  worked hard for and on behalf of the constituents of the Riverina and in the ministerial portfolios  I’ve held.

VERITY GORMAN

But they don’t just work in your office and you don’t just work in your office, it’s a bigger workplace  than that. So are you saying that you haven’t witnessed it within that bigger setting or thought about  any of the goings on within your Party and Parliament House itself?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well look, there’s six and a half thousand people who work in Parliament House and of course  there’s always rumours in corridors, there’s always things that are said. But any matter that has ever





come to my attention about anything that people have raised concerns about I’ve always directed  them to the right places. I’ve never heard anybody come to me with a matter that was serious  enough to go to the Police. But, indeed, any matters that they were concerned about, there are  processes in place and I’ve always directed people to the right places.

VERITY GORMAN

What changes do you think need to come from this time? Do you think, you know, there is a big,  broad discussion happening. There’s an inquiry into what workplace culture should be like. What  would you like to see come from this?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

More respect. More respect and not just in the Parliament but right throughout the country. We  need to be able to respect one another. We need to be able to respect people for the job that  they’re doing, whether it’s in the Parliament, whether it’s in an office situation elsewhere around  the nation. We need to have respect for people, and I’d like to see that that respect be more  prevalent throughout society.

VERITY GORMAN

What are you hearing from constituents? Have they been writing to you? I’ve heard other federal  MPs say they’ve been receiving lots of correspondence from constituents concerned about the  culture in Parliament House. What have you been hearing out on the streets from the people who  are within your electorate?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, we’ve received a few letters and I’ll be writing back to those. I’ve already written back to some  of the people who’ve already raised their concerns. But look, I have to say, most people are more  concerned about the vaccine roll-out. Most people are more concerned about their jobs. Most  people are more concerned about the issues of the day than what is actually happening with this  situation that you’ve just spoken about.

Now, I appreciate it’s a very big issue. I appreciate that I’ve addressed my staff and at all times I’ve  always exercised very much respect in my workplace. I’ve made sure that I’ve had the respect for my  colleagues, my employees, and they’ve done the same with me and with their peers.

VERITY GORMAN

Do you not think of this as the biggest issue of the day? Because this is the party who is in charge of  the country. This stuff sort of filters down right to the micro-level and it’s setting the tone from the  top?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, it’s an important issue, but there are a lot of important issues going on. I think people sitting  around their kitchen table working out their household budget, that’s important, too. People  wondering if the current situation with COVID and jobs, that’s important too. And I know people are  concerned about what may be going on in the Parliament. It is, after all, the house of democracy.





They want to make sure that the people they send to Canberra and those people who work for them  are doing the right thing, they’re working hard for and on their behalf. And that’s what I do every  day of the week. I make sure that I work hard for and on behalf of the people of the Riverina first  and foremost and of course, in my wider portfolio responsibilities make sure that I’m always doing  everything that I should be.

Now, I can’t control the actions of others - other colleagues or, indeed, other employees in other  offices. I can only control what I do as myself and what I do with my employees as far as having a  respectful workplace. That comes down to those people, whether they’re elected representatives or  whether they’re indeed employees of those elected representatives, to take responsibility for their  own actions. It does come down to people taking responsibility for their own actions and making  sure that at all times they can look their constituents in the eye, that they can look each other in the  eye and say, “I did the right thing at all times.”

VERITY GORMAN

Is Christian Porter going to be able to come back into his role and the Government get on with  governing? Is it going to be as simple as that?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, I’d like to think so. Christian has dedicated his life to helping others and to making sure that in  his previous role in law and his previous role with the Western Australian Government and his  current role as Attorney-General, he has very much done what he needed to do as far as respecting  the rule of law and making sure that the laws are obeyed. Indeed, he’s contributed mightily to the  Parliament, both at the Western Australian level and at the national level. I’m sure he’ll be able to  have his time off. It’s a difficult time for him, of course, and we need to give him that space, give him  that breathing space. We need to allow him to come back and do the role that he’s been doing in a  fine way as Attorney-General and indeed, as the Minister for Industrial Relations for our nation.

VERITY GORMAN

Former Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, has confirmed he’ll stand for preselection as a  National Senate candidate. What are your thoughts on that?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

I’m pleased that, you know, somebody of his experience and somebody of his values, somebody  who understands what regional Australians need, want and expect, deserve, has decided to put up  his hand and offer himself for public life again. John was a fine Deputy Prime Minister. He was a fine  Member for Gwydir. He knows what it’s like to be a local member. He knows what it’s like to be  second in charge of the nation, the running of the nation. And he knows what it’s like to fight for and  on behalf of regional people.

Regional people at the moment need every fighter in their corner. They’ve certainly got with the  Nationals. The Nationals, as you see here today at this Ardlethan and Beyond Museum opening with  Steph Cooke and myself coming together to make sure that they’ve got the right funding to open a  magnificent new museum. And that’s the sort of thing that Nationals in government do. I think  John’s got a lot to contribute. I welcome his preselection candidacy.





But, then again, it is up to those central councillors, it is up to the National Party whether or not they  take that candidacy and give him the preselection nomination so that then he can actually put his  name on the ballot paper for the Senate at the next election. So that’s very much the democratic  way we do things. It’s not just a walk-up start. You don’t just put your hand up and take that  position. It will be up to the members of the Nationals to determine whether, in fact, he does get  that preselection. And then it will be up to the voters of Australia, the voters of New South Wales, as  to whether he goes forward.

VERITY GORMAN

He said he wouldn’t undermine your leadership. Is that reassuring?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Absolutely. John and I, we get on very, very well. Just like I do with other former Deputy Prime  Ministers. I’ve sought his counsel right from the outset from 2018 when I became Deputy Prime  Minister. He was one of the first people I spoke to. I’ve always had the highest regard, the highest  respect for John and his wife, Julia. They’ve been mighty contributors for northern New South  Wales, for New South Wales, for regional Australia. They’ve done a great job. And I’m sure that if he  gets preselected and then ultimately wins that Senate spot - it’s very winnable, the number 2 spot  on the senate ticket for the coalition at the next election, it’s a very winnable spot - I’m sure that if  he goes all the way and gets elected to the Senate of Australia he’ll do a great job for and on behalf  of regional Australians.

VERITY GORMAN

Given the current sort of discourse and the concern about culture and women in parliament, would  you like to see a female on that ticket preselected?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, again, it’s up to the National Party preselectors as to whom they put forward. At the moment  John is the only one as I know. There’s been a lot of speculation as to who might or might not put  their hand up for preselection, but John’s the only one who’s actually put his hand up. If a good and  viable female candidate from within the ranks of the National Party decides to put her name up,  then good on her, too. It will be up to the preselectors as to whom they decide.

VERITY GORMAN

And, lastly, Harry and Meghan. There’s been a lot, obviously, and very serious - you know, they’re  serious allegations against Buckingham Palace. Is it time for us to become a republic?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

I’ve got more to worry about than what the goings on are in the Royal Family.

VERITY GORMAN

But we’re part of the Commonwealth.





MICHAEL McCORMACK

Yes, sure we are. But, you know, I’m worried about people’s jobs. I’m wanting to make sure that  they have a future. I’m wanting to make sure that they meet their household bills. There’s a lot going  on in Parliament at the moment. That’s the things that are occupying my mind other than what the  Royals may or may not be doing. Whilst it might be grist for it media mill, I appreciate that the Royal  Family is a great institution, but I’m worried about regional Australians at the moment. I’m focused  on their interests. I’m focused on making sure there are jobs for the future. I’m focused on making  sure that we continue to lower taxes for business. I’m focused on making sure that we get all the  economic parameters right because we’ve got a big job to do as we build out the back of COVID.

The COVID situation, of course, has hit our economy hard. We’re building back better. We’re getting  the vaccine rolled out. Delighted that Mark Coulton’s been able to get so many regional centres with  those vaccines so that all regional Australians, indeed all Australians can get that jab. It’s going to be  so important. By the end of October I hope every Australian has the jab. We can get aviation back up  and flying again, because planes in the air means jobs on it ground. That’s pretty critical for me at  the moment. Tourism, I’ll be having a bit more to say about that very soon. Very, very important that  we get our aviation sector back to some sort of pre-COVID normality and very focused on regional  Australia.

VERITY GORMAN

Where do you sit on the republic debate, though? Because it will come up in the future and Australia  will have to make that decision or at least, you know, there’ll be a discussion about it. What are your  thoughts? Do you think we should be a republic after the Queen dies?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

I’ve got more important things to worry about at the moment than what day Australia Day should  be -

VERITY GORMAN

But you must have an opinion?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well look, like I say, I’m focused on the things that really matter to most Australians. At the moment  the republic is not the barbeque stopper that some in the media might like to think it is. At the  moment I’m focused on making sure that regional Australians have jobs and making sure that those  54,000 jobs that are in regional Australia which aren’t being filled, that we get the word out there to  metropolitan Australia there are jobs out here in regional Australia. There are great communities. I  mean, have a look. I’m in Ariah Street, Ardlethan. You wouldn’t get a better community. There’s  plenty of jobs out here. Plenty of jobs in Wagga Wagga that are just at the moment going begging  because they won’t be filled and can’t be filled by Australians. So that’s my focus at the moment, not  on the republic, not on what day Australia Day should be. I know there are people who’d like to  change the flag, too. All those sorts of things. Yes, we can have those discussions. We can have them





in the future. Quite frankly, I’m happy with the constitutional monarchy we have at the moment.  Quite happy with the flag. Quite happy with the Australia Day being on January 26.

But what I would say is I do hope that we actually are able to commemorate ANZAC Day in the way  we should. And I know we’ve had a lot of protests and parades. We’ve had a lot of people there and  that’s all well and good. But what I would like to see is us to be able to have an ANZAC Day as we’ve  had it pre-COVID. I don’t want to have to see - whilst it was great last year where so many  Australians went to the edge of their driveways or edge of their sort of streets with a candle or a  torch, that was good because we were very much in COVID lockdown and that was important that  we exercise social distancing and that we weren’t able to mass together in big parades on April 25.  But this year, all things being equal, we are able to have other parades and people are able to  protest in mass numbers, we should be able to have ANZAC Day the way we always used to know  and respect.

And I think that’s going to be very important, because it is an important ANZAC Day this year. We’re  celebrating 100 years of the Royal Australian Air Force. That’s important. We’re celebrating other  milestones, too. So many Australians provided so much service and sacrifice and they should be  honoured on April 25 more than just going down to the edge of driveways and holding a torch; a  torch which was a beacon for ANZAC, the spirit of ANZAC, but I think this year it’s going to be  important with all the is health orders in place that people are able to gather in mass numbers  around cenotaphs, lay wreaths and do what they need to be able to do to honour the service and  sacrifice of so many men and women who have gone before us.

VERITY GORMAN

Do you think we’ll be able to?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

I hope so. I sincerely hope so. And certainly in our country centres, if it’s good enough to play sport,  if it’s good enough to have other events in numbers, then it should be good enough to have ANZAC  Day. And I’d really, really like the RSL to help make that call. And it would be very important for the  health authorities also to give it a tick off in good enough time so that the various sub-branches  around the region can prepare.

VERITY GORMAN

Anything further to add?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Look, I am really delighted to be here with John Seymour, the Coolamon Mayor. Does a great job. I  know we’ve spent so much money with Local Roads and Community Infrastructure, the Drought  Communities Programme Extension and others which we’ve helped build. So there’s this $426,000  wonderful monument and keeping place and museum to Ardlethan’s history. It’s a great history.  Ardlethan, so many great families that contributed so mightily to the wealth and the prosperity of  the Riverina. They want to be able to remember their past, but they also want to build for the  future. And that’s what they’re doing with this museum.





I know so many people in Ardlethan have made sure and have fundraised so much money to be able  to get this facility up and running. And I think people should not only visit it but come and have a  look at the Frank Bradley statue as well, former Stawell Gift winner. So much to see and do in  Coolamon Shire, so much to see in Ardlethan. Thank you so much.
