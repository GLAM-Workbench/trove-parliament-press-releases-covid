INLAND RAIL CONTRACTS TURNOUT BIG FOR AUSSIE MADE

Regional Victoria will reap ongoing benefits after the Australian Rail Track Corporation signed an  $80 million contract for the local manufacture of Inland Rail turnouts by Vossloh Cogifer’s Australian  facilities.

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development Michael  McCormack said this was further evidence of the significant economic benefits the 1,700 kilometre  Inland Rail connecting Melbourne to Brisbane.

“The Australian Government’s investment in Inland Rail is delivering a world-class freight backbone  that will stimulate economic growth, build supply chain resilience and enhance market access,” the  Deputy Prime Minister said.

“But local industries and suppliers will benefit right now as shown by the signing of this major  contract.

“Over the next five years, Vossloh will need 32 additional people to support the design and  manufacture of more than 200 turnouts primarily in Castlemaine in central Victoria.

“It is but one example of the opportunities for manufacturers in Australia to supply a number of  products for Inland Rail, providing much needed employment that will grow and sustain business.  And it is providing the confidence to hire more staff.

“The unprecedented economic shock from COVID-19 is something that has affected us all. As we  recover, Australia needs people in jobs with our industries open and ready for business.”

Finance Minister Simon Birmingham said the Government’s investment in Inland Rail would continue  to deliver significant opportunities for Australian businesses and create more jobs for Australians.



“Inland Rail continues to drive economic activity throughout the construction phase and the local  manufacture of this critical part of rail infrastructure reinforces the positive flow-on effects of this  project right through our economy,” Minister Birmingham said.

“Inland Rail is backing businesses and jobs for Australians including across regional Victoria at a time  when we need them most.”

Minister for Regional Health, Regional Communications and Local Government Mark Coulton praised  the use of manufacturers in Australia to supply Inland Rail.

“Manufacturers from all over the country are supplying Inland Rail as we complete the 1,700 km  backbone of our national freight network,” Minister Coulton said.

“Construction of Inland Rail is delivering significant benefits to businesses and people in regional  Australia - but Inland Rail will deliver much more, it will deliver the long-term boost that regional  Australia deserves.”

Liberal Senator for Victoria Sarah Henderson welcomed the news a Castlemaine-based company had  won such a significant contract.

“This is just wonderful news for Castlemaine and the Bendigo electorate. This contract is delivering a  substantial 32 jobs for the 200 new turnouts Vossloh will be manufacturing,” Senator Henderson  said.

“This $80 million turnout contract for the component that allows a train to diverge from one track to  another guarantees jobs for Australians and provides stimulus for local manufacturers.

”This represents a very big boost for regional Victoria.”

Chief Executive Officer of Vossloh AG Oliver Schuster welcomed the opportunity to be involved in  the delivery of Inland Rail.

“This order is the biggest in the history of Vossloh in Australia. It highlights our strong market  position and the increasing importance of the Australian market,” he said.

“We are delighted that our long-standing customer ARTC has once again placed its trust in us and  that we can contribute to the biggest rail infrastructure project for freight transport in Australia.

“Vossloh is a highly experienced manufacturer in Australia, supplying turnouts, special trackwork  components and concrete sleepers to the major rail operators in Australia.

“We have provided our products for some of the nation’s largest infrastructure projects across  Australia, and we’re looking forward to getting started on Inland Rail.”

To date, millions of dollars’ worth of contracts have been awarded to Australian manufacturers  supplying Inland Rail, including:

Ã¯ÂÂ· $51 million in steel rail (38,000 tonnes) supplied by Liberty OneSteel Whyalla, South  Australia.  Ã¯ÂÂ· $25 million in ballast and capping (800,000 tonnes) from Parkes-based companies Calvani  Crushing and Ausrock Quarries.
