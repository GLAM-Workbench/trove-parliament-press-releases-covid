Australia celebrates our farmers on National Agriculture Day

Ã¯ÂÂ· National Agriculture Day is celebrated today, Friday 20 November 2020.  Ã¯ÂÂ· The Australian Government remains committed to advancing agriculture in this  country and reinforcing its significance on the world stage.  Ã¯ÂÂ· The Ag2030 plan sets out the Government’s current actions to support the agricultural

sector’s ambitious goal of growing to a $100 billion industry by 2030.

National Agriculture Day is a chance for all Australians to celebrate our farmers and thank them for  ensuring safe, fresh, and reliable supplies of food.

In acknowledging the National Farmers Federation’s initiatives for National Agriculture Day,  Minister for Agriculture, David Littleproud said the future for agriculture was looking up.

“It has been a tough year for all Australians, with drought, bushfire, and a pandemic,” Minister  Littleproud said.

“Our agricultural industries and communities have again shown their strength and flexibility in both  responding to these emerging challenges and taking advantage of new opportunities.

“We’re putting our shoulder to the wheel with the agricultural sector to reach its goal of a $100  billion industry by 2030.

“We are delivering our Ag2030 plan, driving job creation and economic growth, while supporting  recovery from drought, bushfires, and impacts of COVID-19.

“Australia is among the top 15 agricultural exporters in the world, exporting about 70 per cent of  production to 192 countries, and we remain committed to expanding these opportunities.

“At the heart of our agricultural industries and communities are the people who make it all happen.  I thank our rural and regional Australian’s who are the backbone of our vibrant agriculture sector.

“Today is about looking to the bright future ahead for our farmers and great regional communities.
