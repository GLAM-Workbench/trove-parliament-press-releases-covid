YOUNG PEOPLE FACING LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF COVID

RECESSION



Younger Australians have been facing a poor labour market and struggling to

get their careers underway, a new report released today has highlighted.



A Productivity Commission report released today highlights some of the long

term, systemic issues facing young Australians entering the job market after

study.



The report found that following the Global Financial Crisis in

2008, many graduates of tertiary and vocational education could only find lower

paid and lower skilled jobs, and experienced nearly zero wage growth.



This has led to long-term negative implications on the lifetime earnings, job

satisfaction and career prospects of those young workers.





The chances of young Australians getting work at all also fell and many were

pushed off the career ladder entirely.



Unfortunately, the COVID recession could lead to even worse outcomes for

young people, who are the biggest causalities of the current unemployment

crisis.



Young people are facing many challenges - including soaring unemployment,

stalled prospects, depleted retirement savings, and interruptions in education

and training.



Years of persistently high youth unemployment figures have lingered under the

Liberal Government.



If Scott Morrison does not develop a plan to support our young people through

the COVID recession and in the recovery, there could be devastating long term

consequences.



The Morrison Government must ensure the needs of young people are front of

mind every step of the way as we navigate this recession.
