Generous Aussies gave life and sight in 2020

A 2020 report on organ and tissue donation and transplantation shows that despite the significant  impact of COVID-19, around 4,000 Australians benefitted from the gift of organ, eye, and tissue  donation from a deceased donor.

The Minister responsible for the Organ and Tissue Authority, Mark Coulton, said the 2020  Australian Donation and Transplantation Activity Report confirms Australian generosity and  willingness to give complete strangers a second chance through organ and tissue donation.

“This report shows that even when the chips are down and a global pandemic interrupts the  national transplant program, Australian generosity shines through.

“Last year, despite the pandemic, some 1,644 Australians’ death provided the gift of life and sight  to another Australian,” Minister Coulton said.

“We are very grateful to these Australians and their families for making organ, eye, and tissue  donations possible.”

The report, released today, shows 1,270 Australian lives were saved through an organ transplant  in 2020, due to the generosity of 463 deceased organ donors and their families. The report also  shows 2,277 Australians received corneal transplants in 2020 from 1,318 donors.

“A corneal transplant can make a remarkable difference to someone’s quality of life.

“More than 23,500 Australians have thankfully received the gift of sight since the national  program began in 2009,” Minister Coulton said.

Minister Coulton said it is important to also recognise the great power of tissue donation.

“Whether they gave heart valves to repair genetic defects in young children or skin grafts to help  treat infection and trauma, the 290 deceased tissue donors in 2020 made a great difference to  many lives.

“Last year, 182 living donors improved the lives of another Australian; predominantly by donating  kidneys and in one case, a partial liver.

"Living donors make an incredibly generous sacrifice to improve the life of someone else.

“Organ transplants are not without risk to those who donate, and their act of kindness mustn’t be  understated,” Minister Coulton said.

Last year, just 29 kidney transplants took place in Australia from living donors through the  Australia and New Zealand Paired Kidney Exchange Program. This figure represents a 42 per cent  drop compared to 2019.

Organ and Tissue Authority CEO, Lucinda Barry, said 2020 outcomes were primarily impacted by  the program’s suspension due to COVID-19 concerns in early-March, with the program gradually  returning in earnest from September.

“The reality is there were 210 fewer kidney transplants across living and deceased transplant  programs, mostly due to the impact of transplant program suspensions,” Ms Barry said.

“These suspensions were a responsible reaction to concerns within the health sector for hospital  capacity and transplant patient welfare as the global pandemic took hold in Australia.”

Minister Coulton said the report once again demonstrates the need for more Australians to discuss  donation with their friends and family and to register as a donor.

“We need all Australians to talk about organ and tissue donation, to understand what they and  their loved ones wish, and to register to become a donor at donatelife.gov.au,” Mr Coulton said.

“It takes less than a minute.”

2020 Australian Donation and Transplantation Activity Report  February 2021

Dr Peter Hughes - Clinical Director of the Australian and New Zealand Paired Kidney Exchange Program (VIC)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Peter is a nephrologist who qualified from Monash University and undertook his advanced training at the  Royal Melbourne Hospital and Austin Hospital.   Ã¯ÂÂ· He is the head of renal transplantation at The Royal Melbourne Hospital, the Clinical Director of the

Australian and New Zealand Paired Kidney Exchange Program and an Associate Professor at The University  of Melbourne.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Peter is available to talk about the ANZKX program and the challenges it faced in 2020.

Dr Stella McGinn - Renal Medicine, Nephrology (familiar with both Nick and Scott’s cases) (NSW)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Dr Stella McGinn is a staff specialist at Royal North Shore Hospital Sydney having trained in Ireland and in  Australia.  Ã¯ÂÂ· She has worked as a renal consultant both in the UK and Sydney. Since 2007 she has lead the renal

transplant program at Royal North Shore Hospital and has been working as Deputy Director of the  Australian and New Zealand Paired Kidney Exchange Program (ANZKX) since 2016.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Stella was involved in both Nick and Scott’s cases (below) and is available to talk about these as  well as the ANZKX program.

Nick Stathis - Kidney recipient ANZKX Program (ACT)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Nick received a kidney transplant as part of the ANZKX program in November 2020.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Nick had been on dialysis for 11 years after his original transplanted kidney failed in 2009.  Ã¯ÂÂ· During those 11 years he was not able to be matched with a kidney on the organ transplant waiting

list.

Ã¯ÂÂ· His wife Katrina was willing to be a donor but unfortunately she was not a compatible match for  Nick.   Ã¯ÂÂ· About five years ago Nick and Katrina agreed to be part of the Australian New Zealand Paired  Kidney Exchange Program (ANZKX).  Ã¯ÂÂ· In February 2020 Nick got a call saying that a suitable match had been found, however the surgery

was postponed due to COVID-19. His transplant eventually took place in November.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Nick says the biggest change in his life is not having to go to dialysis three days a week and having  all that extra time. It has changed not just his life but his families.

Scott - Kidney transplant recipient ANZKX Program (Regional NSW)  Ã¯ÂÂ· In late 2020, Scott received his third kidney transplant as part of the ANZKX program, following six  years waiting.  Ã¯ÂÂ· At the age of 10, Scott developed Nephritis, an inflammation of the kidney that causes scarring but

persisted with illness until the age of 17.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Scott’s story is unique. His first two kidney transplants were from his cousin and his mother.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Receiving his first kidney transplant from his cousin in 1997, Scott was in need of a new kidney

again 2009 when he received his mum’s kidney as his second transplant.



Ã¯ÂÂ· Unfortunately by 2012, Scott’s new transplanted kidney needed help, joining the ANZKX program  about six years ago.  Ã¯ÂÂ· His wife was willing to be a donor but unfortunately she was not compatible, due to his previous 2  transplants he had developed antibodies which meant there was a 1% chance of finding a match.  Ã¯ÂÂ· In September 2020, Scott received his third kidney transplant, and his wife donated a kidney

through the ANZKX program.

Patricia (Muffy) - Cornea transplant (NSW)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Patricia received a cornea transplant in May 2020.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Following a double cataract surgery, she was diagnosed with the genetic disorder Fuchs Dystrophy, a type  of eye disease that affects the cornea.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Patricia first noticed her eye issues when she couldn’t drive at night before reading became difficult. By

March this year reading regular print was impossible with or without glasses and her eyes were drying  closed at night.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Within two weeks of the first transplant, Patricia was already reading and driving again.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Patricia is hugely grateful to both her donors for giving her more time to spend with her two children. She  feels that in some way her donors are alive and well in herself.

Makayla - Meniscus transplant (QLD)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Makayla had been suffering from knee problems since her teens and might have been in a wheelchair by  her mid-twenties if it weren’t for a meniscus transplant in 2020.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Following multiple surgeries to fix the issue, her left meniscus was so badly injured it was removed at the

age of 14.   Ã¯ÂÂ· With the threat of developing an arthritic joint, Makayla was incapacitated for more than six years,  struggling with pain until a donor transplant was matched.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Makayla’s surgery was particularly difficult as meniscus cannot be stretched and requires the donor tissue

to be an exact fit to the recipient.  Ã¯ÂÂ· She recently climbed the Gold Coast’s tallest building as a testament to the adversity she’s overcome - and  her new lease on life thanks to her donor.



Darrell and Katie - living kidney donor/recipient couple (QLD)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Darrell received a kidney from his wife Katie in late 2020.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Due to a work accident, Darrell’s kidneys had deteriorated to only 8 per cent function and he  needed a kidney transplant.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Katie found out they were a match and Darrell was eligible to take her kidney as a transplant,

however Katie would not do it without getting married!  Ã¯ÂÂ· They had just 30 days to organise a wedding before the scheduled surgery date in July, this was in  the middle of COVID-19 lockdowns in Queensland.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Although surgery was rescheduled twice, donation still occurred within weeks of their nuptials.

Both are happy and doing well.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Darrell is a very friendly and approachable person. Katie is a little more reserved but both are  happy and willing to share their story to talk about the importance of organ and tissue donation.

2020 Australian Donation and Transplantation  Activity Report

Report

Ã¢ÂÂ²  In 2020, Australia’s organ donation and transplantation rates dropped due  to the emergence of COVID-19 in Australia.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Challenges facing hospitals and with logistics - including COVID-19  restrictions, flight reductions and border closures - affected the national  program throughout the year.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  The transplant sector took precautionary steps and suspended the adult  kidney and pancreas transplant programs from 24 March through to mid-May.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Elective surgery was suspended from 25 March, including kidney transplants  and the Australia and New Zealand Kidney Exchange (ANZKX) Program.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Donation and transplantation doctors and nurses have worked incredibly  hard to minimise any impacts on people needing a transplant.

Transplantation is an  effective and well-established  treatment that saves lives,  restores health and improves  quality of life.

Transplantation relies on  the donation of organs and  tissues.

There are currently around  1,650 Australians waitlisted  for an organ transplant.

We thank and acknowledge the generous  Australians and their families who chose to  save the lives of others in 2020 by saying   ‘yes’ to donation.

We also acknowledge the dedication  and commitment of our donation and  transplantation doctors, nurses and   support staff.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  In 2020, Australia’s deceased organ donation and  transplantation rates dropped due to the emergence  of COVID-19 in Australia.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  There was a 12% decrease in the number of people  receiving a transplant and a 16% decrease in the  number of donors compared to 2019.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  While the number of organ donors and transplant  recipients dropped during March and April due to the  temporary suspension of the kidney and pancreas.

transplant programs,1,270 Australians still received  transplants from 463 deceased organ donors in 2020.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Australia’s donation rate in 2019 had doubled since  the Australian Government’s national program began  in 2009. Our nationally coordinated program focuses  on a best-practice clinical system driven by DonateLife  specialists in hospitals combined with increasing  community awareness.

Australia’s potential deceased organ donor population and transplantation outcomes

Key

58%

463deceased organ donors and their families saved and transformed the  lives of 1,270 organ recipients.

~2%Only around 2% of people who die in Australian hospitals can be  considered for organ donation.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  With donation possible in so few cases, and with so many people needing  an organ transplant, it is vital more people say ‘yes’ to donation.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  There are some medical conditions, such as active cancer, which may  mean the patient is not a suitable organ donor.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  There are currently around 1,650 Australians waitlisted for a transplant  and more than 12,000 additional people are on dialysis - many who may  need a kidney transplant.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Many more people can become eye and tissue donors. Eye and other  tissues can be donated up to 24 hours after death, and donors do not  have to die in a hospital.

Organ donation is a   rare event.

Not everyone can become  an organ donor when they  die. To be an organ donor, a  person must die in a hospital’s  intensive care unit (ICU) or  emergency department (ED)  and be medically assessed as  suitable to donate organs for  transplantation.

Organ transplants from deceased donors

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Kidneys make up more than half of organs  transplanted, followed by liver, lungs and heart.   There were 153 less kidney transplants (18% down   on 2019).

Ã¢ÂÂ²  There were also 25 less lung transplants (14% down)  and 34 less liver transplants (11% down on 2019).

Ã¢ÂÂ²  The number of hearts and pancreas transplants  increased compared with 2019. There were 35 more  heart transplants (31% up on 2019) and seven more  pancreas transplants (18% up on 2019).

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Heart transplants increased notably in NSW where  St Vincent’s Hospital has a world leading program  transplanting hearts from circulatory death donors.

Organ transplants in Australia and New Zealand

In 2020, there were a small number of transplants in Australia of suitable organs (primarily livers, lungs  and occasionally hearts) from New Zealand donors that were not able to be matched in New Zealand.  Similarly, a small number of organs from Australian donors were transplanted in New Zealand.   In previous years only organs transplanted from Australian donors have been reported.

The Transplant Society of Australia and New Zealand is funded by the Organ and Tissue Authority to  develop and maintain protocols for the allocation of deceased organ donors to waitlisted patients  across Australia and New Zealand.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  There are two pathways to deceased donation:  Donation after Brain Death (DBD) and Donation after  Circulatory Death (DCD).

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Most donors are from the DBD pathway. In 2020, 325  deceased organ donors (70%) came from the DBD  pathway, with 138 (30%) from the DCD pathway.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  The 2020 donation target for deceased donation was  25.0 donors per million population (dpmp).

Ã¢ÂÂ²  The 463 deceased organ donors in 2020 resulted in a  national donation rate of 18.0 dpmp, a decrease from  the rate in 2019 (21.6 dpmp).

Ã¢ÂÂ²  There was a 14% decrease in the number of donors  from the DBD pathway and a 20% decrease in the  number of donors from the DCD pathway. Typically  DCD results in a lower number of organs suitable for  transplantation compared with DBD.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  The transplantation rate was 49.4 transplant recipients  per million population (trpmp); lower than 2019   (56.9 trpmp).

2020 Australian Donation and Transplantation Activity Report 8

Ã¢ÂÂ²  In Australia, families of potential donors are always asked to consent to their family  member becoming a donor.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Our national consent rate dropped to 58 per cent in 2020 meaning less people said  “yes” to donation.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  There is no doubt that the COVID-19 restrictions in hospitals contributed to this  decrease. Even in such challenging circumstances, families were still motivated to  donate and help others through donation.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Increasing the number of families saying ‘yes’ to donation is critical to further growth   in donation.

The importance of registration and family discussion

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Consideration of organ and tissue donation comes at an  intensely emotional time for families, usually associated  with the unexpected death of their loved one.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  When donation is a possibility, it helps when families  know what their loved one wanted.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  In 2020, 89% of families agreed to donation when  their family member was registered to donate on the  Australian Organ Donor Register (AODR).

Ã¢ÂÂ²  While the majority of Australians support organ and tissue  donation, one in three (34%) are registered to be a donor on the  AODR.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Tasmania and South Australia have the highest consent rates  (74% and 67% respectively). They also have high registration rates  (48% and 71% respectively). Registering to become a donor and  talking to your family about your decision has a direct influence on  consent rates.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  South Australia is the only state where individuals can register to be  a donor on their driver’s licence.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Consent for donation was given in 66% of cases when  the family had prior knowledge of the wishes of their  loved one.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  This dropped to only 44% of families agreeing to  donation when the family was unaware of their wishes.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Due to COVID-19 there were significantly fewer community events driving registrations.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  There are now over 7 million people registered on the AODR. This is 34% of the eligible Australian  population (i.e. aged 16 or over).

Ã¢ÂÂ²  There are around 265 donation specialist nurses,  doctors and support staff covering 95 hospitals across  Australia.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  The donation specialists work with hospital critical  care teams to ensure that, when appropriate, the  opportunity for organ donation is offered to families.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  A key factor to increasing consent are having donation  raised by a donation specialist nurse or doctor, and  providing families with high-quality information and  care during the donation process.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  In 2020, 62% Australian families agreed to donate  when they were supported by a donation specialist  (compared with 63% in 2019). This dropped to 24%  when there was no donation specialist involved  (compared with 30% in 2019).

2020 Australian Donation and Transplantation Activity Report 11

Ã¢ÂÂ²  A living organ donor is someone who donates a kidney,  or on rare occasions a partial liver, to another person.  Receiving an organ from a living donor offers an  alternative to waiting on the national transplant waiting  list for an organ from a deceased donor.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Living kidney donation and transplantation is most  often directly from a relative or close friend (directed  donation), though for some patients who are eligible  for a kidney transplant and have a living donor who  is willing but unable to donate directly because of  an incompatible blood or tissue type, it is facilitated  through the Australian and New Zealand Paired Kidney  Exchange (ANZKX) program.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Living kidney donation programs were disrupted  in 2020 with the suspension of kidney transplant

programs and elective surgery in March due to the  COVID-19. While gradual recommencement of living  kidney transplantation occurred from May 2020, the  complexities of the ANZKX program meant kidney  exchange transplants in Australia did not recommence  until September 2020. As well as ongoing logistical  challenges due to border restrictions and reduced  domestic flights, potential exchanges with New Zealand  donors and recipients were further impacted by  international travel restrictions.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  There were 182 living donors in 2020 - 181 kidney  donors and one partial liver donor. This result is   24% lower than the 2019 outcome of 239.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  The 181 living kidney donors in 2020 included 29  through the ANZKX program compared with 50 in 2019.

Overlap of deceased organ, eye and tissue donors

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Each year the lives of thousands of Australians are  saved and transformed through the transplantation of  donated tissues, including eye tissue.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  The tissues that can be transplanted include heart  valves and other heart tissue, bone, tendons,  ligaments, skin and parts of the eye such as the cornea  and sclera.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Unlike organs, many more people can become eye and  tissue donors as these can be donated following death   outside of hospital, and tissue can be stored for longer  periods of time.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Tissue banks across Australia collect tissue from  deceased and living donors, process and store these  tissues and then distribute them to clinicians for  transplantation and other surgical uses.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  The eye and tissue sector experienced an impact  on donation and transplantation activity in 2020,  particularly early in the year as a result of the  emergence of COVID-19.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Of the 463 deceased organ donors, 254 also donated  eye and/or other tissue.

Eye donation and transplantation

Ã¢ÂÂ²  In 2020 there were 1,318 deceased eye donors. This is a 13% decrease in the number of   eye donors compared with 2019 (1,508).

Ã¢ÂÂ²  There were 2,277 corneal transplants in 2020, a 6%  decrease compared with 2019 (2,414).

Ã¢ÂÂ²  Since 2009, more than 23,500 Australians have  received a corneal transplant.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  In 2020 there were 10,817 reported tissue transplant  recipients from both living and deceased donors.   This is a 3% increase over 2019 (10,453).

Ã¢ÂÂ²  The tissue transplant recipients included 10,375  recipients of musculoskeletal tissue, 213 recipients  of cardiovascular tissue, 96 recipients of skin tissue,  six recipients of pancreas islets and 127 recipients of  amnion tissue.

Note: Amnion transplants commenced in 2019.

Ã¢ÂÂ²  While the number of tissue donations decreased in  2020 due to COVID-19 impacts, the overall number  of tissue transplant recipients increased. This can be  partially explained by the fact that donated tissue can  be stored and used at a later stage, with little impact  resulting from disruptions to donation activity as a  result of the emergence of COVID-19.
