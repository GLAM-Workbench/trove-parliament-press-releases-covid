Rental Report Reveals Tenants’ Covid Struggle

Australian Greens Housing spokesperson Senator Mehreen Faruqi has said that AHURI’s Renting in the time of COVID-19: understanding the impacts report, released today, has shone a light on the struggles of renters during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Senator Faruqi said:

“Renters are doing it very tough. The findings of this report confirm many of the fears we’ve had for renters throughout this crisis. Many are earning less, living precariously, and being refused rent reductions.

“The government needs a plan to manage the immense rental stress people are experiencing, and which will worsen as the government continues to withdraw income support.

“There were no measures in last week’s budget to address housing affordability or ensure that people will not have to go hungry to keep a roof over their heads.

“The government must reverse their cruel cuts to income support and invest in social housing to ensure accessible, affordable and sustainable homes for everyone who needs one.

“I call on the National Cabinet to ensure eviction bans are in place so this public health and economic crisis doesn’t leave more and more people in a homelessness crisis,” she said.
