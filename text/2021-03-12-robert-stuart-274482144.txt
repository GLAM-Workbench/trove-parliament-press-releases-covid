‘The really good thing about the Digital Marketplace is we are now more discoverable as a  business and this affords us greater opportunity to be considered for, and potentially win  government work,’

‘We simply don’t have the large budget of large organisations to promote our business so we  regularly use the Digital Marketplace to get visibility and access to government opportunities and,  in turn, provides visibility of our business and capability and this has allowed us to grow the  business.’

‘When we first joined the Digital Marketplace, there were only a few broad categories.  That has  now expanded to 17 and this allows SMEs to specialise their capability and not be too broad with  their offerings. We also have partnerships with some larger firms and hopefully with the new  platform integration category, this might enable us to get access to larger transformational  projects.’

‘The growth of Aboriginal businesses on the Marketplace has been encouraging for the Indigenous  digital sector and for government buyers. A couple of years ago there were only five, but now  there is over 50.’

‘I believe it is increasingly important for SMEs to better articulate their case studies when being  assessed for various categories. My advice is to focus on what you can do and don’t be too broad.  And focus particularly on how you can assist government arrive at cost-effective solutions.’

The Digital Marketplace has helped ‘1448’ to grow and expand their digital business and tailor  their service offering to Government.

1448 is a regional-NSW based SME and one of several small businesses on the Digital  Transformation Agency’s (DTA’s) Digital Marketplace achieving solid growth and scale.

Since its inception in 2015, 1448 has been awarded 22 government contracts, including with  Department of Health, Home Affairs and Department of Finance.

1448 derives its name from it street address in Sutton, NSW and is currently approved against 6  categories on the Digital Marketplace. Co-founded by Simone Fox and Rohan Lane, the digital  services company now employs around 50 people.

During the COVID-19 period of 2020, 1448 demonstrated their knowledge and capacity of the  business travel and expense management processes, by uplifting 5 agencies in parallel to an end -to-end business process and solution.

Simone Fox said that while it is good to be across the volume of opportunities coming through the  Digital Marketplace, 1448 has grown the business aligned to their capability and skill-set. It is  vital for them to understand and filter those opportunities that provide the best fit  professionally  and culturally to help grow their business and expertise.

‘It is really effective for our business, as I'm sure it is for other digital businesses, and particularly  the visibility of the opportunities thread and daily summary email. It's always a streamlined  process (with the Digital Marketplace) from viewing and considering opportunities, assessing the  merits or otherwise of our business' suitability, to submitting a proposal, it is so logical and  straight-forward,’ she said.

‘The traditional old (procurement) methods were not as intuitive, whereas the Di gital Marketplace  is very easy.’

‘We generally know the environment and we know the culture that we can be most effective in.  We ensure that we understand the problems that need solving. And we determine the right  resource-fit required, continually improving our approach and process, through our team's  exposure to key agency people, programs and processes.’

‘Most importantly we attract the right staff, who integrate seamlessly into agencies’ multi -disciplinary teams, with the right technical ability, attitude and a focus on delivering quality  outcomes.’
