MEDIA RELEASE  AGED CARE

Community has lost confidence in the Government and Minister on aged  care

The Greens say that the community has lost confidence in the Government's  ability to manage aged care calling their handling of the crisis and failure to take  responsibility a debacle.

“Aged care is a debacle in this country”, Greens spokesperson on Ageing  Senator Rachel Siewert said.

“We have no national coordinating body to address the COVID crisis in aged  care.

“We have a regulator that is not regulating effectively.

“We have a Government failing on workforce.

“When I asked about infectious disease control training only about half of staff  have done an online infection control training and the Government thinks this is  adequate.

“The Prime Minister and the Minister need to improve their approach or the  Minister has to go.

“It was not inevitable that COVID was going to spread extensively into aged  care.

“We know that some providers have done the work to make sure that COVID  did not get in or spread.

“The additional $171m in funding for aged care announced last week is too little  and the sector needs an urgent injection of at least $3billion as a matter of  urgency.

"We are all sick of the buck passing and failure to take responsibility. Urgent  action is needed.

"If this appalling failure isn’t improved urgently then the Minister needs to go."

"The buck stops with the Prime Minister and he needs to take action.
