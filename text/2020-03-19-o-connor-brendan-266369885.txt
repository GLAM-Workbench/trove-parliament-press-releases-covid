UNDEREMPLOYMENT HITS RECORD HIGH



Today’s labour force figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) are

sobering, but just the beginning of what Australians are set to face.



The number of underemployed Australians reached a new record high at over 1.18 million.



Australians face difficult times ahead in terms of unemployment and underemployment,

because of COVID 19, and as reported by the ABS, early impacts are usually most evident

in the monthly hours worked, which decreased by 3.0 million hours.



Federal Labor will work constructively with the government to ensure Australians have the

best possible response to the health crisis we are facing.



There are a number of things we urge the government to consider:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Support for sole traders who are exasperated that not one single cent of support

from the government’s stimulus package will go directly to them.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Otherwise viable small businesses that are struggling or have ceased trading have

raised concerns the original small business economic stimulus package is not

enough to keep them going let alone filter through to their employees.



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ More support is needed for vulnerable casual workers.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Government should examine whether workers who have now found

themselves unemployed but not eligible for the $750 stimulus, are not falling

through the cracks.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Urgently assess whether any face-to-face mutual obligation activity - in light of the

latest health advice - are appropriate at this time. People should not be put in

harms way - and risk spreading the virus through our community should not be

increased - because people are afraid of having their payments cut off.

Labor’s priority will always be to protect jobs, help Australian workers, businesses, families

and communities through this difficult time, and ensure vulnerable Australians are

supported.
