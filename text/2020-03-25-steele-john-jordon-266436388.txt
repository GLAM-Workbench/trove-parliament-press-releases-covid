DISABLED PEOPLE AND CARERS NEED THE $550 COVID-19  SUPPLEMENT

Wednesday 25 March, 2020



Australian Greens disability spokesperson Senator Jordon Steele-John has  called on Minister Ruston to urgently extend the COVID-19 supplement  payment, announced as part of the government’s second round of stimulus, to  disabled people receiving the disability support pension and to carers who  receive the carer support payment.

“Minister Ruston has been given extraordinary powers up until the end of this  year which enable her to introduce measures to ensure that Australians who  receive income support can get through this crisis.

“The poverty rate amongst disabled people is extremely high compared to the  rate amongst the rest of the population and we face significant barriers to  entering the workforce. Now we are also dealing with extra costs for transport  and medical supplies, as well as personal protective equipment to keep us  safe.

"That’s why I’m imploring Minister Ruston to use those powers immediately to  extend the coronavirus supplement to Australians who receive the disability  support pension and the carer support payment.

“On Monday we saw government acknowledge they had left students on Youth  Allowance, AuStudy and ABStudy out of their stimulus package and rectify it  immediately. They need to do the same with the DSP and the carers support  payment.

“Australia's peak disability organisations have called on the Minister to urgently  reconsider this decision because many services disabled people rely on are  being closed or withdrawn, adding to the expenses people are already facing.

"It is unacceptable that disabled people have been excluded from this stimulus  package and the Greens are calling on Minister Ruston to act urgently to



ensure that people in our community who are at risk can access the COVID-19  supplement to help them get through this crisis."
