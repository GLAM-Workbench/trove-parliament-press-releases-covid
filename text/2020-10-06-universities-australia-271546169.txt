The Government has this evening added $1 billion to the nation’s research effort,



allowing universities to secure an important and continuing role in national recovery.



Universities Australia Chair Professor Deborah Terry welcomed the significant



investment as critical to the nation’s economic recovery.



“The Government clearly understands you can’t have an economic recovery without



investing in research and development.”



“This will ensure world-class research and discovery can continue on Australia’s



university campuses. That means universities can play their part in the national effort



to rebuild the economy.”



“The injection of an additional $1 billion will stabilise university research capacity and



jobs.”



“Today’s announcement shows that Government has heard the alarm bells.”



“This deals with the very serious short-term issues caused by COVID-19.”



“Universities also look forward to working in partnership with Education Minister Dan



Tehan to find longer-term solutions to sustain university research.”



The Government also announced it will provide $550 million over the next four years to



help students and universities.



“This includes 50,000 new short courses, which will be especially important for mature-



aged workers looking for new skills.”



“This adds to the 12,000 new university places to meet increased demand due to



COVID-19.”



“Both of these important initiatives recognise the need for more education during



economic hard times and allow universities to offer places to Australians keen to learn.”



“This means there are new places for young and older Australians to study and improve



their skills right when Australia needs them most,” Professor Terry added.
