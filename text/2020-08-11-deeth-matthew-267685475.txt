A NEW SPORTING COMPLEX FOR TAHMOOR

Construction has begun on a new Tahmoor District Sporting Complex, with a vision to  create a district level sports precinct that will meet the long-term needs of Wollondilly.

Funding from the $190 million Western Parkland City Liveability Program has made it  possible to bring the first stage of the Master Plan to life.

The program is part of the Western Sydney City Deal, which is delivering on its city-shaping vision, supporting growth and innovation, and creating job opportunities to build  a resilient and sustainable Parkland City.

Federal Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure Alan Tudge  said community infrastructure is key to the Morrison Government’s jobs-led recovery  from COVID-19.

“The Western Sydney City Deal is creating jobs and boosting quality of life,” Mr Tudge  said.

“Kicking off construction on the Tahmoor District Sporting Complex means local jobs on  the ground right now.”

NSW Minister for Jobs, Investment, Tourism and Western Sydney Stuart Ayres said it is  exciting to see projects that are supported by the Western Parkland City Liveability  Program start to take shape. I look forward to seeing this sporting complex become a  reality for the people of Tahmoor and the whole district.

Federal Minister for Energy and Emissions, and member for Hume Angus Taylor said the  construction of new facilities is critical to activating new job opportunities for Hume.

“We are creating jobs in local communities to build the foundations of the post-COVID-19  recovery,” Mr Taylor said.

Member for Wollondilly, Nathaniel Smith MP said I’m looking forward to turning up to the  Tahmoor District Sporting Complex in years to come to watch sporting events for all ages  and cheering on our local teams at a fantastic new sports facility.



Wollondilly Shire Mayor Matthew Deeth said planning with the community through the  Master Plan process, has allowed us to turn the existing Tahmoor Sportsground into a  modern, user-friendly facility that our local sporting groups and the community can be  proud of.

“The upgrade will ensure longevity of the site as a district level sporting complex to cater  for Wollondilly’s growing population over the next 20 years,” Cr Deeth said.

Updates on the project and notification of access restrictions due to construction activity  will be available on Council’s website https://www.wollondilly.nsw.gov.au/council/shire-projects/council-projects/tahmoor-sporting-complex/.
