VIRTUAL SUMMIT WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA

I am pleased to announce that I will join the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, the Honourable  James Marape MP, for a Virtual Summit on Wednesday, 5 August 2020.

This will be our second Papua New Guinea-Australia Leaders’ Dialogue. In the year since our inaugural  Dialogue in July 2019, we have supported each other as family.

This was on display through Papua New Guinea’s Operation Helpim Wantok support to Australia’s  bushfire recovery and Australia’s ongoing support to help Papua New Guinea overcome the shared  challenge of the COVID-19 global pandemic.

Australia and Papua New Guinea share a broad-ranging and ambitious relationship. Discussions during  the Virtual Summit will focus on the impacts of COVID-19 on our region and strategies for economic  recovery. We will also discuss opportunities to strengthen bilateral cooperation across the breadth of  economic and security issues.

I look forward to speaking with Prime Minister Marape and building on Australia and Papua New  Guinea’s shared interests in a secure, stable, peaceful, prosperous and democratic region.
