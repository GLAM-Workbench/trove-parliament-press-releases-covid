The Hon Nola Marino MP Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Territories

Eric Hutchinson reappointed as Administrator of Norfolk Island I am pleased to announce Mr Eric Hutchinson has been reappointed as the Administrator of the Territory of Norfolk Island.

Mr Hutchinson commenced as Administrator on 1 April 2017 and was reappointed for a second term on 1 April 2019. The current appointment commences on 1 April 2021 for a further two years.

The role of Administrator is an important public office. As the Australian Government’s senior representative in Norfolk Island, the role includes administering key statutory, civic and ceremonial responsibilities for the local community as well as advocating for their interests.

Mr Hutchinson has shown great commitment to the Norfolk Island community as Administrator over the past four years. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the important role he has played in helping to protect the community through the COVID-19 pandemic over the last 12 months, and his ongoing dedication to supporting the sustainable social and economic development of the island into the future.

In his new term, Mr Hutchinson will continue his important role in heritage management as chair of the Kingston and Arthur’s Vale Historic Area (KAVHA) Advisory Committee.

Mr Hutchinson said he was honoured to be reappointed as Administrator of Norfolk Island, a role that is both challenging and rewarding.

I know that Mr Hutchinson will continue his service to the people of Norfolk Island throughout his next term, and look forward to working closely with him as we continue to modernise legislation, transition a range of state services and with the community establish future priorities for a strong and sustainable Norfolk Island.
