Statement from Minister Littleproud

In response to comments by the Deputy Premier of Queensland, Steven Miles

I won’t be lectured to by a man who was sacked as health minister and a government that  was derelict in their duty of protecting their frontline health workers by not having them fully  vaccinated before they treated COVID patients.

His statements today also show why he and his government are incompetent, my  statements pertained to assisting the Qld government roll out the vaccines they’ve left in  the rack rather than in health workers arms.
