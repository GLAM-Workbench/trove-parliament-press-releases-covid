Morrison Government urges negotiation to resolve Jetstar/TWU dispute

Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial relations, Christian Porter, today called on the  Transport Workers Union and Jetstar to continue negotiations in the face of an escalation of  industrial action against Jetstar.

“Australia’s tourism sector has already been hit hard by the impact of bushfires and, more  recently, the coronavirus outbreak,” Mr Porter said

“In particular the many small businesses and regional areas that rely heavily on a strong  domestic and international tourism market face further damage from any industrial action  which disrupts travel and holiday plans of Australians and overseas visitors.

“This is not the right time to use the actuality or threat of escalated actions to leverage  negotiating advantage.  That is ultimately bad for workers because any escalation in industrial  action will only cause further harm to the image of Australia as an international tourist  destination and will also impact on the confidence of domestic travellers as they consider  local travel plans.

“The parties should return to the bargaining table and negotiate in good faith.  Reasonable  offers should be put by both sides and fully considered in an effort to resolve the matter and  minimise harm to employees, the employer and the travelling public.”
