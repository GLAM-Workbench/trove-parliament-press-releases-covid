ONLY LABOR WILL GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT A VOICE IN NATIONAL

CABINET



Labor Leader Anthony Albanese has today announced that local government will have a seat

at the National Cabinet table in an Albanese Labor Government.



“It is an insult to every Mayor and Councillor in Australia that the Prime Minister kicked them to

the kiddies table when National Cabinet was created last year,” Shadow Minister for Housing,

Homelessness, Territories and Local Government Jason Clare said.



“This insult came without warning after 28 years of local government representation on the

previous peak national decision-making body, the Council of Australian Government (COAG).”



In the past 18 months, local government has demonstrated its community value more than

ever before. Through bushfires, floods, and the coronavirus pandemic, local councils has often

been the foundation of community support and the point of first response.



Regrettably, throughout this crisis local government has been simply taken for granted and

ignored by the Federal Government.



Every level of government should have a voice at National Cabinet - Federal, State and Local.
