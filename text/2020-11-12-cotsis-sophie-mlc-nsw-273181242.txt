DIGITAL SERVICES: GOVERNMENT MUST PRIORITISE CYBER  SECURITY AND ACCESS

Labor says the Government must urgently address cyber security and access  issues after it re-announced funding to digitise services in the upcoming  budget.

The Government confirmed it will spend $700 million in this budget to expand  digital capabilities across agencies and departments. However, the Shadow  Minister for Better Public Services Sophie Cotsis said more pressing issues  need to be addressed.

“Digitisation is important for access but the Government needs to fix the terrible  mobile services and telecommunications issues that are common in regional  and rural NSW,” Ms Cotsis said.

“In some lower socio-economic suburbs only 30% of people have access to  technology or Wi-Fi and rely on a McDonald’s or Westfield shopping centre for  connectivity.

“And in bushfire-ravaged communities, the Government still has a lot of work to  do.”

A 2018 report from the Auditor-General repeatedly warned that Government  agencies were grossly ill-prepared for cyber attacks and recommended urgent  cyber security measures should be implemented.





In a 2020 report on local government, the Auditor-General found:    Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 80% of councils do not have formal cyber security policy / framework;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 46% of councils have not included the threat of cyber attacks in their risk  register.

“There are a number of issues that need to be addressed and re-announcing  funds isn’t going to get them sorted,” Ms Cotsis added.

The move to further digitise state systems comes just months after cyber  criminals stole 3.8 million documents, including health records, legal  information and finances from Service NSW.

Ms Cotsis was among the 186,000 people whose personal information was  stolen.

“The Government is talking about learning the lessons from COVID-19. I hope  they’ve learnt their lesson from the recent Service NSW data breach,” she said.

“It is critical to ensure sensitive information is safeguarded at every step of this  rollout. This is the Government’s responsibility and it must be taken seriously.

“The Government said the attack occurred because Service NSW did not use  multi-factor authentication for staff log-ins, which means the NSW Government  has not been following guidance from the Australian Cyber Security Centre.  This is among many issues that must be urgently addressed.”

At the recent cybersecurity inquiry, witnesses raised concerns about the  Government’s lack of cybersecurity framework and preparedness. The inquiry  is ongoing.
