STATEMENT ON THE SECOND ECONOMIC RESPONSE TO

CORONAVIRUS



Labor is supportive of the Government’s second economic response

announced today.



Labor will continue to work responsibly and constructively with the Government,

including on the passage of legislation through the Parliament.



While there are some welcome measures in this package, Labor is concerned

this response lacks urgency, leaves gaps in support and does not go far

enough to protect jobs.



No measure announced today guarantees that support will be used to keep

workers on, and many struggling households could miss out on support.



Every Australian needs the Government to get this right, which means getting

the original stimulus and today’s additional measures out the door as soon as

possible, and urgently closing the gaps identified by Labor and others.



This is no time for half measures or delay.



To meet the scale of this challenge the Government’s response must be large

enough, deployed quickly enough and be targeted enough to support

livelihoods and prevent more job losses, business failures, and a more serious

economic downturn.



Labor is concerned that the Morrison Government’s latest response has not

substantially addressed some gaps we identified in the original stimulus, and

raises additional concerns which we will work through with the Government,

including:



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ No substantial support to protect jobs and no guarantee that businesses

receiving support will keep workers on;

o Concern that the Coronavirus Supplement may not be available

for some Australian families struggling to put food on the table,

particularly given there has been no change to the income test;

o Concern that payments to households, including to pensioners,

will arrive too late;

o Concern that cash flow assistance to businesses will arrive too

late and will not help otherwise viable businesses most at risk of

collapse;

o The lack of more substantial support for sole traders and the self-employed to help them stay in business;

o The absence of any direct support for renters, despite the Prime

Minister flagging this as a serious issue last week;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ No Coronavirus Supplement for students, even if they lose their part-time job or have their hours cut;

o That the expansion of early release superannuation risks

undermining retirement incomes and compromising financial

system stability, and should only be a last resort;

o The $1 billion regional and community support fund still lacks any

detail;

o The lack of more substantial support for charities, including food

banks, and organisations that provide essential services to

vulnerable Australians; and

o The absence of a coordinated, whole-of-economy plan, and lack

of sufficient support and planning for essential and strategic

industries, including but not limited to the airline industry,

childcare sector and the arts.



This unfolding economic crisis demands urgency, scale and coordination, but

the Morrison Government’s initial and subsequent responses have come too

late, been too slow, and have too many gaps.



Businesses are already closing, workers are already being laid off and many

vulnerable Australians are at serious risk.



Labor’s priority is to protect jobs, help Australian workers, businesses, families

and communities through this difficult time, and ensure vulnerable Australians

are supported.



We understand the people are anxious at the moment which is why Labor will

continue to be supportive, responsible and constructive and that means

injecting a sense of urgency where it is lacking or absent.



Australians need Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg to do a better job getting



this support out the door than they did with the drought relief, bushfire relief and

the original stimulus.
