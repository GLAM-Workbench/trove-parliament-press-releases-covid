HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS LOST

Job losses across the tourism sector have been further highlighted today in  evidence to the Select Committee on COVID-19.

Tourism is critical to our economy, contributing $100 billion to our GDP and  employing over one million people.

But this industry is hurting, as are the 300,000 odd Australian businesses that  rely on the sector and many of the one million people tourism directly and  indirectly employs.

“At any given time there are probably about 700,000 jobs direct jobs within our  sector, according to our projections at the moment we are sitting at only  230,000 employed, so the jobs are 65% down“  Tourism and Transport Forum

“The majority of our hotels in the CBD’s right around the country are operating  at 50-60 per cent down on the same time last year, with Sydney and Melbourne  hardest hit with room revenues down in excess of 75 per cent”  Tourism Accommodation Australia

“The visitor economy has halved over the course of this year”  Australian Tourism Industry Council

“We are getting pretty close to that line where businesses are going to have to  take some tough decisions”  Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry

It is clear the JobKeeper has been critical to the sector’s ability to withstand the  huge impact of the pandemic so far.



However, it is time for the Government to seriously consider what other support  the industry needs to survive, recover and rebuild so it can continue to provide  jobs and a very significant contribution to Australia’s economy.
