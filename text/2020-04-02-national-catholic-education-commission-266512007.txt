Catholic	Education	sector	welcomes	the	Australian

Government’s	early	learning	and	care	COVID-19	package

The	National	Catholic	Education	Commission	has	welcomed	the	Australian	Government’s	rescue

package	for	early	childhood	and	care	services	across	Australia.

Under	the	plan,	the	federal	government	estimates	around	one	million	families	will	receive	free

childcare,	and	the	government	will	pay	50	per	cent	of	the	sector’s	fee	revenue	up	to	the	existing

hourly	rate	cap.	The	support	would	also	apply	to	before	and	after	school	care	and	vacation	care

services.

National	Catholic	Education	Executive	Director	Jacinta	Collins	said	the	announcement	would

bring	great	relief	to	Catholic	early	childhood	and	care	services	across	Australia.

“The	Catholic	education	sector	operates	about	250	preschools	and	early	learning	centres

educating	nearly	5,000	children,	as	well	offering	before	and	after	school	care	and	vacation	care

to	families	at	many	Catholic	primary	schools	across	Australia,”	Ms	Collins	said.



“The	government’s	rescue	package	will	enable	those	services	to	keep	their	doors	open	for

essential	services	workers	during	the	COVID-19	pandemic.



“I’m	sure	this	announcement	will	bring	great	relief	to	operators	and	staff	of	these	services,	and

to	the	families	who	need	to	utilise	early	learning	and	child	care	over	the	coming	months,”	she

said.



The	government’s	package	will	enable	services	to	waive	gap	fees	for	families	who	keep	their

children	home,	and	families	will	be	able	to	access	an	additional	20	absence	days.



“The	government’s	assurances	that	early	learning	and	child	care	workers	will	be	able	to	access

the	JobKeeper	payment	is	very	reassuring,	given	the	uncertainty	the	sector	has	experienced	in

recent	weeks.”

The	Catholic	Education	sector	operates	about	250	preschool	and	early	learning	centres	educating

nearly	5,000	children,	as	well	as	a	large	number	of	before	and	after	school	and	vacation	care

services.	Most	services	are	located	onsite	with	Catholic	primary	schools.

Nationally,	Catholic	schools	educate	more	than	764,000	students	-	or	one	in	five	Australian

students	-	in	1,746	schools,	the	vast	majority	of	which	are	low-fee	schools.
