Action plan to boost Australia’s services exports

Post-COVID reform, trade expansion and diversification are at the heart of the Morrison  Government’s first national strategy to boost services exports beyond education and tourism.

Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Dan Tehan launched the Services Exports  Action Plan in Melbourne today.

The plan supports the international competitiveness of Australia’s world-class services  businesses and helps them find new export markets, grow their businesses, employ more  people and capitalise on the opportunities offered by international markets.

“Our Government is supporting Australia’s services businesses to capitalise on untapped  export potential that will drive growth and create jobs,” Mr Tehan said.

“From architecture, engineering and legal services, to health and financial services, digital  and communications, logistics and many other services - Australia has long-benefitted from  our expertise in these sectors.

“The Services Exports Action Plan will play a critical role in expanding our exports of these  services to the world.

“The Morrison Government will continue to work with industry to boost our international  competitiveness and assist Australian businesses to succeed in global markets.”

The Plan was co-designed with industry and identifies 81 actions that both government and  industry are progressing. It recognises that advancing services exports is best achieved  through a partnership between government and business.

The Action Plan website is at www.services-exports.gov.au.
