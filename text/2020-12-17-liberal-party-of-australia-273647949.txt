Additional targeted support for students and families

The Morrison Government is building on its $51 billion investment in education contained in  the Budget through additional targeted measures to support students and families.

In the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the Government will provide:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $28.7 million to support a Professional Pathway Social Work to better support  students studying to become youth workers, counsellors or community workers.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ University of Notre Dame Australia will be recategorised as a Table A higher  education provider and will receive an additional $27.2 million over four years to

support the transition.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $1 million to provide up to 50 scholarships worth $18,000 to undergraduate students  from regional and remote Australia to study creative arts in 2021.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A deadline extension to 31 March 2021 for families receiving the Child Care Subsidy

to lodge their 2018-19 tax return to help alleviate COVID-19 related financial stress.

Minister for Education Dan Tehan said the promotion of University of Notre Dame to a Table  A university recognised its focus on student outcomes and industry engagement.

“As a Table A university, the University of Notre Dame will be eligible for new funding  arrangements provided under the Government’s Job-ready Graduates package, which will  create additional university places and provide $900 million to support universities to work  with local industry,” Mr Tehan said.

“The increased funding will support the conversion of approximately 2,200 non-medical  bachelor full fee-paying places at the university into Commonwealth supported places from  2021.

“We are also supporting families that are doing it tough because of COVID-19 by changing  the income reporting requirements for families who access the Child Care Subsidy.”
