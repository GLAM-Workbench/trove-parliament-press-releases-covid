ADF SUPPORTING NSW FLOOD EMERGENCY

Australian Defence Force (ADF) helicopters will today deploy to NSW to support search  and rescue activities for the flood emergency.

Additional ADF personnel and equipment will also deploy this week to assist with the  clearance and recovery operation.

The Acting Minister for Defence, Senator the Hon Marise Payne, said the ADF stands  ready to support state emergency services with the immediate response to the floods.

“Defence is working with the NSW State Emergency Operations Centre to determine how  it can further support and assist state emergency services with tasks such as assessing  damage to properties, clearing roads and helping restore electricity and water,” Minister  Payne said.

“Defence is well-equipped to provide further assistance if required, which was  demonstrated last year when the ADF provided support during the Black Summer  Bushfires, throughout COVID-19 and the recent bushfires in Western Australia.

“Once again, our ADF personnel are showing their professionalism and dedication in the  face of very difficult conditions. All Australians can be proud of the way Defence has been  assisting the emergency services across the country in these challenging circumstances.”

The Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management, the Hon David  Littleproud MP, said the New South Wales Government said the hard work of removing  flood affected property contents will be both demanding and dangerous.

“Defence has quickly got the ball rolling to provide the appropriate equipment and  personnel for the clean-up task,” Minister Littleproud said.

“The ADF has the heavy equipment and expertise to clear the roads to allow access to  those isolated in both urban and regional areas.

“This will allow experts in the civil sector to get in and repair critical infrastructure and  essential services.

“The amount of flood and storm debris to be removed will be enormous and could be  overwhelming for those trying to put their lives back together.

“They will be given comfort when the men and women in uniform turn up, stand shoulder  to shoulder with them and get the job done.”

Defence remains engaged with State and Federal agencies to ensure we expeditiously  deploy our personnel and capabilities where they are most needed.
