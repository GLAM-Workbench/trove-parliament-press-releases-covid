APPLICATIONS NOW OPEN FOR VETERAN AND COMMUNITY GRANTS

PROJECTS supporting the health and wellbeing of veterans and their families may be eligible for  funding, with applications for the Veteran and Community Grants (V&CG) program opening today.

Minister for Veterans’ Affairs Darren Chester said the health and wellbeing of the veteran  community was an ongoing priority, and the V&CG program was a way of supporting ex-service  organisations (ESOs) and partner community organisations in providing local solutions.

“Local communities know best what will benefit veterans and their families, whether that is  improvements that make community spaces safer and more accessible, equipment that will enable  COVID-safe activities, or assistance to connect online,” Mr Chester said.

“This year we are encouraging applications for practical projects and activities that support safe,  accessible environments for veterans and their families to enable social connection and positive  engagement to improve wellbeing.”

ESOs and community organisation partners are invited to apply for grants of up to $20,000 for local,  community-based projects and activities. A small number of large grants of up to $150,000 are  available for projects that deliver wellbeing support services and activities of broad-scale benefit to  the veteran community.

The 2020-21 grant round opens online today, and follows the successful Veterans’ Health Week  where social connection amidst the coronavirus pandemic was the theme and key focus of events.

“Social connection is one of the most important aspects of mental health and wellbeing. This year it  is more important than ever to remain socially connected with family, friends and our local  communities,” Mr Chester said.

“These grants will provide opportunities to community organisations to extend the important  support they provide to veterans and their families.”

Grant applications will close 29 January 2021. For information about how to apply see the  Community Grants Hub website: www.communitygrants.gov.au. Assistance with grant application  queries is also available by phone: 1800 020 283 or by email: support@communitygrants.gov.au.
