COVID-19: Supporting senior South Australians

Senior South Australians are being encouraged to seek support as the state responds to the  current COVID-19 outbreak.

Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Richard Colbeck, said the lockdown and  subsequent restrictions could increase anxiety and isolation for the most vulnerable.

“The care and wellbeing of senior South Australians is a priority for the Australian Government  as we collectively deal with this critical issue,” Minister Colbeck said.

“It is important senior South Australians, including those in aged care facilities, know support  is available - be it to arrange food or medication, access a GP, access information about  COVID-19, or just find someone to talk to.”

Minister Colbeck also urged providers to consider the Industry Code for Visiting Residential  Aged Care Homes During COVID-19 which ensures the response to the pandemic was  proportionate and in the best interests of the residents.

The Code, developed in conjunction with consumer peak bodies sets out a nationally consistent,  principles-based approach to maintaining residents’ visitation and communication, remains in  place.

“Connection remains vital during this difficult time, particularly for vulnerable Australians,  those suffering from dementia or in palliative care,” Minister Colbeck said.

“Providers have a responsibility to ensure residents can retain some form of contact.”

Additionally, the Australian Government’s has committed $1.6 billion to deliver the COVID-19 Aged Care Response Plan.

This includes $243.2 million to support older Australians at home during COVID-19 through  the Commonwealth Home Support Programme (CHSP), Home Care Packages and My Aged  Care.
