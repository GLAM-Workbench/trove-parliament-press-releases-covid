Australian wine secures fair trading terms

Ã¯ÂÂ· Australia and Canada have agreed to settle a number of Canadian measures that  were the subject of a WTO dispute  Ã¯ÂÂ· The agreement removes discriminatory trade barriers in Canada including in the  provinces of Ontario and Nova Scotia

Australian wine producers are toasting successful resolution of trade restrictions that have been a  long-running obstacle in our wine trade with Canada, our fourth largest wine export market.

Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management David Littleproud welcomed the  Canadian Government’s agreement to allow Australian wine to compete on a level playing field.

“With $185 million worth of Australian wine exported to Canada in 2019, this is a welcome outcome  for our producers and the economy,” Minister Littleproud said.

“As a result of our hard work and pressure through the World Trade Organization challenge,  Canada has agreed to remove over time, measures imposed by the Canadian federal government  and the provinces of Ontario and Nova Scotia which saw our wine producers disadvantaged.

“Australian wine producers will no longer bear the burden of discriminatory measures which gave  Canadian wine producers exemptions from taxes or more favourable mark-ups.

“Australian wine producers will also have more access to shelf space in Canada, including in  Ontario, Canada's most populous Province.

“This means valuable exposure for Brand Australia and more opportunities for our farmers to lead  Australia’s recovery out of Covid-19.

“We thank the Canadian Government for its co-operation in progressing this resolution.

“The successful negotiation of meaningful outcomes outside of the WTO dispute settlement  process speaks to the strength of our Australia and Canada's bilateral relationship.”

“What this should show our agricultural producers is that we aren’t just going to lie down and take  the imposition of unfair trade-restrictive policies from our trading partners.

“We are committed to the WTO rules-based system and if something is unfair we’re going to take it  to the WTO as the independent umpire.
