50,000 CASES OF ASSAULT AND ABUSE IN AGED CARE GO  UNREPORTED

It is completely unacceptable more than 50,000 cases of assault and abuse in aged care  across the country are going unreported each year.

The figures confirm just how broken our country’s aged care system is under the Morrison  Government.

The Morrison Government is still yet to introduce a serious incident response scheme that  would respond to cases of assault and abuse in Australia’s aged care system.

It has now been three years since this scheme was first recommended by the Australian  Law Reform Commission following its landmark investigation of elder abuse in Australia.

Even after the shocking figures estimating how many older Australians were being  assaulted and abused were released the failed Minister for Aged Care Richard Colbeck  could only commit ‘initial’ funding for a scheme.

A separate review commissioned by the Government following the Oakden nursing home  tragedy also recommended introducing the scheme in 2017.

How can anyone trust this Government to properly respond the Royal Commission into  Aged Care when it takes more than three years to respond to such an important  recommendation?

Labor has been calling for the implementation of this scheme since both reports were  released in 2017.

Australia’s aged care system was broken before the COVID-19 pandemic and this is only  putting extra stress on the system.

The Minister for Aged Care is not across basic details, he’s not in Cabinet and he’s been  cut out of the decision-making process. He walks away from scrutiny.

The Morrison Government must act now for our most vulnerable older Australians.
