APPOINTMENT OF THE NATIONAL VOCATIONAL EDUCATION  AND TRAINING (VET) REGULATOR

The Australian Government has announced the appointment of Ms Saxon Rice to the role of  the National Vocational Education and Training (VET) Regulator.

Ms Rice will serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Skills Quality Authority  (ASQA), starting from 1 January 2021, for a five-year term.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said ASQA has an important responsibility to protect and enhance the quality of  training in Australia.

“In her role as Chief Commissioner of ASQA since December 2019, Ms Rice has been  focused on the implementation of internal reforms, making significant progress to improve  engagement with training providers to help improve the quality of VET,” Minister Cash said.

“In addition, her work has ensured ASQA provided responsive and balanced support to  training providers throughout the COVID-19.

“I congratulate Ms Rice on her appointment and I’m confident ASQA is well-placed to  continue implementing the Government’s priorities which will ensure there is fair,  transparent and effective regulation of the VET sector.”

The Rapid Review of ASQA’s Regulatory Practices and Processes recommended internal  structural changes to ASQA to support implementation of reform to ASQA’s regulatory  approach and modernise its governance arrangements.

The governance changes to ASQA create the single statutory office of the National VET  Regulator and abolish all previous commissioner roles.

Dr Irene Ioannakis’ appointment as Deputy Chief Commissioner of ASQA will cease on  31 December 2020.

Assistant Minister for Vocational Education, Training and Apprenticeships, the Hon Steve  Irons MP, said Dr Ioannakis has made a positive contribution to ASQA since joining the  agency in 2017, supporting Government priorities for regulation of the VET sector.

“I thank her for her service, which has included addressing the challenges of COVID-19, and  more recently, in the reform process of ASQA.”
