INVESTMENT IN NEW ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES

The Morrison Government is investing in new and emerging technologies that will support jobs,  strengthen our economy and reduce emissions.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the $1.9 billion investment package in future technologies to lower  emissions would back jobs now and into the future, cut costs for households and improve the reliability  of our energy supply.

The Prime Minister said the Government is supporting the next generation of energy technologies with  an extra $1.62 billion for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to invest, as well as  expanding the focus of ARENA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) to back new  technologies that will cut emissions in agriculture, manufacturing, industry and transport.

“Our JobMaker plan is about protecting and creating the jobs of today and positioning Australia for the  jobs of the future, which is why our investment in new technologies is so crucial,” the Prime Minister  said.

“Australia is in the midst of a world-leading boom in renewable energy with over $30 billion invested  since 2017. Solar panels and wind farms are now clearly commercially viable and have graduated from  the need for government subsidies and the market has stepped up to invest.

“The Government will now focus its efforts on the next challenge: unlocking new technologies across  the economy to help drive down costs, create jobs, improve reliability and reduce emissions. This will  support our traditional industries - manufacturing, agriculture, transport - while positioning our  economy for the future.

“These investments create jobs and they bring new technologies into play. This will not only cut  emissions, but deliver the reliable energy Australia needs while driving down prices for homes and  businesses.”



The new package also invests in a range of promising low-emissions, reliable new technology  advancements including:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Supporting businesses in the agriculture, manufacturing, industrial and transport sectors to  adopt technologies that increase productivity and reduce emissions through a new $95.4 million

Technology Co-Investment Fund that was recommended by the King Review  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Piloting carbon capture projects that will dramatically help cut emissions with a $50 million  investment in the Carbon Capture Use and Storage Development Fund  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Helping businesses and regional communities take advantage of opportunities offered by

hydrogen, electric, and bio-fuelled vehicles with a new $74.5 million Future Fuels Fund  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Setting up a hydrogen export hub worth $70.2 million to scale-up demand and take advantage  of the advancements in this low emissions, high powered source of energy  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Backing new microgrids in regional and remote communities to deliver affordable, reliable

power with $67 million  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Contributing $52.2 million to increase the energy productivity of homes and businesses,  including a sector specific grant program for hotels supporting equipment and facilities upgrades  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Slashing the time taken to develop new Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) methods from 24

months or more to less than 12 months, involving industry in a co-design process and  implementing other recommendations from the King Review into the ERF, worth $24.6 million  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Boosting energy and emissions data and cyber-security reporting and supporting the delivery of  future Low Emissions Technology Statements under the Technology Investment Roadmap

process, as well as developing an offshore clean energy project development framework,  together worth $40.2 million

Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said getting the next generation of energy  technologies right would not only help to keep prices low and the lights on, but would importantly grow  jobs, strengthen the economy and reduce emissions.

“We will reduce the cost of new and emerging technologies, not raise the cost of existing technologies  or layer in new costs to consumers and businesses through mandated targets or subsidies,” Minister  Taylor said.

“The Government recognises the strong growth in emerging energy technologies that will play a role in  Australia’s energy mix into the future. We need to get the balance right and our investment to re-energise ARENA will deliver that.

“ARENA has played an important role in this growth, and as the cost of renewable technologies has  fallen dramatically, the Government is investing in the future of ARENA to support the next generation  of energy technologies.”

The Government’s emissions reduction strategy is focussed on technology not taxes. An approach that  doesn’t compromise energy affordability or reliability will be more important than ever as we recover  from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Government will provide ARENA with guaranteed baseline funding of $1.43 billion over 10 years.  ARENA’s baseline funding will be supplemented in two ways:

1. Together with the Clean Energy Regulator, ARENA will be approved to deploy a portion of the $2  billion Climate Solutions Fund; and  2. ARENA will also become a clean technology grants hub for future initiatives, with a new $193.4  million provided to deploy targeted programs.

The Boards of ARENA and CEFC will continue to be accountable for individual investment decisions. The  Government will introduce new legislation so both agencies can support new and emerging low  emissions technologies (including zero and negative emissions technologies). That ensures they will be  able to support critical technologies such as soil-carbon sequestration, carbon capture and storage,  production of green-steel, and industrial processes to reduce energy consumption.

This package will contribute to Australia’s continued success in meeting and beating our emissions  reduction targets. Australia beat its Kyoto-era targets by up to 430 million tonnes and the Government is  on track to meet and beat our 2030 Paris target.

As a nation, Australia has done far better than similar export-oriented countries with emissions now  14.3 per cent below 2005 levels. This is an achievement all Australians can be proud of.

Early-stage investment is a proven method to accelerate the development of new and emerging  technologies. The Technology Investment Roadmap will provide a strategic framework to prioritise the  Government’s investments.
