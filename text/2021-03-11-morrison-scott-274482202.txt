TOURISM AND AVIATION’S FLIGHT PATH TO RECOVERY

Australia’s airlines, hotels and caravan parks, restaurants and bars, travel agents and tourism  operators are set for a rush of hundreds of thousands of tourists as part of a new $1.2 billion support  package from the Morrison Government.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said while Australia’s economy had recovered 85 per cent of its fall  from COVID-19, the next step in the Government’s National Economic Recovery Plan would target  the businesses, workers and regions still doing it tough.

The Prime Minister said the package’s mix of half-price airline tickets, cheap loans for businesses and  direct support to keep planes in the air, and airline workers in their jobs, would be a bridge to a  more normal way of life for Australians.

“This is our ticket to recovery - 800,000 half-price airfares to get Australians travelling and  supporting tourism operators, businesses, travel agents and airlines who continue to do it tough  through COVID-19, while our international borders remain closed,” the Prime Minister said.

“This package will take more tourists to our hotels and cafes, taking tours and exploring our  backyard. That means more jobs and investment for the tourism and aviation sectors as Australia  heads towards winning our fight against COVID-19 and the restrictions that have hurt so many  businesses.”

“Our tourism businesses don’t want to rely on government support forever. They want their tourists  back. This package, combined with our vaccine roll-out which is gathering pace, is part of our  National Economic Recovery Plan and the bridge that will help get them back to normal trading.”

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development Michael  McCormack said the measures would work hand-in-hand to boost interstate tourism and aviation in  key regions significantly impacted by the loss of tourists.

“The new Tourism Aviation Network Support (TANS) Program will give Australians clear incentives to  travel to key domestic tourism areas,” the Deputy Prime Minister said.

“Discounts will be offered on tens of thousands of fares per week across an initial 13 key tourism  regions.

“We’re working with airlines to increase the number of flights to these tourism areas - giving  travellers the flexibility needed when organising dream holidays to destinations such as Tropical  North Queensland and Kangaroo Island.

“In a big win for local communities, especially in regional Australia, we will continue to financially  support flights which are so key to health services, employment opportunities and social activities.

“We’re also backing the workforces of our international airlines and the teams and infrastructure  they need so that when tourism takes off again and our borders reopen, our airlines are ready to  go.”

The half-price ticket program will initially operate to 13 key regions including; the Gold Coast, Cairns,  the Whitsundays and Mackay region (Proserpine and Hamilton Island), the Sunshine Coast, Lasseter  and Alice Springs, Launceston, Devonport and Burnie, Broome, Avalon, Merimbula, and Kangaroo  Island. Flights, routes and the total number of tickets will be driven by demand and are subject to  final discussions with the airlines.

The discounts will be off the average fare and will be available on airline websites from 1 April.

Other new measures in the support package include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ New International Aviation Support to help Australia’s international passenger airlines  maintain more than 8,000 core international aviation jobs  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Support for regular passenger airports to meet their domestic security screening costs  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A new Aviation Services Assistance Support Program to help ground-handling companies

meet the costs of mandatory training, certification and accreditation to ensure they  maintain their workforces so they can stand them back up when the market expands again.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The reinstatement of domestic aviation security screening cost rebates for more than 50  regular passenger airports

The Morrison Government will expand and extend its ‘SME Loan Guarantee Scheme’ as part of its  commitment to support up to $40 billion in lending to small and medium enterprises.

Under the existing Scheme, more than 35,000 loans worth more than $3 billion have already been  provided, helping thousands of small businesses get to the other side of this pandemic.

As we move into the recovery phase, the Scheme will be targeted and tailored to support those  businesses that have been relying on JobKeeper during the March quarter.

The SME Recovery Loan Scheme will benefit from an increased Government guarantee, increasing  from the current 50/50 split between the Government and the banks to an 80/20 split. This will  encourage more banks to support small businesses and demonstrates the Government’s  commitment to back those businesses that are prepared to back themselves.

The expanded Scheme will also increase the size of eligible loans, increasing from $1 million under  the current Scheme to $5 million. Businesses with a higher turnover will also benefit under the  expanded Scheme, with the maximum eligible turnover increased from $50 million to $250 million.

Maximum loan terms under the expanded Scheme will also be increased from 5 to 10 years -  providing businesses and lenders with greater flexibility.

The expanded Scheme will also allow lenders to offer borrowers a repayment holiday of up to 24  months.

Importantly, the Scheme will also be able to be used by eligible businesses to refinance their existing  loans. This will allow SMEs to access the more concessional interest rates available under the  program and to better manage their cash-flows through an extended loan term and lower combined  repayments.

More than 350,000 current JobKeeper recipients are expected to be eligible under the expanded  Scheme. Loans will be available from 1 April 2021 and must be approved prior to 31 December 2021.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said this latest package of measures was all part of the Federal  Government’s National Economic Recovery Plan.

“We know there are sectors and regions across the country that are continuing to do it tough, which  is why we will continue to support the economy with proportionate, timely, scaleable and targeted  assistance,” the Treasurer said.

“Our support for the aviation sector will not just keep planes in the air but will also provide a boost  to domestic tourism while our international borders remain closed.

“This SME Recovery Scheme is part of the next step in our plan to help small businesses stand on  their own two feet as the economy recovers from COVID-19.

“The expansion and extension of the loans will back businesses that back themselves and will help  businesses who continue to do it tough build a bridge to the other side of the crisis and keep their  staff employed.”

Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Dan Tehan said the Government was also extending  temporary, targeted measures for parts of the tourism sector impacted most from border closures.

“The thing our tourism operators want more than anything is tourists so we need Australians to do  their patriotic duty and book a holiday this year because every dollar spent on an Australian holiday  is a dollar that supports a local job and a local business,” Minister Tehan said.

“Our Government’s support package will help get more Australians into those tourist areas most  impacted by border lockdowns, and we need states and territories to do their part by agreeing to a

nationally consistent approach to using border closures and lockdowns as a last resort on medical  advice.”

The Government has also extended the following programs to 30 September 2021:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the successful Domestic Aviation Network Support (DANS) and Regional Aviation Network  Support (RANS) programs   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the 50 per cent waiver of domestic air services charges for Regular Public Transport (RPT)  and aeromedical flights  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the International Freight Assistance Mechanism.

The $50 million Business Events Grants Program will also be extended by three months to support  Australian businesses to hold multi-day business events, covering up to 50 per cent of costs incurred  in participating business events during the 2021 calendar year. This will help restart Australia’s  business events sector.

The $94.6 million Zoos and Aquarium program will be extended by six months to support zoos,  aquariums and wildlife parks to maintain their animal populations where their tourism revenue has  been affected by travel and social distancing restrictions.

The COVID-19 Consumer Travel Support Program will also be extended for three months beyond 13  March.
