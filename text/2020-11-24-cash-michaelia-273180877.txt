ANNUAL JOBS REPORT POINTS TO COVID-19 REBOUND

Key findings of the 2020 Australian Jobs report show that employment for women and young  people is rebounding strongly from the economic impact of COVID-19.

Launching the annual report today, Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family  Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia Cash, said it was clear that the pandemic has radically  affected Australia’s labour market.

“We know this year has been tough for everyone, but there are promising signs of  employment recovery now beginning to emerge,” Minister Cash said.

“The Australian Jobs report shows us that the labour market has, and is, undergoing  significant changes, and job seekers may need to rethink training and career pathways.”

Australian Jobs is the National Skills Commission’s detailed guide to the Australian labour  market. It includes information about industries and occupations as well as states, territories  and regions. The publication highlights trends in the Australian labour market and provides  guidance about searching for a job and the skills employers value.

“What really stands out in this year’s report is that a large cohort of Australians will likely  need to update or change their skillset to stay competitive in the labour market,” Minister  Cash said.

Australian Jobs can help, providing an easy-to-read overview of industry and occupation  trends in the labour market. It is designed to meet the needs of students, career advisers,  people looking for work and those involved in the national employment service, jobactive.

“This simple to use publication is a powerful tool to help inform what training you might  need as well as where the jobs are going to be, especially as Australia works through the  COVID-19 recovery phase,” Minister Cash said.



Key findings include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Many labour market indicators are now improving since the low in May 2020.  Encouragingly, employment for women and youth, who were initially affected the  most, is rebounding quite strongly.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Health Care and Social Assistance (aged and disability carers, registered nurses, child  carers) is Australia’s largest employing industry and is an area proving to be the most

resilient. Demand is expected to continue for this industry, given the COVID-19  pandemic and Australia’s ageing population. Females comprise 78 per cent of this  workforce.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Post-school study is highly advantageous - data shows that in Health Care and Social  Assistance, more than 80 per cent of employees have a post-school qualification and  carers and aides are the top emerging occupations, with more than 50 per cent of these  workers holding a certificate III or higher VET qualification.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Occupations identified as resilient throughout the pandemic and that are expected to  experience more growth are in groups such as: Professionals (Speech Professionals  and Audiologists, Other Medical Practitioners and Midwives), Community and  Personal Service Workers (Aged and Disabled Carers and Security Officers and  Guards) and Machinery Operators and Drivers (Agricultural, Forestry and  Horticultural Plant Operators and Delivery Drivers).

Australian Jobs 2020 uses data from a range of sources including the Australian Bureau of  Statistics, the National Skills Commission’s own research, the Department of Education,  Skills and Employment and the National Centre for Vocational Education Research.
