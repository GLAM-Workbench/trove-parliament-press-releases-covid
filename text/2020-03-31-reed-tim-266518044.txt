TIM REED INTERVIEW WITH PATRICIA KARVELAS, RN DRIVE

E&OE

Patricia Karvelas, host RN Drive: Business groups, unions and the opposition are all broadly  welcoming the federal government's landmark multibillion-dollar wage subsidy scheme and so are  businesses themselves. More than 200,000 have registered for the $1,500 a fortnight JobKeeper  payment in the last 24 hours. In fact, it's closer to 300,000 now but there are already calls for changes.  Critics argue that casuals who've been with their employer for less than 12 months must also be  included. Tim Reed is the chairman of the Business Council of Australia and was previously the CEO  of MYOB and he joins us on RN Drive. Tim welcome.

Tim Reed, president Business Council of Australia: Patricia, great to be with you.

Patricia: The aim of this scheme is to allow business to keep workers on their book and to keep them  employed, will it do that?

Tim: It will absolutely. In fact, I think the estimates are that about six million employees will be covered  by this and businesses will get the subsidy and be able to ensure that there is an ongoing relationship  that is maintained between them and their employees. Even if there's no work to be done. And we do  have a health crisis and we have to first think of it as a health crisis but the ramifications for some  businesses is that there are no customers coming in the door and therefore there's no revenue coming  in the door. But we need to be in a position as an economy where we can bounce back strongly once  this is over and once the health crisis is dealt with. And what this will enable is for those businesses to  maintain that important relationship between the business and their team members so that when  things do come back they'll be poised and ready to get back to work as quickly as possible.

Patricia: We know a few hundred thousand businesses have registered to get this payment, what  feedback are you getting about the kinds of businesses that are now accessing or trying to access the  payment and the ones that have thought, 'hmm I don't think we can do it?’

Tim: I think it's being used by businesses right across the board. I mean, you mentioned in the intro,  approaching 300,000 businesses in 24 hours. There’s somewhere just over two million operating  businesses in Australia. 50-60 per cent of them are sole employees. So, sort of, owner/contractor type  businesses. By the time you get up to businesses with 20 employees I think you're at about the 98th  percentile of businesses. So overwhelmingly they're going to be small businesses. They're going to be  businesses that are there built to support local communities and businesses that rely on local  communities but contribute back to those local communities. But I fully expect also that there will be  some big businesses in there but no doubt that hospitality industries, tourism, leisure industries, these  industries that we know have had revenue hits of more than 30 per cent. And a business does have to  have revenue drop by 30 per cent before they can apply. Then those businesses will be very heavy  users of this subsidy.

Patricia: So we know that there has to be a 30 per cent downturn for businesses to be able to apply  and of course we will get into the bigger amount for businesses that are over a billion dollars of  turnover.

Tim: Yep.

Patricia: The Australian Industry Group says that 30 per cent figure perhaps should be looked at,  what are your views on that?

Tim: Look 30 per cent is a material downturn in the trading of a business. But if you think about the  way in which a business operates, it does have some flexibility in expenses and also I think we've got  to look at this in the context of the other elements of the package and things that frankly other  businesses are doing. So, utilities that are offering relief on bill payments, banks which are offering six  months holidays on loan repayments and on mortgages frankly, not just on business loans. So there  are other things that are happening out there which will also be going to support these businesses that  have had this downturn in trading. But you know I don't think you would want to see a government  subsidy go to businesses that are actually growing, and there are some sectors that are growing  because of this. So I think you need to draw a line somewhere. I think when you do draw a line it is  very difficult to say precisely that 30 per cent is the right number. But when I saw that my initial take  was somewhere in that 20 to 30 per cent range is probably the right range.

Patricia: And businesses with a turnover of more than a billion dollars a year will have to see a 50 per  cent drop, is that reasonable?

Tim: Yeah look that's I think getting harder. That's a massive downturn in revenue by the time you're  looking at 50 per cent. And one of the things that I really liked about this package is other than that  one element that you just asked me about, it applies to all businesses whatever industry they're in,  however big or small they are. And I think what the package is trying to do is to support jobs. It's trying  to keep Australians working. It's trying to keep Australians in that relationship between the employee  and the employer, which is the relationship that is more than just a salary. You know, it's a relationship  where people gain stability, they gain confidence, it provides an underpinning for people to be able to  go about positive, constructive lives. The government has rightly talked about the mental health  concerns that are coming from this health crisis following into an economic crisis. And by keeping that  employee/employer relationship we are valuing that and trying to lessen the impact on things like  mental health challenges that will come from this. So to draw a different line, to me feels a little  arbitrary but I think it is about Australian jobs and I would rather see that line be consistent for big and  small businesses, but I don't want to say that sounding like I'm taking away from what I think was a  fantastic package. I think it was a very bold move by the government. But a very appropriate move,  one that really brought hope to many people last night.

Patricia: The CEOs of the major banks say GDP could drop by as much as 10 per cent in the March  quarter. We've now seen three major packages. The original one was called a stimulus package but  we're really getting into, sort of, survival or getting people through this crisis now. This is just about  keeping the economy going, keeping people fed. Do you think we're going to need more to actually  keep that GDP from dropping any further?

Tim: One of the things that when I reflect over the last three weeks is just how quickly this has moved  and how quickly our response has moved and how quickly the governments have moved. And again, I  take my hats off to governments of all colours around the nation as coming together and creating a  national government and really in large parts coordinating their efforts and acting swiftly. So I don't  think anyone would want to say we draw a line under things at this moment in time and nothing else  will be needed and nothing else will be done. But what I will say is this is a very, very significant move.  I hope and I believe, I've got every confidence based on the behaviours that I've seen over the past  month that the government is very much in tune to what's happening in the community and very much  in tune to reviving things if they realise that they have got something slightly out of place with some of  the policies that they've put in. And also adding to it where necessary. And so I don't think anyone  would want to at this point be ruling a line under things and saying no more.

Patricia: A billionaire, John Van Lieshout, has told many of his commercial tenants they'll have to  keep paying rent even though he owns the properties outright, is that lacking in empathy?

Tim: Look I think that every individual circumstance needs to be looked at and that's not one that I  have any particular knowledge as to. But what we have seen the government engaging with large  landlords, certainly know those that are members of the BCA, proactively and constructively in  conversations about what rent relief might look like and how to balance the complexity of the  requirements for the retailer but also the requirements for the landlords who may well have a  considerable amount of debt on their property. I don't have any knowledge of that specific incident or  circumstance that you have referred to though Patricia.

Patricia: Just on another issue before I let you go, Virgin has asked the federal government for a $1.4  billion dollar loan to stay afloat and Qantas say if Virgin gets a bailout they should get one too. Should  the government be open to that?

Tim: Look I think it is really important that in making decisions that we think about what happens after  this. There is a health crisis flowed into an economic crisis because it changed the way in which we  behave. But that health crisis will pass us and there is hope on the other end. We are a strong nation,  we went into this in a strong position and we will come out strongly. What we really want to do is make  sure that the policies that are put in place set us up to come out as quickly as we possibly can and as  strongly as we possibly can. Now different industries have been hit in different ways. Broadly speaking  I think programs like the wage subsidy that was announced yesterday is the best thing to do because  it applies across all industries and to businesses big and small. But there are some sectors that have  been hit particularly hard and certainly, aviation is one of them. So I don't think it's inappropriate for the  government to consider an aviation package because at the end of this aviation is a critical part of the  infrastructure in our nation. We need it to keep our supply chains open, we need it to make sure that  workers get to remote mines, we need it to link our regional communities with our cities, and us with  the rest of the world. And so I think there is good reason for the government to consider an aviation  package.

Patricia: Tim thanks for your time.

Tim: My pleasure.

Patricia: Tim Reed there, he's the chairman of the Business Council of Australia and this is RN Drive.
