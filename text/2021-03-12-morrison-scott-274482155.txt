Quad Leaders’ Joint Statement: “The Spirit of the Quad”

1. We haveÃ¢ÂÂ¯convened to reaffirm our commitment to quadrilateral cooperation between Australia,  India, Japan, and the United States.Ã¢ÂÂ¯We bring diverseÃ¢ÂÂ¯perspectives and are united in a shared vision  for the free and open Indo-Pacific.Ã¢ÂÂ¯We strive for a region that is free, open, inclusive, healthy,  anchored by democraticÃ¢ÂÂ¯values, and unconstrained by coercion.Ã¢ÂÂ¯We recall that  ourÃ¢ÂÂ¯jointÃ¢ÂÂ¯effortsÃ¢ÂÂ¯towardÃ¢ÂÂ¯this positive vision arose out of an internationalÃ¢ÂÂ¯tragedy,Ã¢ÂÂ¯the tsunami of  2004.Ã¢ÂÂ¯Today,Ã¢ÂÂ¯the global devastation wrought by COVID-19, the threat of climate change,Ã¢ÂÂ¯and security  challenges facing the region summon us with renewed purpose.Ã¢ÂÂ¯On this historic occasion of March  12, 2021, the first-ever leader-level summitÃ¢ÂÂ¯of the Quad, we pledge to strengthen our cooperation  on the defining challenges of our time.

2. Together, weÃ¢ÂÂ¯commit to promotingÃ¢ÂÂ¯a free, openÃ¢ÂÂ¯rules-based order, rooted inÃ¢ÂÂ¯international law to  advanceÃ¢ÂÂ¯security and prosperity and counter threats to bothÃ¢ÂÂ¯in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.Ã¢ÂÂ¯We  support the rule of law, freedom of navigation and overflight, peaceful resolution of disputes,  democratic values, and territorial integrity. We commit to work together and with a range of  partners. We reaffirm our strong support for ASEAN’s unity and centrality as well as the ASEAN  Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. Full of potential, the Quad looks forward to the future; it seeks  to uphold peace and prosperity and strengthen democratic resilience, based on universal values.

3. Our common goals require us to reckon with the most urgent of global challenges. Today, we  pledge to respond to the economic and health impacts of COVID-19, combat climate change, and  address shared challenges, including in cyber space, critical technologies, counterterrorism, quality  infrastructure investment, and humanitarian-assistance and disaster-relief as well as maritime  domains.

4. Building on the progress our countries have achieved on health security, we will join forces to  expand safe, affordable, and effective vaccine production and equitable access, to speed economic  recovery and benefit global health. With steadfast commitment to the health and safety of our own  people, we also recognize that none of us can be safe as long as the pandemic continues to spread.  We will, therefore, collaborate to strengthen equitable vaccine access for the Indo-Pacific, with close  coordination with multilateral organizations including the World Health Organization and COVAX.  We call for transparent and results-oriented reform at the World Health Organization. We are united  in recognizing that climate change is a global priority and will work to strengthen the climate actions  of all nations, including to keep a Paris-aligned temperature limit within reach. We look forward to a  successful COP 26 in Glasgow. We will begin cooperation on the critical technologies of the future to  ensure that innovation is consistent with a free, open, inclusive, and resilient Indo-Pacific. We will  continue to prioritize the role of international law in the maritime domain, particularly as reflected  in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and facilitate collaboration,  including in maritime security, to meet challenges to the rules-based maritime order in the East and  South China Seas. We reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of North Korea in  accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions, and also confirm the necessity of  immediate resolution of the issue of Japanese abductees. As long-standing supporters of Myanmar  and its people, we emphasize the urgent need to restore democracy and the priority of  strengthening democratic resilience.

5. To advance these goalsÃ¢ÂÂ¯and others,Ã¢ÂÂ¯weÃ¢ÂÂ¯will redouble our commitment to Quad  engagement.Ã¢ÂÂ¯WeÃ¢ÂÂ¯will combine our nations’ medical, scientific, financing, manufacturing and  delivery, and development capabilities and establish a vaccine expert working group to implement  our path-breaking commitment to safe and effective vaccine distribution; we will launch a critical-  and emerging-technology working group to facilitate cooperation on international standards and  innovative technologies of the future; and we will establish a climate working group to strengthen

climate actions globally on mitigation, adaptation, resilience, technology, capacity-building, and  climate finance. Our experts and senior officials will continue to meet regularly;  our Foreign Ministers will converse often and meet at least once a year. At the leader level, weÃ¢ÂÂ¯will  holdÃ¢ÂÂ¯anÃ¢ÂÂ¯in-personÃ¢ÂÂ¯summitÃ¢ÂÂ¯by the end of 2021.Ã¢ÂÂ¯The ambition of these engagements is fit to the  moment; we are committed to leveraging our partnership to help the world’s most dynamic region  respond to historic crisis, so that it may be the free, open, accessible, diverse, and thriving Indo-Pacific we all seek.

Quad Summit Fact Sheet   March 12, 2021

The Quad Vaccine Partnership   While ensuring that vaccines have been made available to our people, “Quad” partners  will launch a landmark partnership to further accelerate the end of the COVID-19  pandemic. Together, Quad leaders are taking shared action necessary to expand safe  and effective COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing in 2021, and will work together to  strengthen and assist countries in the Indo-Pacific with vaccination, in close  coordination with the existing relevant multilateral mechanisms including WHO and  COVAX.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Drawing on each of our strengths, we will tackle this complex issue with multi-sectoral cooperation across many stages of action, starting with ensuring global  availability of safe and effective vaccines.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Quad partners are working collaboratively to achieve expanded manufacturing of  safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines at facilities in India, prioritizing increased  capacity for vaccines authorized by Stringent Regulatory Authorities (SRA).   Quad partners will address financing and logistical demands for production,  procurement, and delivery of safe and effective vaccines. Quad partners will work  to use our shared tools and expertise, through mechanisms at institutions  including the United States Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Japan  International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and, as appropriate, Japan Bank of  International Cooperation (JBIC), as well as others.

o The United States, through the DFC, will work with Biological E Ltd., to  finance increased capacity to support Biological E's effort to produce at  least 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of  2022 with Stringent Regulatory Authorization (SRA) and/or World Health  Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Listing (EUL), including the  Johnson & Johnson vaccine.   o Japan, through JICA, is in discussions to provide concessional yen loans

for the Government of India to expand manufacturing for COVID-19  vaccines for export, with a priority on producing vaccines that have  received authorization from WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) or  Stringent Regulatory Authorities.   o Quad partners will ensure expanded manufacturing will be exported for

global benefit, to be procured through key multilateral initiatives, such as  COVAX, that provide life-saving vaccines for low-income countries, and by  countries in need.  o Quad partners will also cooperate to strengthen “last-mile” vaccination,  building on existing health-security and development programs, and  across our governments to coordinate and strengthen our programs in the  Indo-Pacific.

Ã¯ÂÂ¼ This includes supporting countries with vaccine readiness and  delivery, vaccine procurement, health workforce preparedness,  responses to vaccine misinformation, community engagement,  immunization capacity, and more.



Ã¯ÂÂ¼ Australia will contribute US$77 million for the provision of vaccines  and “last-mile” delivery support with a focus on Southeast Asia, in  addition to its existing commitment of US$407 million for regional  vaccine access and health security which will provide full vaccine  coverage to nine Pacific Island countries and Timor-Leste, and  support procurement, prepare for vaccine delivery, and strengthen  health systems in Southeast Asia.

Ã¯ÂÂ¼ Japan will assist vaccination programs of developing countries such  as the purchase of vaccines and cold-chain support including through  provision of grant aid of $41 million and new concessional yen loans,  ensuring alignment with and support of COVAX.

Ã¯ÂÂ¼ The United States will leverage existing programs to further boost  vaccination capability, drawing on at least $100 million in regional  efforts focused on immunization.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Our commitment will be implemented by the launch of aÃ¢ÂÂ¯senior-level Quad

Vaccine Experts Group, comprised ofÃ¢ÂÂ¯top scientists and officialsÃ¢ÂÂ¯from our  governments. This group will support Quad cooperation in the long term, and  use science and evidence to: Ã¢ÂÂ¯Ã¢ÂÂ¯   o design an implementation plan for the Quad COVID-19 vaccine effort;Ã¢ÂÂ¯Ã¢ÂÂ¯   o identify hurdles impeding vaccine administration in the region;Ã¢ÂÂ¯Ã¢ÂÂ¯   o work with financers and production facilities toÃ¢ÂÂ¯monitorÃ¢ÂÂ¯timely and

sufficient capacity expansion that will lead to wider distribution of safe  and effective vaccines;Ã¢ÂÂ¯Ã¢ÂÂ¯   o share governmentalÃ¢ÂÂ¯plans to support Indo-Pacific health  security and COVID-19 response, and identifyÃ¢ÂÂ¯practical

cooperationÃ¢ÂÂ¯onÃ¢ÂÂ¯“last-mile”Ã¢ÂÂ¯delivery for hard-to-reach communities in  need;Ã¢ÂÂ¯Ã¢ÂÂ¯   o strengthen and support the life-saving work ofÃ¢ÂÂ¯international organizations,  includingÃ¢ÂÂ¯the WHO,Ã¢ÂÂ¯COVAX,Ã¢ÂÂ¯Gavi, CEPI, UNICEF,Ã¢ÂÂ¯the G7, ASEAN, and

governments, and call on other countries to do the same;Ã¢ÂÂ¯Ã¢ÂÂ¯   Ã¯ÂÂ§ make additional concrete recommendations before the end  of the year.Ã¢ÂÂ¯Ã¢ÂÂ¯

The Quad Climate Working Group   We have identified the climate challenge as a priority for the Quad and the Indo-Pacific  region. We will establish a new Quad Climate Working Group focused on:    Ã¯ÂÂ· Cooperation, both among ourselves and with other countries, to strengthen

implementation of the Paris Agreement, including to keep a Paris-aligned  temperature limit within reach;  Ã¯ÂÂ· Working together and with other countries to support, strengthen, and enhance  actions globally;  Ã¯ÂÂ· Committing to advancing low-emissions technology solutions to support

emissions reduction;   Ã¯ÂÂ· Cooperation on climate mitigation, adaptation, resilience, technology, capacity-building, and climate finance.



The Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group    Quad leaders recognize that a free, open, inclusive, and resilient Indo-Pacific requires  that critical and emerging technology is governed and operates according to shared  interests and values. In that spirit, we will convene a Critical and Emerging Technology  Working Group, which will:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Develop a statement of principles on technology design, development, and use;   Ã¯ÂÂ· Facilitate coordination on technology standards development, including between  our national technology standards bodies and working with a broad range of  partners;

Ã¯ÂÂ· Encourage cooperation on telecommunications deployment, diversification of  equipment suppliers, and future telecommunications, including through close  cooperation with our private sectors and industry;

Ã¯ÂÂ· Facilitate cooperation to monitor trends and opportunities related to  developments in critical and emerging technology, including biotechnology;    Ã¯ÂÂ· Convene dialogues on critical technology supply chains.
