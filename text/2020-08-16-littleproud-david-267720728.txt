Uni of Tasmania’s hort traceability app to bear fruit

Ã¯ÂÂ· The University of Tasmania is developing a cloud-based application focussed on  traceability of Australian fruit marketed in China.  Ã¯ÂÂ· The Australian Government is supporting the project with $455,000 Traceability  Grants Program funding.

The University of Tasmania has been awarded $455,000 to develop a new digital solution  that will help promote and improve the traceability of exported Australian fruit.

Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management David Littleproud said the  funding was part of the Australian Government’s $7 million Traceability Grants Program.

“This is yet another example of innovation that reinforces and promotes Australia’s  reputation as a producer of clean, green and safe food.

“The cloud-based technology will allow easy tracing of Australian produce along the supply  chain, making it simpler to extract information that supports its authenticity and  compliance.

“The app will also include a function that will further support the digital promotion of  Australian fruit and vegetables overseas.

“Modern, accurate, and timely traceability systems assure our trading partners and  consumers that our fantastic produce is of the highest quality and safety standards.

“To ensure a digital solution that is fit for purpose, horticultural supply chain partners will  be actively involved in the design process.

“The system will also be built to ensure it can be adapted to other Australian fresh produce  supply chains with minimal modification.

“Key importers from Shanghai markets have already expressed enthusiasm for the market  advantage a digital promotion app will provide.

“As we respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s more important than ever to ensure  farmers can put their best foot forward and effectively market the quality of their  outstanding produce.”
