JOINT MEDIA RELEASE

Thursday 18th March 2021

Further funding released to support community  bushfire recovery projects  Bushfire affected communities in Victoria can now apply for a further $14.6 million to help  with their recovery with the second round of Local Economic Recovery community grants  program now open.

Announcing the second stage of Local Community Project Grants today, Australian  Minister for Emergency Management David Littleproud and Victorian Acting Minister for  Police and Emergency Services Danny Pearson encouraged organisations to apply for  funding.

Under the LER Local Community Project Grants, $14.6 million is available for grants of up  to $2 million to fund projects that support local economic recovery and build a sense of  community pride and connectedness.

“This funding allows councils, community members and local business groups to shape  the long-term recovery of Victoria’s bushfire-affected regions,” Minister Littleproud said.

“Communities have suffered due to drought, bushfire and COVID, and the Local Economic  Recovery program is about creating jobs, backing businesses, and supporting  communities to become more resilient to disasters in the future,” he said.

Applications can be made by a range of organisations, including not-for-profits, local  government and private businesses, Acting Minister Pearson said.

“These grants are supporting those smaller, local-level projects in communities that can  really enhance tourism and business while also restoring that sense of community  connectedness and pride that is so important to recovery,” Mr Pearson said.

“We are working at the pace of community. Some communities are recovering at a different  pace than others and that’s why we have taken this phased approach to providing funding  for community priorities.”
