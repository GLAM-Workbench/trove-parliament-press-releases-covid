Safety upgrade to complement Toowoomba second range crossing

Minister for Transport and Main Roads  The Honourable Mark Bailey

Works have started on the $4 million Murphys Creek Road and Brookside Place intersection upgrade at Postmans Ridge, bolstering freight movement through the Lockyer Valley and Toowoomba.

The upgrade will realign the intersection to favour the B-double route, add a dedicated right-turn lane into Brookside Place and improve sight distance.

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development Michael McCormack said this upgrade will complement the completed $1.6 billion Toowoomba Second Range Crossing which was all about keeping people safe on Australia’s roads while making key freight routes more efficient, delivering long-term benefits to drivers, businesses and local communities.

“This is just the latest example of the funding flowing under our record $110 billion infrastructure plan, with the continued roll-out of road infrastructure projects supporting local jobs, underpinning economic growth and making sure all Australians can reach their destinations sooner and safer,” the Deputy Prime Minister said.

Queensland Minister for Transport and Main Roads Mark Bailey said continuing to invest in better freight connectivity in the region was crucial to supporting jobs in the region and helping its $13.86 billion economy to recover and grow into the future.

“Truck drivers played a critical role in keeping Queensland’s economy moving through COVID-19 - keeping our supermarket shelves stocked and world-class products moving,” Mr Bailey said.

“The efforts of truck drivers and Queenslanders as a whole to help manage the health impacts of the global virus has meant we’ve been able to get on with creating jobs in construction through projects like the $10 million James Street culvert upgrades and now this upgrade at Postmans Ridge.”

The Toowoomba Second Range Crossing cut across the old Postmans Ridge Road, which created the cul-de-sac known as Brookside Place.

Westbound Murphys Creek Road traffic will no longer have to give way, which will improve efficiency for both residents and freight operators.

Queensland Assistant Minister for Regional Roads Bruce Saunders said as the link between the Warrego Highway, New England Highway and Murphys Creek Road would provide an alternative route for heavy vehicles if there were any Toowoomba Range closures.

“Better roads get our truck drivers home safer, our products to markets across Australia and the globe and stimulate jobs, which is why we’ve also injected another $1 billion in joint stimulus funding since April to upgrade roads right across the region and the state,” Mr Saunders said.

Federal Member for Wright Scott Buchholz said the works were important in keeping locals in jobs.

“We are all about building a stronger and more resilient Australia, boosting the economy and meeting the national freight challenge,” Mr Buchholz said.

“The project will help get Australians back to work and back in business following the impacts of COVID-19.

“It’s important we roll up our sleeves and ensure a bright future for this region through projects like this.”

Works are expected to be complete by late April 2021, weather and construction conditions permitting.

There will be traffic impacts during this time with a potential temporary closure of the intersection, detouring westbound traffic via Postmans Ridge Road.

Crews will generally undertake works Monday to Saturday, between 6am and 6pm.

This project is part of the jointly funded $1.6 billion Toowoomba Second Range Crossing project, for which the Australian Government committed $1.14 billion and the Queensland Government $463 million.
