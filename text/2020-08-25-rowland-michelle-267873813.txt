MICHELLE ROWLAND MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS  MEMBER FOR GREENWAY



DISALLOWANCE OF AUSTRALIA POST REGULATIONS

Labor is disappointed Scott Morrisonâ€™s cuts to Australia Post services were last night  permitted by the Senate.

Since these regulations were announced, the Government has hopped from one false  claim to another to justify their pre-planned cuts.

At each step, they have been called out and their incompetence exposed.

Labor and the unions have been successful in securing the jobs and wages of postal  workers, but we remain disappointed that COVID-19 has been used as cover to bypass  consultation, implement a pre-existing agenda, and degrade services.

Labor will continue to stand up for workers and community services, and hold this  Government to account.
