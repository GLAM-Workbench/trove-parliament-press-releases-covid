AM Agenda with Laura Jayes, Sky News  Topics: Vaccine rollout.

E & OE…

Laura Jayes:

Aged care residents and workers are among the first Australians to be vaccinated against  coronavirus this week - 240 aged care centres in more than 190 locations across the country  will roll out the Pfizer vaccine. This is in an attempt to protect some of the most vulnerable in  the community. But it won't be compulsory, after the peak health committee decided against  it to avoid backlash. Richard Colbeck is the Minister for Aged Care Services. He joins me  now.

Richard, thanks so much for your time.

Richard Colbeck:

[Talks over] Hi, Laura.

Laura Jayes:

Why did the AHPPC decide against making this compulsory?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, it was based on the information that was available to the AHPPC at the time, and there  remains a question as to whether the vaccine effectively prevents transmission of the virus,  and that would be the reason that you would make it compulsory. There is more information  starting to come through and the AHPPC have said that they will keep this matter open and  make a decision if that's what the information- the medical advice and information shows - so  it remains an open matter. But at the point in time when the AHPPC met, considered that

particular issue, the question remained, at that point, and still remains as to how effective the  vaccine was at preventing transmission. And that is why it’s [indistinct]…

Laura Jayes:

[Interrupts] There’s some evidence out of Israel, just in the last couple of days - and I know  it's not concrete evidence and it hasn't been published yet - that the Pfizer vaccine is more  effective than stopping transmission. Now, is part of that the reason why the Pfizer vaccine is  being rolled out to aged care? Or will it be a mix?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, the reason we're using the Pfizer vaccine is because that's the one we have first. And  these people are our priority - the frontline workers that we've been talking about, the  residents in residential aged care and disability care, and also the workers that support them.  They are the highest priority. We have the access to the Pfizer vaccine first, that's why we're  rolling it out to them first. The majority of aged care residents will get the Pfizer vaccine, and  workers and frontline workers. But there may be some, depending on circumstances, that do  access the AstraZeneca vaccine. And we must remember that, at this point in time, the whole  focus is protecting senior Australians, Australians more broadly, and both vaccines are very  effective at that.

Laura Jayes:

If aged care workers decide not to get this vaccine, will they still be able to give face to face  care in aged care homes?

Richard Colbeck:

Well again, that will come down to the health advice from the AHPPC, that's why we're  prioritising the rollout this week to the residents. They are the ones who are most vulnerable,  and so giving them the vaccine and commencing that process of providing protection to them  is very, very important. And if we continue to get strong uptake - which is what the  indications that I've seen so far are from the providers that have given some indication -  strong levels of interest and desire to have the vaccine, that protects the residents against  serious illness and disease, and that's the most important thing for us at this point in time.

Laura Jayes:

Is there no health advice to date so far about that face to face care? And whether that stops,  whether you’re vaccinated or not?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, we have a range of precautions in place within residential aged care facilities already,  particularly in circumstances where there's community transmission of the vaccine. But all of  the things that we've been practising for the last year - hand hygiene, sneezing into your  elbow, maintaining a social distance - all of those things should be maintained while we learn

more about how, what the effects of the vaccine is, how it works, and it's strengthen in- with  respect to preventing transmission. So we need to maintain all of those disciplines.

Maintaining our focus on infection control within aged care facilities is something that we  will continue to do - it's a strong focus. We're working with the states on that as well to  maintain that level, to strengthen the training within residential aged care facilities around  infection control. We've learnt how very important it is for COVID, but it also has impacts  for other things like gastro and the flu. And so, maintaining that discipline, I think, is going to  be something that’s- will be a continuing feature of the delivery of aged care.

Laura Jayes:

What do you expect the uptake to be amongst staff in aged care centres?

Richard Colbeck:

Look, I’m hoping that it’s high, and that’s the indications that we’re seeing so far - not just in  aged care, but I think that there’s a great anticipation in the community. Today’s a really  important day, that we start vaccinating, that we start protecting those that are the most  vulnerable. But as we gain access to more supplies of the vaccine [audio skip] we can expand  the roll out to other groups within the community, protect ourselves, hopefully protect against  community transmission and get back to a more normal form of lifestyle.

Laura Jayes:

But, Minister, is there a goal in mind for staff at aged care centres? Is it 100 per cent? Is it 95  per cent? What’s the goal?

Richard Colbeck:

Look, I would urge every person who works in a residential [audio skip] to take up the  vaccine. The AHPPC will continue will continue to monitor the information that comes back  to us from other jurisdictions. You’ve mentioned Israel, but we’re also talking to our  colleagues in the UK about what they’re seeing with respect to transmission. And if it is the  circumstance that a strong uptake, or a strong level of vaccination will prevent transmission,  the AHPPC will reconsider its decision with respect to compulsory vaccination or otherwise,  in the similar way that we’ve done with the flu.

Laura Jayes:

Okay. And that uptake is relatively high. The million-dollar question, I might say Minister, is  what happens after this vaccine roll out is completed in aged care centres, when- a, when will  that be complete? And does it mean that we can visit our grandparents as much as we want?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, we’re aiming to get through the first round of vaccinations within six weeks, and we  know that the Ast- the Pfizer vaccine provides a level of protection pretty quickly after the

dose is administered - so that’s great news. We want to be able to have the operation of our  aged care facilities coming back to normal as quickly as possible, and I know that’s one of  the aspirations that residents in aged care are already talking about. They want to be able to  go back out for little trips, opportunities to get out, have friends and visitors come back in and  see them - so, they’re all looking forward to that. And so, the roll out of the vaccine is a  serious enabler for that, and as we work our way through the community that will become  more possible.

Laura Jayes:

So, just to be very clear on that - if you’re vaccinated, if you live in an aged care home, will  you be able to go outside and go on those excursions as you’ve explained?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, that’s what the residents are looking forward to being able to do. At this point in time,  based on what we know about the vaccine, it protects the person who’s been vaccinated.  We’re watching very, very closely the issues around what it does with respect to  transmission. And as we learn more about that, I think that will be one of the things that  opens up the opportunities for people to move more freely.

Laura Jayes:

Okay. So, not quite yet. You need more evidence. Is that what you're saying?

Richard Colbeck:

Look, I think we do. We're very, very early in the in the process here in Australia at the  moment, and as you've said, we're only just starting to see some evidence coming from other  jurisdictions with respect to what it does in relation to transmission. And the thing that we  really need to keep at the front of our mind is we need to protect these older Australians who  are in residential aged care facilities, because they are the most vulnerable people in the  country.

Laura Jayes:

Now, I know you caught a bit of a glimpse of Jane then. We were lucky enough to have her  on the programme. She said she didn't recognise the Prime Minister, she apologised to him  very publicly this morning. But she's urging everyone to go out and get the vaccine. She  seems to be a bit of an influence, Richard Colbeck. I've just got a message here from one of  our wonderful viewers, Rod. He said: she's a wonderful Australian. Such an inspiration. I'm  68. Was a bit apprehensive about the vaccine but now, after watching the interview this  morning, I'll definitely go and get it. She seems like someone you need on your books.

Richard Colbeck:

Look, she was fantastic. I have to say, I really did have a smile. She's learnt a bit about the  direction of her hand signals, which is great. But the important thing that she said this

morning was that, you know, no side effects for her and I know that that's been something  that people have been concerned about. We know that the vaccine will protect her now that  she's had it and she's having no side effects. She looked really sprightly this morning. It was  great to see her in such good form, and the fact that she was looking forward to catching up  with her friends as well. So- really pleased to have had- to see her yesterday get the jab, and  be in great nick today.

Laura Jayes:

Yeah, absolutely. Richard Colbeck, thanks so much for your time.

Richard Colbeck:

Thanks Laura.
