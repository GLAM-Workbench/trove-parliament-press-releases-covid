South Australia doing the hard work to secure   their agricultural workforce

Ã¯ÂÂ· Government commends South Australia’s agricultural workforce supply efforts  Ã¯ÂÂ· State to establish regional quarantine facility ahead of citrus harvest  Ã¯ÂÂ· Value of SA agriculture $6.78 billion, citrus production more than $277 million

Agriculture Minister David Littleproud has praised South Australia’s leadership in exploring  and approving quarantine options for seasonal workers.

“When it comes to filling critical worker shortages in agriculture, the Marshall Government  is showing the other states and territories how it’s done,” Minister Littleproud said.

“The Australian Government welcomes South Australia’s announcement this week that it’s  setting up a speciality regional quarantine facility in time for the lucrative citrus harvest.

“The facility at Paringa will cater specifically for workers arriving under the Commonwealth  Seasonal Worker Programme and Pacific Labour Scheme, with new arrivals expected  every 14 days over the next three months.

“This comes just days after they agreed to opt in on our National Cabinet-endorsed plan  for an in-country quarantine pilot for Pacific workers.

“This pilot will allow nations such as Vanuatu and Fiji, who already run quarantine  programs, to pre-screen participants in the Seasonal Worker Programme and Pacific  Labour Scheme.

“I commend South Australia for their proactivity and willingness to work constructively with  the Australian Government in ensuring our farmers have access to the workforce they  need.

“South Australian citrus is worth hundreds of millions to the state’s economy, but labour is  scarce due to COVID-19 travel restrictions on international movement.

“Our farmers and regions have been long calling for a common sense and practical  solutions to securing workforce supply, but this will require all states and territories coming  on board.

“It shows that the states finger pointing is just a front for their failure to act.”
