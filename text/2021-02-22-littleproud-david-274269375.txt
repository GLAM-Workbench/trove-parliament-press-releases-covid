$14 MILLION REPAIR OF FLOOD DAMAGED

GLADSTONE-MONTO ROAD COMPLETE   Works to repair nine floodways along the Gladstone-Monto Road, a key freight transport link for the  Boyne Valley community, have been completed.

Federal Minister for Emergency Management David Littleproud said the $14 million flood  restoration project demonstrates that the Australian Government is committed to delivering the  critical infrastructure needed to help communities get back on their feet.

“Natural disasters have repeatedly impacted the local community over the past three years, and  the completion of this project is a positive and welcome achievement,” Minister Littleproud said.

"Gladstone-Monto Road is an important connector for local communities and industry alike, given  its role as a key freight transport link and heavy vehicle route servicing the resource and agriculture  sectors.

"This project has delivered safe and reliable road access that will also support ongoing economic  growth and expansion across Central Queensland.

“In addition to repairing flood damage along this route, the project will provide support  Queensland’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Queensland Transport and Main Roads Minister Mark Bailey said the project had provided an  immediate economic boost through securing jobs at a critical time.

"Importantly, this project safeguarded regional jobs as it was delivered by a Queensland company,  providing much-needed support to local families and businesses," Minister Bailey said.

"Works included replacing concrete floodways, installing rock batter protection and correcting the  floodway approaches."

Minister Bailey said as well as repairing the flood damage, complementary funding of $4 million  had been secured to make the infrastructure more resilient to future disasters.

"To provide value for money for the community and minimise disruptions, the reconstruction works  were packaged together with additional activities to upgrade the road and improve its flood  resilience," he said.

"The additional works were funded under the Queensland Transport and Roads Investment  Program and included building foamed bitumen pavement on the floodway approaches and  widening all nine floodways.

"Some of the floodways were also lengthened, with additional rock protection installed at several  locations and protective treatments installed on selected approaches.

"These improvements will increase flows and enable water to clear the floodways more quickly  during floods, enhancing the route's resilience.”

Eligible reconstruction works are jointly funded by the Australian and Queensland governments  under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA).
