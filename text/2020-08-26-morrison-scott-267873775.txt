Pandemic leave disaster payment for Tasmania

Tasmanian workers are now eligible for a $1,500 Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment if they cannot work because  they need to self-isolate or quarantine.

The Australian Government has extended Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment arrangements to include Tasmania  following agreement with the Tasmanian Government.

It is a lump sum payment to help workers during their 14 day self-isolation period and applies from 22 August  2020.

If an individual is instructed by a health official to stay home from work, and has used up all their sick leave  entitlements, including any special pandemic leave, they may be eligible to make a claim. People may also be  eligible if they’re the parent or guardian of a child aged 16 or under who is a close contact or has tested positive  for COVID-19.

Tasmanians workers are eligible for the payment if they are not receiving income, earnings or salary  maintenance from work, receiving the JobKeeper Payment or other forms of Australian Government income  support. The payment can be claimed again should an extended quarantine period longer than 14 days be  instructed by health officials.

To date in Victoria more than $8.8 million has been paid for almost 6,000 granted claims since 6 August.

The fastest and easiest way to make a claim is over the phone by calling 180 22 66. Please do not visit a service  centre. Further information is available at http://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/disaster.
