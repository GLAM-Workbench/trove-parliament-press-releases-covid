MORRISON MUST ACT URGENTLY ON PRIVATE ICU BEDS

The Morrison Government must act urgently to save one-third of Australia's  intensive care unit (ICU) capacity.

One in three Australian ICU beds are in private hospitals. These beds and the  doctors and nurses that staff them will be essential in Australia's fight against  COVID-19.

But private hospitals are now warning that the lack of a national plan for  COVID-19 services will force them to lay off staff, and even shut their doors,  within days.

This follows the Government's botched implementation of an elective surgery  shutdown - which was announced without consultation with hospitals or  surgeons, and then pushed back a week.

The decision to delay non-urgent elective surgery is the right one. But this is yet  another measure that has been undermined by a lack of clarity from the  Government.

With non-urgent elective surgery now due to end next week, private hospitals  need support to maintain staff until the COVID-19 peak, and a clear plan for  their role when it hits.

Despite their best efforts today, Scott Morrison and Greg Hunt can't blame  hospitals or states for this mess. The Commonwealth is responsible for private  health, and national leadership is needed now more than ever.

Scott Morrison and Greg Hunt must step up - today - and announce how they  are going to save one-third of Australia's ICU beds.
