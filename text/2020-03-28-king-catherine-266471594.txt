SHADOW MINISTER FOR INFRASTRUCTURE, TRANSPORT AND

REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT

MEMBER FOR BALLARAT



SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL AVIATION WELCOMED, BUT WORKERS

MUST BE INCLUDED



Shadow Transport Minister Catherine King welcomed the Federal

Government‘s regional aviation support package but called on the Government

and industry to ensure workers are supported through this crisis.



The package will assist regional airlines on a case-by-case basis that are facing

urgent cash flow issues resulting from suppressed demand and increased

travel restrictions from the Coronavirus outbreak.



It will also support continuity of service for 138 regional communities that rely

on aviation for critical medical supplies, specialist visits and critical freight.



Last week, Labor welcomed the Government’s first aviation package but noted

it was not going to be enough.



The first package also did not include any guarantees airlines would retain and

support workers through this crisis.



Tens of thousands of workers across our aviation industry have been stood



down in the last week, and many have no guarantee a job is waiting for them

when the crisis is over.



It is essential that we keep as many Australians connected to the labour market

and to their employer as possible.



In working with regional airlines on individual support measures, the

Government must include wage subsidies that ensure workers remain

connected to their employer.



If the Government fails to ensure workers are supported to remain connected to

business through this crisis, it will take airlines and our aviation industry longer

to scale up once the outbreak passes.



Labor will review the regional aviation package and continue to play a

constructive, responsible and supportive role through this outbreak, including

injecting a sense of urgency where it is absent.
