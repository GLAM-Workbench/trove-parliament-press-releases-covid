LIGHTS ARE ON BUT NO ONE’S HOME

Today in Senate Estimates it was revealed the Morrison Government doesn’t know:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If homelessness is going to go up in the next twelve months,   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ What will happen to the 7000 homeless Australians put into empty hotel rooms  during the pandemic,   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ How many people applied to have their rent cut or deferred during the moratorium

on evictions, or   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ How many Australians have accessed homelessness services throughout the  pandemic.  Here are some of the non-answers from today’s Estimates:

Q: What modelling has the Department done to assess the likely increased demand  for homelessness services because of job losses resulting from the current  recession and cuts to income support?

A: “The Federal Government does not have as much information about the details of  homelessness and social housing activities in the states for us to get a clear  understanding.”

Anne Ruston, Minister for Families and Social Services

Q: Has the Government collected any data on the success or otherwise of National  Cabinet’s eviction moratorium?

A: “I’m unable to assist.”

Kathryn Campbell, Secretary for the Department of Social Services.

Q: What update can the Department provide on the number of people provided with  temporary hotel accommodation during the COVID crisis?

A: “We would certainly love that information.”

Anne Ruston, Minister for Families and Social Services





These are basic facts the Government should know.

Putting a roof over the head of Australians in the middle of a pandemic should be the most  basic thing the Government is focussed on.

This proves they’re not.
