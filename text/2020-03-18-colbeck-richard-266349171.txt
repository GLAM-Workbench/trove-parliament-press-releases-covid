COVID-19 community sport guidelines issued to national sporting organisations

The Australian Government has announced new community sport guidelines to combat the spread of  COVID-19.

This follows ongoing consultation with sporting organisations and is focused on providing relevant advice  on change room access, physical contact, travel, and social distancing and hygiene practices.

These guidelines were developed by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC),  comprising all state and territory Chief Health Officers and is chaired by the Australian Chief Medical  Officer, Professor Brendan Murphy.

The guidelines were subsequently endorsed by the newly formed National Cabinet which is made up of all  Premiers, First Ministers and the Prime Minister.



AHPPC COVID-19 Community Sport Guidelines

All community sport participants must play a role to help reduce the transmission of COVID 19, including  those organising, attending or supporting attendance at these activities.

Participants should not attend and participate in Community Sport if they:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Have travelled internationally or been exposed to a person with COVID-19 in the preceding 14 days;  or  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Are at a high risk including the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions.

Attendance at Community Sport activities

Only essential participants should attend activities, i.e. players, coaches, match officials, staff and volunteers  involved in operations and parents/guardians of participants;

All players, visitors should practise the following social distancing measures at Community Sporting  activities:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Players, visitors and officials should minimise physical contact as much as is practicable, for  example no shaking hands, no walking out with player mascots, no pre- or post-match celebrations  and no celebrating between players during the match.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ When spectating or attending a game or training session, ensure a distance of 1.5 metres is kept  between yourself and others;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Access to change rooms should be restricted solely to players, officials and essential staff;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If spectating, try to maintain 1.5 metres between yourself and others.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It is recommended that sporting teams, including school sporting teams, maintain local competitions  only, with no inter-district, or inter-club travel. As with all gatherings, basic protective measures  should be observed, such as regular hand hygiene practices before, during and after the match, do not  share drink bottles, and avoid touching your face.

It is acknowledged that contact sports have a greater risk of transmission than other sports, and as such,  should be considered on a case-by-case basis. However, other mitigation strategies for match socialisation  and contact must be employed to reduce the risk to players, visitors, and officials more broadly.

General hygiene measures at facilities

Facilities should ensure that:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Spaces at each facility, surfaces and objects are regularly cleaned with disinfectant;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Provide hand washing guidance (www.who.int/gpsc/clean_hands_protection/en/);  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Promote regular and thorough hand washing by staff and participants;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Provide sanitising hand rub dispensers in prominent places around the event (particularly entry or

high use areas such as a registration desk, change rooms, toilets or kiosk);  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Make sure dispensers are regularly refilled; and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Promote exclusion of ill persons.

Gyms, indoor fitness centres and swimming pools

Settings like gyms, indoor fitness centres and swimming pools are not required to close at this time  providing they meet these requirements for social distancing and hand hygiene. Such venues should take  actions to ensure regular high standards of environmental cleaning take place.
