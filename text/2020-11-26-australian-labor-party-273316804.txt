THURSDAY, 26 NOVEMBER 2020



SUBJECTS: State borders, rugby league, the Real Man Quiz



HOST: Welcome to the Big Breakfast.



ANTHONY ALBANESE, LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY: Good to be

with you.



HOST: Oh mate, you've been busy lately. Can I just get your, well you can come up here

and you can leave anytime you like now after Annastacia Palaszczuk said this -



NEWSREADER: Five words to end four months of families divided…



ANNASTACIA PALASZCZUK, PREMIER OF QUEENSLAND: Queensland is good to go.



HOST: You're coming up?



ALBANESE: How good’s that? Of course I’ll be up there. I'll be up there in December.



HOST: Hey Albo, I saw you with Vossy, and I know you’re a big Rabbitohs fan, Andrew

Voss, you know, on Fox Sports?



ALBANESE: I did.



HOST: But you actually said these words. “Rabbitohs loss hurts me more than Origin loss.”

Is that what’s wrong with New South Wales in State of Origin, you don’t care enough?



ALBANESE: It could well be. I think Queenslanders are really motivated, more so perhaps

than the New South Wales people from experience. I mean Dane Gagai…



HOST: Yes.



ALBANESE: Pulls on that maroon jumper and he dances like James Tedesco, he runs like

Greg Inglis, he tackles like Gorden Tallis, I mean he's just unbelievable.



HOST:  Should they put an Origin singlet underneath his Rabbitohs jersey every week and

maybe he’d play like that all the time?



ALBANESE: Well, I'm gonna have a talk to Benny and I reckon I reckon in the off season

you'll see a new Dane Gagai on round one versus the Storm. Look out.



HOST: Yeah Albo is that why you’re excited about the Victorian borders opening up?



ALBANESE: Well it is game one, I noticed. It’s been announced.



HOST: Storm v Rabbitohs at AAMI Park, round one in the NRL next year.



ALBANESE: A Thursday night. And the best two grounds in Australia are of course

Suncorp is the best ground in Australia but AAMI Park I reckon is the second best rugby

league ground…



HOST: Oh that’s some super sucking up there Albo. Well done mate.



ALBANESE: You’re right. Melbourne aren’t even listening. It’s just true. Our home ground

of course is ANZ where you need to bring the binoculars to see Alex Johnson streaking

down that wing.



HOST: Albo, talk to us about the tone of Sydney and New South Wales. Obviously we

pretty Queensland heavy and Annastacia Palaszczuk’s stance on the borders and not

opening up to New South Wales. What is Sydney? What are you doing down there?

What's Gladys doing? What’s your thoughts on it?



ALBANESE: Well, Gladys has got her own problems at the moment of course.



HOST: Doesn't she have the coronavirus?



ALBANESE: She had a test and then thought it was okay to walk into Parliament. A no-no

to say the least. Annastacia Palaszczuk, I think Queenslanders had their say on her

leadership and keeping them safe and they voted a resoundingly “yes”.



HOST: I think we're pretty sure that ScoMo doesn't qualify at this, but I'd like you to take

the Real Man Quiz if you could. When’s the last time, there’s a couple of questions, when’s

the last time you reversed a trailer?



ALBANESE: Reversed a trailer?



HOST: Do you own one?



ALBANESE: Oh my goodness. I certainly don’t own a trailer mate. I don’t but I have, it

would have been when I was moving or helping actually someone in my office move. So it

was last year.



HOST: Okay, that's nice. Last fish caught?



ALBANESE: I'm pretty ordinary fishing. But I did go fishing on Kangaroo Island down there

in South Australia for King George whiting. I’ve got to say, it was fantastic because I had

the bloke who, they have really strict catches there, and I had the bloke with us. I cheated

a little bit because he knew exactly where to go.





HOST: That’s what you need. Right mate. Right position. Anthony Albanese it’s been a

pleasure to have you on this morning. Oh actually, one more. If I gave you the choice: a

VB, a Tooheys New, a TED or a XXXX, which one would you prefer to drink?



ALBANESE: Oh, Tooheys New.



HOST: No the correct answer is they’re all shit. Federal Labor Leader Anthony Albanese.



ALBANESE: I’ve got to say, I don’t drink any of those three.



HOST: No, exactly. Federal Labor Leader the Honourable Anthony Albanese. Thank you

for joining the Big Breakfast and have a great Christmas.



ALBANESE: Cheers, same to you.
