VISIT TO AUSTRALIA BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND

I am pleased to announce I will host New Zealand Prime Minister Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern in Sydney on 28  February for our annual Australia-New Zealand Leaders’ Meeting.

New Zealand is an exceptionally close partner and friend to Australia. Our successful, collaborative  relationship is built on shared history and values, and it grows stronger every year.

Our close cooperation was demonstrated during recent disasters including the Black Summer bushfires  in Australia and the fatal Whakaari/White Island eruption in New Zealand. Our two countries continue  to coordinate on our response to the outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

During the visit, Prime Minister Ardern and I will discuss Trans-Tasman cooperation and issues of  common strategic interest, including regional security, international trade, and cooperation in the  Pacific.

I look forward to welcoming Prime Minister Ardern to Australia.
