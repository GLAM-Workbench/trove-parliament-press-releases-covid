MORRISON GOVERNMENT FAILS TO DELIVER PPE TRAINING TO 4 OUT

OF 5 AGED CARE WORKERS



Just one in five aged care workers had taken the Morrison Government’s training in

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) before COVID-19 outbreaks exploded in Victorian

nursing homes.



Answers provided through the Select Committee on COVID-19 reveal only 66,000 people

had completed aged care training in PPE by early June - Australia’s aged care workforce

is estimated to be more than 360,000.



These answers also reveal the Morrison Government spent just $44,000 on developing

this training.



On Monday the Prime Minister defended the Commonwealth’s work to prepare nursing

homes for COVID-19 by pointing to this training.



“No, we've been taking action on this for weeks now, for weeks and weeks. And I outline

those actions to you, in particular, taking the initiative to train the workforces in

aged care.”

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ SCOTT MORRISON, PRESS CONFERENCE, MONDAY 27 JULY 2020



There have been multiple reports about staff lacking the appropriate training in how to use

PPE in aged care which has contributed to issues at Victorian nursing homes.



This is yet more disturbing evidence of how little the Morrison Government prepared our

nation’s nursing homes for outbreaks of COVID-19.



We knew from international experience how vulnerable our older people in nursing homes

were to COVID-19. So why didn’t the Morrison Government do more to prepare workers?



Scott Morrison has said outbreaks will continue to occur, so it is vitally important every

aged care worker across the country has undertaken appropriate training.



The Morrison Government must now urgently ensure all aged care workers have

undertaken appropriate training in PPE and infection control.



We have seen the devastating impact of COVID-19 outbreaks in aged care in Australia

and across the globe.



Australia’s aged care system was broken before the COVID-19 pandemic and this is only

putting extra stress on the system.
