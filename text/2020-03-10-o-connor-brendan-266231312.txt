LABOR CONTINUES CALLS FOR GOVERNMENT TO IMPROVE SMALL

BUSINESS PAYMENT TIMES



For more than six years, this government has failed to act on improving payment times for

small businesses.



Reports today suggest improving payment times for small businesses could form part of

the response to the impacts of Coronavirus. Labor would welcome any crack down on

payment times and continues to call on the government to overcome its paralysis and take

action.



Action that ensures small businesses are paid on time should happen as a matter of

course, it shouldn’t take a crisis to make the government do the right thing.



Almost a year and a half ago, the Prime Minister promised to create a register of the

payment times of Australia’s 3,000 largest companies. They also promised they

would require big business to have a 20-day payment time to small business in order to get

government contracts.



Nearly 18 months later, nothing is up and running.



In fact, according to internal documents, “implementation is likely to take place in late



2021” and the draft legislation has raised ongoing concerns of stakeholders as confirmed

by the Small Business Division in Senate Estimates last week.



At no stage has Senator Cash ever condemned the abuse that often happens when

‘reverse factoring’ is involved - a dodgy scheme where small businesses pay a fee to be

paid on time, or have their payments blown out.



This supply chain financing practice is unconscionable, but merely the tip of the ice-berg as

these dodgy payment plans are risky and contribute to the economic woes we face.



We urge the government to speed up the implementation of this straightforward and

uncontroversial policy.



Extended payment times are an ongoing issue for small businesses around Australia.
