NOMINATIONS OPEN FOR THE 2021

AUSTRALIAN TRAINING AWARDS

Nominations are now open for the peak national awards of Australia’s vocational education  and training (VET) sector.

The 2021 Australian Training Awards will be held in Perth, Western Australia on Thursday  18 November to showcase the leaders in VET and provide inspiration for people to gain skills  for rewarding careers.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, says the awards will also help celebrate the resilience of the VET sector.

“This is a chance to recognise the best and brightest in the VET sector, as well as efforts to  overcome the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Minister Cash said.

“As we continue our economic recovery, we want to highlight the hard work of our students,  apprentices and trainees, as well as their teachers, trainers and employers.

“There are countless stories of inspiration over the last year that we want to shine a spotlight  on.

“I encourage anyone in the VET sector to put up their hands to recognise their hard work and  excellence.”

This year includes a new award category for outstanding achievement in the VET and skills  sector, recognising an individual’s outstanding leadership and contribution for more than  15 years.

Individuals and businesses can apply directly for categories that recognise:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Employers delivering innovative training to apprentices or trainees  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Schools, employers and training organisations collaboratively delivering VET  programs to secondary students, and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Individuals dedicated to improving language, literacy and numeracy skills in an

educational, community or workplace context.

Minister Cash said the Australian Training Awards form part of the Australian Government’s  commitment to the VET sector.

“The Australian Government is providing unprecedented support to the sector, including a  $1.2 billion expansion of the Supporting Apprenticeship Commencements wage subsidy.”

Nominations close 30 June 2021. More details and how to nominate can be found at  www.australiantrainingawards.gov.au.
