KRISTY MCBAIN MP

MEMBER FOR EDEN-MONARO





E&OE TRANSCRIPT

DOORSTOP INTERVIEW

PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA

TUESDAY, 6 OCTOBER 2020



SUBJECTS: $100 million in bushfire recovery funds; Budget.



KRISTY MCBAIN, MEMBER FOR EDEN-MONARO: Eden-Monaro has been hit hard by

the triple whammy of bushfires, drought and COVID-19. And whilst I appreciate the Snowy

Mountains is one of the [eligible] region's announced by the Deputy Prime Minister, the

Morrison Government has failed to recognise that most of Eden-Monaro has been

impacted by that triple whammy.



I call on the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister today in the budget to recognise

that the South Coast and the South West Slopes are among the hardest hit regions, but as

it stands, they miss out on this $100 million package.



During the by-election, there was plenty of talk about the Barton Highway, but there has

been no money established in this budget that we can see so far, for the Barton Highway,

the Princes Highway, or any other highway of significance talked about during the by-election.



If we are serious about putting more money into our regions, then start with Eden-Monaro,

the electorate hit hardest by all measures, by all data by all metrics. Let's get serious about

our region's.



JOURNALIST: What is your response to talk of the governments tax cuts being brought

forward?



I think the stage two tax cuts coming forward are a great idea. But tax cuts in and of



themselves will not stimulate the economy. It will not stimulate the economy and regions

like Eden-Monaro



Thank you very much.
