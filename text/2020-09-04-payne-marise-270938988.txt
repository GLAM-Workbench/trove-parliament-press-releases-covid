MEDIA RELEASE  HIGH COMMISSIONER TO NIUE

Today I announce the appointment of Ms Susan Allen as Australia’s first resident High  Commissioner to Niue.

Ms Allen has established our newly opened High Commission in Alofi. This is Australia's  17th diplomatic post in the Pacific, reflecting our commitment to deepening engagement  across the region.

Australia is committed to the stability, resilience and security of the Pacific region. Through our  Pacific Step-up and co-operation on regional responses to the health and economic impacts of  the COVID-19 pandemic, we are working more closely than ever with our Pacific partners.

Australia and Niue enjoy a friendly relationship based on shared participation in Pacific  regional organisations, development cooperation and our community links.

Ms Allen is a career officer with DFAT and was most recently director of the  department’s Fiji section. She has previously served overseas at the Australian  Embassy in Iraq, the Australian Embassy in Denmark, and the Australian High  Commission in Canada.

Ms Allen holds a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) from Queensland University, and a  Graduate Diploma in Foreign Affairs and Trade from the Australian National University.

I thank Australia’s previous non-resident High Commissioner, Head of the Office of the  Pacific, Ewen McDonald, for his contributions to advancing Australia’s interests in Niue.
