GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO COME CLEAN ON FUNDING FOR TOURISM  REGIONS

As one of the top five Australian destinations for both domestic and  international tourists, Gold Coast businesses are feeling the impact of the  bushfires and coronavirus.

There were more than 5 million international and national visitors to the Gold  Coast region just last year, spending a collective of more than 26 million nights  and more than $5 billion of spending in the region.

The Tourism and Transport Forum says they have already seen a 40 per cent  decrease in international visitors in the Gold Coast alone since the start of the  outbreak - that equates to a loss of 400,000 international visitors to the region.

While the Palaszczuk Government has done its bit, announcing a multimillion-dollar package for Queenslanders, five weeks after the federal government cut  off flights from China, Scott Morrison still hasn’t announced any new support for  small businesses affected by the shocking downturn.

The Prime Minister is trying to pull the wool over our eyes, raiding the $76  million budget dedicated to bushfire recovery in order to claim he is also



helping businesses which are impacted by coronavirus.

Even the Morrison Government’s own backbencher admits there is money  being set aside from the bushfire recovery.

Regions like the Gold Coast are taking a huge hit from coronavirus, with  businesses and jobs that rely on tourism doing it really tough.

But the Morrison Government seems to be stretching bushfire recovery support  so thin it’s almost invisible, instead of providing additional assistance to deal  with the added impact of coronavirus - they need to explain why.

Businesses affected by the outbreak deserve a targeted response and  dedicated funding - not just a re-announcement of an existing program and  more spin from the Morrison Government
