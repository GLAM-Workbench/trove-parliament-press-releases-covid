Contracts signed for rollout of COVID-19 vaccine

Contracts have been signed with companies to partner with the Australian Government to  safely distribute COVID-19 vaccines to all Australians from March next year.

The contracts cover three vital aspects of the vaccine rollout:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Distribution and logistics— industry leading providers DHL and Linfox will  undertake COVID-19 vaccine distribution.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Data—Accenture will provide tracking of vaccine doses as well as enabling overall  program implementation monitoring.

In addition, PwC will be the Department of Health’s Program Delivery Partner for the vaccine  rollout.

Finalisation of these contracts confirms Australia is on track to achieve a well-ordered,  efficient and safe rollout of COVID-19 vaccine. Subject to approvals, the first vaccinations  will be provided to health workers and aged care residents from March.

DHL and Linfox will work with the Department of Health to design and operate a national  distribution network. They will support vaccination for all, including people in rural, remote  and very remote areas and others who are hard to reach.

They will also be required to track and report the temperature of the vaccine at all times. The  required temperature could be 2 to 8 degrees (standard cold chain temperatures) to as low as  minus 70, which is needed for the Pfizer vaccine.

Purpose built dry ice containers will be supplied for moving the Pfizer vaccine around  Australia, as part of the Government’s global distribution deal with Pfizer.

As well as transporting the vaccines from the point of acceptance from manufacturers to  vaccination administration sites, the logistics partners will be responsible for transport and  management of vaccination supplies such as needles, syringes, and personal protective  equipment.

Data partner Accenture will design, develop, and implement a software solution to enable  “point in time” visibility of COVID-19 vaccine doses across the delivery chain.

This will include receipt of the vaccine by health services, vaccination of patients, and  subsequent monitoring for adverse reactions.

Vaccines will be a critical part of Australia’s ongoing response to COVID-19 and the  Australia Government has secured over 117 million doses to cover the Australian population  several times over.

Vaccines will complement the other vital health measures including social distancing, good  hand hygiene, high testing rates and Australians mandatory hotel quarantine regime for  international travellers.

Our advice remains that Australia remains on track for first vaccinations in March, and  completion of whole of population in 2021.

Australia’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic remains the envy of the world.
