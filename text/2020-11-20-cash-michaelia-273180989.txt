BEST AND BRIGHTEST RECOGNISED AT THE   2020 AUSTRALIAN TRAINING AWARDS

The best and the brightest in Australia’s vocational education and training (VET) sector have  been recognised for their excellence, hard work and dedication at the 2020 Australian  Training Awards.

Seventeen awards have been presented to students, apprentices, trainees, teachers, Registered  Training Organisations and employers in a virtual ceremony broadcast online today.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said the VET sector should be immensely proud of its achievements during a very  challenging year.

“Despite the challenges of COVID-19, tonight’s Award recipients have demonstrated  remarkable resilience,” Minister Cash said.

“They serve as leaders and role models to their peers and I know their stories will inspire  others to consider a VET qualification.

“I congratulate each and every one of our winners and finalists.”

The recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award went to Mary Campbell, CEO of TAFE  Queensland, who has spent more than 30 years in leadership roles in the VET sector.

Debbie Blow received the National Achievement Award for her work improving the quality  of training in health and nursing.

Assistant Minister for Vocational Education, Training and Apprenticeships, the Hon Steve  Irons MP, said the Morrison Government is proud to support the Australian Training Awards  and is proud to support the VET sector, providing almost $7 billion in funding this year alone  as part of our skills-led recovery.

“This includes partnering with the states and territories to establish the $1 billion JobTrainer  Fund, providing around an additional 340,000 free or low-fee training places to help  Australians upskill and reskill in areas of demand,” Assistant Minister Irons said.

“We are investing in apprenticeships, creating jobs and boosting the skills of Australians to  help them get back into work.”
