$2 MILLION FOR VITAL CORONAVIRUS RESEARCH

Applications have opened for the Australian Government’s $2 million grant opportunity to  support research into development of a vaccine to protect against novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

COVID-19 represents a significant and urgent threat to global health, with the overwhelming  majority of cases in Wuhan City in China, and increasing numbers in other countries,  including Australia.

The objective of this open and competitive grant opportunity is to accelerate research into  development of a safe, effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Given the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, applicants must propose  research that will support the rapid development of a vaccine, including demonstration of  partnerships that will provide access to critical resources necessary to complete the project.

The grant opportunity is funded from the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF), the  Morrison Government’s $20 billion investment to support vital health and medical research  that we can use to react swiftly to emerging health issues.

Australia has produced some of the world’s best medical research. This is another example of  us contributing to address important health challenges for Australians and for the global  population.

Research plays a critical role in ensuring Australia maintains its world-class health system  and is particularly important as the world responds to COVID-19.
