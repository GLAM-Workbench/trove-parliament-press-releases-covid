NITA GREEN

SENATOR FOR QUEENSLAND



E&OE TRANSCRIPT  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA  THURSDAY, 27 AUGUST 2020

SUBJECT: Aged care.

NITA GREEN, SENATOR FOR QUEENSLAND: Today in the Senate the Aged Care  Minister Richard Colbeck will be required to come into the Senate and explain himself. This  is a motion passed by the Senate yesterday, supported by the Senate, to demand that  Richard Colbeck come into the Senate and explain himself and his failures on aged care.

So far, the answers that he has been giving in Question Time haven’t actually answered  the questions about why this Government didn’t have an aged care plan and why the  Federal Government is trying to shirk responsibility for aged care onto the states.

Scott Morrison doesn’t have a plan for aged care. Richard Colbeck doesn’t have a plan for  aged care. But we know that Anthony Albanese does have a plan for aged care and he will  be outlining it today at the National Press Club.

Some of the very important things that we need to consider and we need to plan for  include making sure staff have enough resources and are trained adequately. One of the  things I have done during this COVID pandemic is talk to aged care workers directly and I  can tell you they are terrified. They know that they do not have enough resources if an  outbreak were to occur in Queensland because this Government has failed to plan and  failed to give them the resources they need to take care of the residents that they love and  they care for deeply.

We know that today Richard Colbeck needs to come in and answer why the Federal  Government doesn’t have a plan and what explanation he is going to give to the families  who need answers. If he doesn’t do that today, this Minister really needs to consider his  future as Aged Care Minister.
