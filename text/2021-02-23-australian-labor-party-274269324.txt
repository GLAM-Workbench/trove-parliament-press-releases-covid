SHADOW MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE

MEMBER FOR FRANKLIN





LITTLEPROUD MIA ON WORKFORCE STRATEGY AS FOOD ROTS ON

FARMS



The Morrison Government is still yet to release or respond to the recommendations of a critical

agriculture workforce strategy report it received last year.



This is despite producers facing losses of more than $45 million from rotting crops due to

workforce shortages on farms.



Labor has written to Minister Littleproud calling for him to finally step up and respond to this

report with a real plan to address gaps in Australia’s agriculture workforce.



Minister Littleproud and the Nationals are more interested in shameless politicking than

showing leadership for Australian farmers.



Restrictions related to COVID-19 have highlighted longstanding issues in Australia’s

agriculture workforce which is why action is needed now.



It’s unacceptable that, despite huge losses on farms across the country, the Minister has yet to

release the report.



The Morrison Government has failed to take responsibility for labour shortages - farmers just

want this fixed.





Minister Littleproud should stop passing the buck and start working to fix issues or Australian

produce will continue to rot on the farms.
