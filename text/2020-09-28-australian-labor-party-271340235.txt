DELOITTE: JOBS PLAN NEEDED TO FILL HOLE FROM GOVERNMENT CUTS

A new report from Deloitte has called on the Government to develop a comprehensive plan  for jobs, to fill the gap left by the Government’s cuts to vital support programs.

In the face of unacceptably high unemployment, the Morrison Government has today cut  vital JobKeeper support for millions of Australians, without any jobs plan to replace it.

Deloitte’s latest Budget Monitor warns that unemployment will be higher for longer unless  the Government steps up to “fill the holes in the economy”.

According to Deloitte:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢    “Families are struggling with the toxic trio of high debt, high unemployment, and low  confidence. Businesses are worried the economy will stay flat for some time… And the  Reserve Bank is already doing pretty much everything it can”;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢    “Families and businesses are set for a big cash crunch between now and end-March  2021 as emergency responses run out”; and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢    “Australia’s recovery is very reliant on governments going hard and going smart.”

The report also highlights the merits of pro-jobs policies suggested by Labor, including  investments in social housing and aged care, a permanently higher unemployment benefit  and a business investment allowance.

Since the start of this crisis, Labor has been consistent that the priority needs to be jobs  and our response has been guided by this principle.

Any new spending is borrowed money - it can’t be wasted on mates, or rorts, or dodgy  deals, or pork barrelling.

New spending needs to get bang for buck, protect jobs, create secure jobs, train and up-skill Australians and support families doing it tough.



Australians deserve a plan from the Morrison Government to promote growth, protect and  create jobs, support business and set us all up for the recovery.
