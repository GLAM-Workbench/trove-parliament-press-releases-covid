Ag sector grows strong female leaders

Ã¯ÂÂ· International Day of Rural Women is observed on 15 October each year.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Yesterday Minister for Agriculture David Littleproud attended the Graduation of  the 2020 Diversity in Agriculture Leadership Program.

On International Day of Rural Women, 12 outstanding female leaders with skills and a  vision for agriculture are ready to take the industry by storm.

Minister for Agriculture, David Littleproud, congratulated graduates of the National  Farmers’ Federation (NFF) 2020 Diversity in Agriculture Leadership Program and  recognised the outstanding contributions of women in rural Australia.

“We are fortunate in the agriculture sector to be surrounded by women who provide strong  leadership to the industry,” Minister Littleproud said.

“With the support of my department, this leadership program has been connecting women  with one-on-one mentoring and personal development opportunities since 2018.

“The result has been real progress towards doubling the number of women in leadership  ranks by 2030, with 50 per cent of appointments to agricultural bodies now women up from  38% in 2017 when I took over as Agriculture Minister.

This wasn’t about quotas this was simply about putting an environment around woman to  feel comfortable to come forward.

“The twelve graduates who have now completed the program offer a range of expertise in  areas from science, research and development, farm health and safety, to education and  farm business management.

“Past graduates have gone on to assume federal and state government-based board roles  and to be high-profile female advocates and leaders for our sector.

“While it has been a year of challenges for regions, female leaders continue to be at the  forefront of innovation and building the productivity and resilience of rural communities.

“For example, the Buy From a Bush Business Marketplace created by Sarah Britz, Lauren  Hately and Jenn Donovan is supporting small rural and regional enterprises impacted by  bushfire, drought and coronavirus.

“This is helping regional industries to bounce back and in turn positively influencing the  mental health of employees and families.

“Similarly, the winner of this year’s Tasmanian AgriFuture’s Rural Women’s Award, Karen  Brock, is changing the face of the plant supply chain.

“Karen has created a process which accelerates traditional propagation methods, creating  faster harvesting times for farmers and providing food security to the agri business sector.

“We must not forget the role regional and rural women play across Australia, building  productivity and cohesion as farmers, managers, volunteers and within the household.

“Today we recognise their outstanding contributions, and the need for continued  momentum to ensure even more women are supported into agriculture and leadership  roles,” Minister Littleproud said.
