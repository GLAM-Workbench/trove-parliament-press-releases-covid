JOBMAKER OR JOBFAKER?



The ambiguity of the Morrison Government’s much lauded JobMaker program has

intensified following questioning at today’s Senate COVID committee.



Officials from the Department of Education, Skills and Employment could not unveil full

details of what the JobMaker plan entails. Questions as to the exact detail of what the

program actually is, the number of jobs it will create and whether there is even a plan

behind its implementation, could not be answered.



Senator Gallagher today asked the Department who the lead agency is for JobMaker, and

the Department said there really wasn’t one.



Senator Gallagher also asked if there was an interdepartmental committee between

departments on JobMaker, and the answer was not specifically on JobMaker.



Senator Keneally asked the what the difference is between JobMaker and JobTrainer.



The Department answered: “My understanding, Senator is it’s largely the same thing.”



At the end of questioning we are left under a cloud of confusion.



The JobMaker Program was announced by the Prime Minister with much fanfare as a plan



to boost employment and economic growth to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.



With unemployment and underemployment at record levels, it is appalling that the

government doesn’t have a comprehensive plan for jobs.



JobMaker is simply another marketing slogan from the Prime Minister which completely

lacks substance.



It is, unfortunately, another example of the Morrison government announcing something

new,  but never delivering.



We don’t want to see a jobless recovery where even more Australians are left behind and

held back.



Vulnerable workers, businesses and communities need and deserve a comprehensive

plan to tackle the jobs crisis and create well-paid, secure jobs into the future.
