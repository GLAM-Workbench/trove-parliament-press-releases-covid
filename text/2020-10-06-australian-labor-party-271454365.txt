ONE TRILLION OF DEBT AND UNEMPLOYMENT

STILL TOO HIGH FOR TOO LONG



The Budget will rack up a trillion dollars of debt but still doesn’t do enough to

create jobs, fails to build for the future and leaves too many Australians behind.



Despite producing a grab-bag of headline-seeking announcements, the

Government expects another 160,000 Australians to be added to the jobless

queues by Christmas.



Scott Morrison is leaving Australia with one trillion dollars of debt but

unemployment is too high for too long, with the jobless rate not expected to get

back to pre-crisis levels even after four years.



That’s one trillion dollars of debt but millions of Australians left behind, including

928,000 people aged over 35 on unemployment benefits deliberately excluded

from hiring subsidies.



One trillion dollars of debt, a track record of no delivery and no plan for the

future.





There is no plan to lift the permanent rate of JobSeeker from $40 per day,

tackle insecure work, create opportunities for women or to improve access to

child care.



No plan for social housing, cheaper and cleaner energy, or to address the crisis

in aged care.



No plan to kick-start the economy, boost productivity, increase participation, or

lift the speed limit on growth.



While the average worker will receive a $50 per fortnight tax cut, millions on

JobKeeper have seen their payment cut by at least $300 per fortnight.



Decisions taken by the Liberals in this Budget mean that the Morrison

Recession will be deeper and longer than necessary.
