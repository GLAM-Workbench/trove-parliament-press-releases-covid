Seasonal workforce breakthrough a boost  for farmers, food supply and economy



Ã¯ÂÂ· The Australian Government has agreed to allow targeted recruitment of labour  under the Pacific Labour Scheme and Seasonal Worker Programme.  Ã¯ÂÂ· This will support farmers facing critical workforce shortages.  Ã¯ÂÂ· State and territory governments can now work with industry to develop proposals

to assist farmers access the workers they need.

Agriculture Minister David Littleproud says the Australian Government has developed a  national plan to allow seasonal and Pacific workers to fill farming’s labour void and help  support Australia’s COVID-19 recovery.

“This sensible approach developed by the Australian Government ensures our farmers can  keep feeding the nation and supplying the world,” Minister Littleproud said.

“I have written to state and territory agriculture ministers urging them to work with their  colleagues and farmer sector to take advantage of the reopening of the Seasonal Worker  Program and Pacific Labour Scheme.

“With appropriate state and territory plans and quarantine arrangements in place, seasonal  and Pacific workers can safely support farmers facing critical workforce shortages.

“Agriculture is the engine of regional and rural Australia and is an essential industry,  contributing $60 billion annually to our GDP.

“Many regions are expecting above average crop production following good rains.

“But farmers can’t fill harvest jobs because of COVID-19 travel restrictions, with people  prevented from moving across state borders, overseas workers and working holiday makers in  scarce supply.

“More than 40 per cent of working holiday makers have departed Australia since the border  closures, and while there are still around 8,000 Pacific and Timorese workers in Australia, this  is nowhere near enough to meet the upcoming harvest needs.

“It is critical farmers have access to labour to help them capitalise on the favourable conditions  and ensure agriculture continues powering Australia’s economy and feeding our nation.

“We are allowing targeted recruitment of labour under the Pacific Labour Scheme and  Seasonal Worker Programme.

“This decision gives industry certainty so they can plan their workforce needs and know that  harvesting our fruit and vegetables can be done at the right time so food doesn’t go to waste.

“There will continue to be rigorous labour market testing to provide Australians with an  opportunity to apply for these seasonal jobs first.

“This announcement builds on the visa changes we’ve made to keep temporary workers here  longer to support critical sectors like agriculture as the nation recovers from COVID-19.

“The Australian Government will continue to be agile in our response to COVID-19 and in  ensuring we do everything within our power to help our farm sector and regional communities  rise to the many challenges this pandemic is presenting,” Minister Littleproud said today.
