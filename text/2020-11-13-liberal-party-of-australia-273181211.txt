Research collaborations to strengthen our economy

The Morrison Government is investing more than $26 million in university research as part of  our plan to help drive Australia’s economic recovery from COVID-19.

Minister for Education Dan Tehan today announced funding for 60 research collaborations  under the Australian Research Council’s (ARC) Linkage Projects scheme.

“These research projects are part of our Government’s plan to invest in ideas and innovation  in areas of national interest to help power Australia’s economic recovery from COVID-19,”  Mr Tehan said.

“This investment in research will complement the additional $1 billion for university research  and $157 million for research infrastructure announced in the 2020 Budget.

“As part of our Job-ready Graduates reforms we are also providing $900 million to establish  the National Priorities and Industry Linkage Fund to fund further partnerships between  universities and industry, with a strong focus on investment in STEM industries.

“By bringing together higher education and industry, these research projects will support  universities to produce job-ready graduates for their local industries and communities.”

Funded projects include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $661,039 to deliver a more cost-effective system to produce hybrid wheat varieties  on a commercial scale. The outcome will be higher and more stable wheat yield  gains in Australia and worldwide, contributing to higher food security for the growing  population (The University of Western Australia).

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $456,000 to address the critical mineral resource potential of complex copper ores.  This will lead to integrated models for critical element endowments in Australia’s  largest copper resource, Olympic Dam in South Australia. Future recovery of these  elements would also add significant value to existing operations, providing long-term  economic and commercial benefits (The University of Adelaide).
