Seventh Diamond Princess Passenger Tests Positive for COVID-19

A seventh passenger from the Diamond Princess has today tested positive to Coronavirus  (COVID-19) at the Manigurr-ma Village quarantine facility in Darwin.

The 57-year-old Queensland woman has mild illness and will remain in isolation overnight at  the evacuation centre before being transported back to her home state on a specialised  medical retrieval plane tomorrow.

This brings to 22 the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Australia.

Australian authorities were well prepared to quickly diagnose the Queensland woman was  positive to the coronavirus and ensure she could be safely transported back to Queensland.

Earlier today, four other passengers from the Diamond Princess who had tested positive  returned to their home states of Queensland and Victoria for isolation and care.

It is very important to assure the Howard Springs community these latest positive tests pose  no risk to the broader community.

We are well prepared and have responded as planned with strict public health measures in  place.
