Pausing debt activity during the coronavirus pandemic

The Australian Government is implementing a pause on debt raising and recovery activity through  Services Australia to help ease pressure on people’s budgets during the coronavirus pandemic.

The decision allows Australians to focus on their personal situation during these difficult times, and  supports the Government’s priority to get assistance to people as quickly as possible.

During disaster events, such as the recent bushfires, debt raising and recovery activities are routinely  suspended within the affected areas. The coronavirus pandemic falls into this category, however its  impact is nationwide.

Pausing certain debt activity also enables the redeployment of staff to assist in areas of critical need,  like claims processing for those Australians impacted by the pandemic.

Work relating to fraud and serious non-compliance will continue in order to maintain the integrity of  the welfare system.

The temporary pause will be for an initial period of six months.

Existing repayment arrangements will continue unless people contact Services Australia. Those who  need to reduce or take a break from repayments should speak to Services Australia about their personal  circumstances by calling 1800 076 072.
