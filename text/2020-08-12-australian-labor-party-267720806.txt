EXTRAORDINARY AFTERNOON OF EVIDENCE AT ROYAL COMMISSION

EXPOSES MORRISON GOVERNMENT’S AGED CARE FAILURES



The Morrison Government’s failure to learn from tragic outbreaks of COVID-19

in New South Wales nursing homes has been exposed after extraordinary

evidence at the Royal Commission.



Evidence has confirmed what Labor has been saying: time and time again the

Morrison Government has been behind the eight ball as a terrible tragedy has

unfolded in aged care.



It is up to the Prime Minister to now front up and answer questions about why

his Government was so ill prepared for these tragic outbreaks.



The Federal Government is responsible for aged care in Australia.  Scott

Morrison needs to take responsibility for these failings and provide families and

loved ones with answers to what has gone wrong.



Evidence revealed the Morrison Government was aware after outbreaks of

COVID-19 in NSW nursing homes that entire workforces could be lost which

directly contradicts claims by Scott Morrison that similar issues in Victoria which

caused tragedies could not have been ‘anticipated’.



“What had occurred over the weekend, in particular, which rapidly escalated the

situation in a number of these facilities was the complete withdrawal of the

workforce. That is not something that happened at Newmarch House in New

South Wales. This was a new situation, something that had not been

anticipated or foreshadowed at a state level or considered at a federal level.”



SCOTT MORRISON, PRESS CONFERENCE, 29 JULY 2020



Officials were forced to concede the Morrison Government could do better on

PPE training for aged care workers following previous revelations just one in

five workers had completed the training on the eve of outbreaks of COVID-19 in

Victorian nursing homes.



Evidence also highlighted the deeply concerning delays in the Morrison

Government’s decision to make face masks in aged care mandatory.



The Morrison Government must now learn and act to prevent further outbreaks

in the aged care system.



We have seen the devastating impact of COVID-19 outbreaks in aged care in

Australia and across the globe.



Why was the Morrison Government not better prepared for outbreaks that

would impact our nation’s most vulnerable?



Australia’s aged care system was broken before the COVID-19 pandemic and

this is only putting extra stress on the system.





The Morrison Government must do better for our most vulnerable older

Australians.
