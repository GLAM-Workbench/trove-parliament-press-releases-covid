JOINT MEDIA RELEASE

FINAL PROJECTS ANNOUNCED THROUGH $134.5 MILLION  GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE

North and north-west Queensland communities will benefit from more than $10 million to repair,  rebuild and reinforce infrastructure damaged by the 2019 monsoon trough.

The 12 projects represent the final tranche to be approved through the Australian and Queensland  governments’ $134.5 million infrastructure package.

Minister for Emergency Management David Littleproud said a total of 35 councils and two state  agencies have shared in funding to deliver 139 projects that build regional resilience throughout  Queensland.

“We continue to push ahead with our recovery efforts despite the effects of COVID-19, ” Minister  Littleproud said.

“This follows years of storms, bushfires and flooding that have severely impacted huge patches of  Queensland.

“Strengthening community resilience requires ongoing infrastructure investment, which is why we  keep prioritising spending on roads, floodways and drainage.

“Today’s announcement is another boost for the north and north-west of our state.”

Queensland Treasurer and Minister responsible for the Queensland Reconstruction Authority  (QRA) Cameron Dick said in addition to better protecting communities, the infrastructure projects  will also create more jobs in the regions.

“We are steadfast in our commitment to make Queensland the most disaster-resilient state in  Australia,” Mr Dick said.

“That means building stronger infrastructure and that leads to job creation, two things core to our  Unite and Recover economic plan.
