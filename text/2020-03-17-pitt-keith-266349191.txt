Victoria gas decision welcomed



Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia Keith Pitt has welcomed an overdue  decision by the Victorian Government to lift the moratorium on onshore conventional gas  exploration and development.

“This is an important step forward for an industry that has the potential to be a major economic  contributor to Victoria and Australia once the ban is lifted from mid-2021,” Mr Pitt said.

“I am pleased the Victorian Government now accepts the true science around the benefits of  developing the state’s gas industry and what it will mean for manufacturing.

“Not only will the decision help boost domestic gas supplies, it will generate million on royalties  for Victoria

the decision on conventional gas is a good win for the state, Minister Pitt said he was  disappointed Victoria didn’t take the opportunity to reverse its ban on unconventional gas  exploration.

“Victoria has potentially enormous shale and tight gas resources that could generate billions in  revenue and create thousands of locals jobs,” Minister Pitt said.

The Resources sector will play a vitally important role in leading the post-coronavirus economic  recovery.

“With the challenge that the Australian and world economy is facing from the COVID-19  pandemic, Australian industry will be well placed to lead the economic bounce back that will  come.” Mr Pitt added.
