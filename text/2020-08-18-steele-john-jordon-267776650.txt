DISABILITY ROYAL COMMISSION RESUMES IN SYDNEY: WE SHOULD

BE SAFE TO TELL OUR STORIES

Tuesday 18 August 2020

Despite being more than a year into the Disability Royal Commission process,

the Morrison government has failed to legislate to protect witnesses who wish

to give their evidence anonymously and in confidence.



Australian Greens Disability RIghts and Services spokesperson  Senator

Jordon Steele-John said the impediment is having a chilling effect on the ability

of the Royal Commission to do it's important work.



"As public hearings of the Disability Royal Commission resume today in

Sydney, we know that many stories and experiences simply won't be able to be

heard," Steele



"For more than a year the Morrison government has known that current laws

aren’t strong enough to protect the privacy of witnesses to the Disability Royal

Commission, yet they’ve done nothing about it.

"So many people in our community have lost all faith in the system because of

the violence, abuse, exploitation or neglect they, or their family, have

suffered. Disabled people and their families want to know that it is safe to tell

their stories.



Now, as public hearings start again to hear about people’s experiences during

the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s more important than ever that our Royal

Commission can hear evidence from as many people as possible.

"I have written to the Attorney General on a number of occassions asking him

to expedite this process and am hopeful these protections will be legislated as

a matter of priority during the next sitting of Parliament."
