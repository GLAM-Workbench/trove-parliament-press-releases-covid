AMA JOINS CALLS FOR ACTION ON QUARANTINE



It’s time for the Morrison Government to do it’s job, listen to the experts and deliver

on federal Quarantine - to keep Australians safe and to help the 38,000

Australians stranded overseas get home.



The AMA has today called on the Government to establish dedicated quarantine

facilities similar to the Northern Territory’s Howard Springs camp.



The Government’s own hand-picked advisor Jane Halton has briefed Scott

Morrison three times on the need for a national border control quarantine system to

keep Australians safe from COVID-19.



Ms Halton has told Scott Morrison;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the Federal Government can run quarantine under Federal legislation,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ how the Federal Government can run quarantine safely - including

imposing exclusion zones around quarantine facilities; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the Federal Government should open up further quarantine centres like at

RAAF Learmonth.

But a year into this pandemic, Scott Morrison still has no plan for safe national

quarantine.



As a consequence, 38,000 Australians remain stranded and businesses have no

certainty over our borders - which will cost jobs.



“The experts are telling us what needs to be done - so when will Scott Morrison

stop passing the buck to the states, and step up and deliver on what is a core

federal responsibility?” said Senator Penny Wong, Labor’s Foreign Affairs

spokesperson.



“We have tens of thousands of Australians stranded around the world, some who

have been stuck since the start of this pandemic, and some in increasingly

desperate situations - the only roadblock to getting them home is Scott Morrison’s

refusal to act.”



“Scott Morrison is standing on the sidelines leaving it to the states to protect

Australia from the more dangerous strains that are emerging, including B117,” the

Shadow Minister for Health, Chris Bowen said.



“An Australian passport used to mean something. Australians, whether they are at

home or overseas, deserve the support and the protection of their government -

instead stranded Australians are being left behind,” said Mr Bowen.
