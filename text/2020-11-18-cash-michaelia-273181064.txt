SUPPORTING SOUTH AUSTRALIANS THROUGH COVID-19

The Australian Government will lift mutual obligation requirements for job seekers in   South Australia from today 18 November 2020 until Sunday 29 November 2020.

This follows an announcement by the South Australian Government that the state will  undertake a six-day shutdown to curb a COVID-19 outbreak in the state.

No South Australian job seeker will face payment suspension or financial penalties for failing  to meet their mutual obligation requirements - such as not being able to attend appointments  or activities.

Job seekers are still being encouraged to remain connected to employment services to ensure  they are supported to access the full range of assistance including mental health services, if  required.

This will apply to job seekers in jobactive, Online Employment Services and Disability  Employment Services and participants in ParentsNext,

The Australian Government will continue to closely monitor the situation in South Australia.
