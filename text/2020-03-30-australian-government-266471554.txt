JOBKEEPER PAYMENT — INFORMATION FOR EMPLOYERS

Last updated: 30 March 2020

ECONOMIC RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS

OBLIGATIONS ON EMPLOYERS

To receive the JobKeeper Payment, employers must:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Register an intention to apply on the ATO website and assess that they have or will experience the  required turnover decline.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Provide information to the ATO on eligible employees. This includes information on the number of  eligible employees engaged as at 1 March 2020 and those currently employed by the business  (including those stood down or rehired). For most businesses, the ATO will use Single Touch Payroll  data to pre-populate the employee details for the business.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ensure that each eligible employee receives at least $1,500 per fortnight (before tax). For  employees that were already receiving this amount from the employer then their income will not  change. For employees that have been receiving less than this amount, the employer will need to top  up the payment to the employee up to $1,500, before tax. And for those employees earning more  than this amount, the employer is able to provide them with a top-up.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Notify all eligible employees that they are receiving the JobKeeper Payment.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to provide information to the ATO on a monthly basis, including the number of eligible  employees employed by the business.

BACKGROUND ON JOBKEEPER PAYMENT

Under the JobKeeper Payment, businesses impacted by the Coronavirus will be able to access a subsidy  from the Government to continue paying their employees. Affected employers will be able to claim a  fortnightly payment of $1,500 per eligible employee from 30 March 2020, for a maximum period of  6 months.

ELIGIBLE employers

Employers will be eligible for the subsidy if:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ their business has a turnover of less than $1 billion and their turnover will be reduced by more than  30 per cent relative to a comparable period a year ago (of at least a month); or

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ their business has a turnover of $1 billion or more and their turnover will  be reduced by more than  50 per cent relative to a comparable period a year ago (of at least a month); and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the business is not subject to the Major Bank Levy.

The employer must have been in an employment relationship with eligible employees as at 1 March 2020,  and confirm that each eligible employee is currently engaged in order to receive JobKeeper Payments.

Not-for-profit entities (including charities) and self-employed individuals (businesses without employees)  that meet the turnover tests that apply for businesses are eligible to apply for JobKeeper Payments.

Eligible employees

Eligible employees are employees who:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ are currently employed by the eligible employer (including those stood down or re-hired);

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ were employed by the employer at 1 March 2020;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ are full-time, part-time, or long-term casuals (a casual employed on a regular basis for longer than  12 months as at 1 March 2020);

Last updated: 30 March 2020 2

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ are at least 16 years of age;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ are an Australian citizen, the holder of a permanent visa, a Protected Special Category Visa Holder, a  non-protected Special Category Visa Holder who has been residing continually in Australia for 10  years or more, or a Special Category (Subclass 444) Visa Holder; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ are not in receipt of a JobKeeper Payment from another employer.

If your employees receive the JobKeeper Payment, this may affect their eligibility for payments from  Services Australia as they must report their JobKeeper Payment as income.

APPLICATION PROCESS

Businesses with employees

Initially, employers can register their interest in applying for the JobKeeper Payment via ato.gov.au from  30 March 2020.

Subsequently, eligible employers will be able to apply for the scheme by means of an online application.  The first payment will be received by employers from the ATO in the first week of May.

Eligible employers will need to identify eligible employees for JobKeeper Payments and must provide  monthly updates to the ATO.

Participating employers will be required to ensure eligible employees will receive, at a minimum,  $1,500 per fortnight, before tax.

It will be up to the employer if they want to pay superannuation on any additional wage paid because of  the JobKeeper Payment.

Further details for businesses for employees will be provided on ato.gov.au.

Businesses without employees

Businesses without employees, such as the self-employed, can register their interest in applying for  JobKeeper Payment via ato.gov.au from 30 March 2020.

Businesses without employees will need to provide an ABN for their business, nominate an individual to  receive the payment and provide that individual’s Tax File Number and provide a declaration as to recent  business activity.

People who are self-employed will need to provide a monthly update to the ATO to declare their continued  eligibility for the payments. Payment will be made monthly to the individual’s bank account.

Further details for the self-employed will be provided on ato.gov.au.



Employer with employees on different wages

Adam owns a real estate business with two employees. The business is still operating at this stage but  Adam expects that turnover will decline by more than 30 per cent in in the coming months. The  employees are:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Anne, who is a permanent full-time employee on a salary of $3,000 per fortnight before tax and  who continues working for the business; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Nick, who is a permanent part-time employee on a salary of $1,000 per fortnight before tax and  who continues working for the business.

Adam is eligible to receive the JobKeeper Payment for each employee, which would have the following  benefits for the business and its employees:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The business continues to pay Anne her full-time salary of $3,000 per fortnight before tax, and the  business will receive $1,500 per fortnight from the JobKeeper Payment to subsidise the cost of  Anne’s salary and will continue paying the superannuation guarantee on Anne’s income;

Last updated: 30 March 2020 3

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The business continues to pay Nick his $1,000 per fortnight before tax salary and an additional  $500 per fortnight before tax, totalling $1,500 per fortnight before tax. The business receives  $1,500 per fortnight before tax from the JobKeeper Payment which will subsidise the cost of Nick’s  salary. The business must continue to pay the superannuation guarantee on the  $1,000 per fortnight of wages that Nick is earning. The business has the option of choosing to pay  superannuation on the additional $500 (before tax) paid to Nick under the JobKeeper Payment.

Adam can register his initial interest in the scheme from 30 March 2020, followed subsequently by an  application to ATO with details about his eligible employees. In addition, Adam is required to advise his  employees that he has nominated them as eligible employees to receive the payment. Adam will provide  information to the ATO on a monthly basis and receive the payment monthly in arrears.

Employer with employees who have been stood down without pay

Zahrah runs a beauty salon in Melbourne. Ordinarily, she employs three permanent part-time  beauticians, but the government directive that beauty salons can no longer operate has required her to  shut the business. As such she has been forced to stand down her three beauticians without pay.

Zahrah’s turnover will decline by more than 30 per cent, so she is eligible to apply for the JobKeeper  Payment for each employee, and pass on $1,500 per fortnight before tax to each of her three beauticians  for up to six months. Zahrah will maintain the connection to her employees, and be in a position to  quickly resume her operations.

Zahrah is required to advise her employees that she has nominated them as eligible employees to  receive the payment. It is up to Zahrah whether she wants to pay superannuation on the additional  income paid because of the JobKeeper Payment.

If Zahrah’s employees have already started receiving income support payments like the JobSeeker  Payment when they receive the JobKeeper Payment, they should advise Services Australia of their  change in circumstances online at my.gov.au or by telephone.



JobKeeper Payment — Information for employees

Last updated: 30 March 2020

ECONOMIC RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS

EMPLOYEE OBLIGATIONS

Employees will receive a notification from their employer that they are receiving the JobKeeper Payment.  The majority of employees will need to do nothing further.

Employees in the following circumstances will have additional obligations.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Employees that have multiple employers must notify the employer that is their primary employer.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Employees that are not Australian citizens must notify their employer of their visa status, to allow  their employer to determine if they are an eligible employee.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Employees that are currently in receipt of an income support payment should advise Services  Australia of their change in circumstances online at my.gov.au or by telephone.

BACKGROUND ON JOBKEEPER PAYMENT FOR EMPLOYEES

Under the JobKeeper Payment, businesses impacted by the Coronavirus will be able to access a wage  subsidy from the Government to continue paying their employees. Affected employers will be able to claim  a fortnightly payment of $1,500 per eligible employee from 30 March 2020, for a maximum of 6 months.

Eligible employees will receive a minimum of $1,500 per fortnight, before tax. It will be up to the employer  if they want to pay superannuation on any additional wage paid because of JobKeeper Payments.

Eligible employees include Australian citizens, the holder of a permanent visa, a Protected Special Category  Visa Holder, a non-protected Special Category Visa Holder who has been residing continually in Australia for  10 years or more, or a Special Category (Subclass 444) Visa Holder.

Full time and part time employees, including stood down employees, would be eligible for the JobKeeper  Payment. Where a casual employee has been with their employer for at least the previous 12 months they  will also be eligible for the Payment.

Employees will be able to receive this payment in a number of different ways.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If you ordinarily receive $1,500 or more in income per fortnight before tax, you will continue to  receive your regular income according to the prevailing workplace arrangements. The JobKeeper  Payments will subsidise part or all of your income.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If you ordinarily receive less than $1,500 in income per fortnight before tax, your employer must pay  you, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight, before tax.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If you have been stood down, your employer must pay you, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight,  before tax.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If you were employed on 1 March 2020, subsequently ceased employment and then were re-engaged  by the same eligible employer, you will receive, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight, before tax.

Your employer will notify you if they are claiming the JobKeeper Payment on your behalf.

Employee who has been stood down and applied for income support

Phoebe works in administration services of a large retail company as a permanent full-time employee,  but she has been stood down under the Fair Work Act without pay. Phoebe had registered an intent to  claim with Services Australia for access to the JobSeeker Payment and the Coronavirus Supplement.  Phoebe is single, with no children and in total she would be eligible to receive $1,124.50 before tax  per fortnight from Services Australia.

Phoebe’s employer has decided to apply for the JobKeeper Payment for all its eligible employees for up  to six months. This would entitle Phoebe to $1,500 per fortnight before tax. Phoebe’s employer is  required to advise her that she has been nominated as an eligible employee to receive the payment.

If Phoebe elects to receive income support though Services Australia, she should advise Services  Australia of the change in her circumstances. Phoebe may no longer be eligible for income support from  Services Australia as a result of receiving the JobKeeper Payment.



Economic Response to the Coronavirus

Last updated: 30 March 2020

The Government is acting decisively in the national interest to support  households and businesses and address the significant economic consequences  of the Coronavirus.

While the full economic effects from the virus remain uncertain, the global and  domestic outlook has deteriorated since the Government’s initial Economic  Response announced on 12 March 2020.

The spread of the virus worldwide has broadened and is expected to be more  prolonged. Governments, both international and domestic, have announced  stricter mitigation measures to slow the spread of the virus, which are having  significant economic impacts.

Today we announce the introduction of a JobKeeper Payment which, combined  with our previous actions, total $320 billion across the forward estimates,  representing 16.4 per cent of annual GDP.

These actions provide timely support to affected workers, businesses and the  broader community.

HOW THE CORONAVIRUS WILL AFFECT THE GLOBAL AND AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIES

The outbreak of the virus has expanded and is a rapidly evolving challenge with significant health impacts.  While the outbreak originated in China, significant outbreaks have occurred in Italy, Spain and Iran, as well  as elsewhere in Europe and the United States. There are more than 190 countries reporting infections.

Our health system is well prepared to manage this outbreak. We have a world-class health system which  has pandemic plans that are currently activated. The Government has put in place strong measures to  protect Australians, including activating the National Incident Room, releasing masks and other Personal  Protective Equipment from the National Medical Stockpile, enhancing border controls and imposing strict  travel restrictions, and promoting social distancing to limit the spread. The Government will continue to  respond as the situation develops.

The Government’s commitment of $3.6 billion to manage the outbreak in Australia will strengthen our  health system to manage the Coronavirus in the community and protect vulnerable Australians. In addition,  the Australian Government has agreed with the States and the Territories to share the public health costs  incurred by the States in treating the Coronavirus.

In relation to aged care, temporary measures will be introduced to support the aged care sector with an  additional $444.6 million. This includes funding for a retention bonus to ensure the continuity of the  workforce in both residential and home care as well as funding to support the viability of residential aged  care facilities. This is in addition to more than $100 million that the Government previously announced to  support the aged care workforce.

The Coronavirus outbreak not only affects people’s health. The virus, along with the increasing health  measures to slow its spread, will have significant economic implications.

The international economic outlook has worsened as the Coronavirus has spread.

While the initial economic impact of the outbreak was most significantly felt in the Chinese economy, this  has quickly evolved to other countries and regions. Major economies including the UK, Italy and Spain have

Last updated: 30 March 2020 2

announced they are in “lockdown” to contain the Coronavirus, which is expected to hinder economic  activity over coming months.

In China, a range of economic indicators are showing that the Chinese economy has been severely  impacted. A survey measure of activity in the manufacturing sector had its largest fall in its history in  February. China also had record falls for industrial production, retail sales and fixed asset investment over  January and February. Trade for this period was also significantly affected.

Given China’s interconnectedness with the world, and its key role in supply chains, this decline will have  flow-on economic impacts for the world. But concerns about flow-on effects have been magnified as more  countries take direct action to slow the Coronavirus spread. In particular, across the world we have seen a  substantial increase in the breadth and severity of restrictions on the movement of people. And this is  showing up in confidence indicators in Europe, the United States and Asia.

The global nature of the shock is evident in financial markets. Stock markets have fallen substantially  around the world in recent weeks, while corporate bond spreads have widened. The Australian dollar is  11 per cent lower on a trade-weighted basis than it was in early January.

While markets initially incorporated sharp downward revisions to the economic outlook in an orderly way  with few signs of dislocation, more recently we have seen significant financial market strains. Financial  authorities around the world have responded with a range of measures to support market functioning and  economic activity.

Oil prices have continued to fall, and are now around 65 per cent lower than prices in early January,  reflecting falling global demand and the collapse of an agreement between major producers to reduce  output. While oil-linked LNG export prices will be negatively affected by these falls, consumers will benefit  from lower petrol and gas prices.

In contrast, prices of key bulk commodities have remained resilient to date. This is likely due to an  expectation that the Chinese authorities will move to boost domestic demand through ongoing measures,  including increased investment in infrastructure.

In response to the Coronavirus outbreak, fiscal authorities in numerous countries have announced  measures to support their health systems and their economies. Governments are supporting the sectors  and workers most affected by the outbreak, and we are continuing to see the announcement of policies to  help households and businesses cope as unprecedented shut-downs occur. Such policies have included  loan arrangements, tax deferrals and relief, cash payments and income support. Monetary policy is also  responding with around 70 central banks across the world easing policy in 2020 so far.

Australia’s position heading into this crisis is stronger than many, with both the IMF and the OECD having  forecast Australia to grow faster than comparable economies, including the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany  and France.

Australian governments continue to act quickly and decisively to adjust our health measures to the scale of  the threat. This scaling up of measures to protect the health of our community will have negative effects on  the economy. Demand for goods and services will be lowered, and this will be concentrated in some  industries such as tourism, hospitality and retail trade. Some businesses will be unable to operate in the  usual way owing to restrictions on large gatherings, or may face labour or supply chain challenges.

There remains considerable uncertainty around the economic implications of the Coronavirus for the June  quarter and beyond, but the economic shock will be significant. There are a wide range of potential paths  for the spread and containment of the virus globally and in Australia. In addition, there is uncertainty  around the impact on confidence, people’s ability to work and business cash flow. The global spread of the  Coronavirus and its global economic impact will also flow through to demand for Australia’s exports and  the availability of inputs into domestic production and imported consumption goods.

There are automatic mechanisms that will help to support activity. The flexible exchange rate helps to  mitigate the effect of shocks to global demand, we have a sound and well-capitalised banking sector and  our labour market has shown that it can flexibly respond — with firms adjusting more through hours, than  the number of employees.

HOW THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONDING

The Government’s consolidated package of $320 billion represents fiscal and balance sheet support across  the forward estimates of 16.4 per cent of annual GDP. The support is designed to help businesses and  households through the period ahead. This significant action has been taken in the national interest and  has been updated in the light of the broader and more prolonged impact of the Coronavirus outbreak.

The package provides timely support to workers, households and businesses through a difficult time.  Building on the previous measures, this package will support those most severely affected. It is also  designed to position the Australian economy to recover strongly once the health challenge has been  overcome.

The IMF and OECD have indicated that Australia is one of the advanced economies in the best positions to  provide fiscal support without endangering debt sustainability.

SUMMARY OF THE ECONOMIC RESPONSE

The Government’s economic response will support households and business through the period ahead. It is  designed to support businesses in managing short-term cash flow challenges, provide support to  individuals, severely affected communities and regions, to ensure the continued flow of credit in the  Australian economy and to ensure that employers can maintain connections with employees during this  difficult period.

1.  Support for individuals and households

The Government is providing financial assistance to Australians to support them through the economic  impact of the Coronavirus. This assistance includes the JobKeeper Payment income support payments,  payments to support households and temporary early releases of superannuation.

JobKeeper Payment

The JobKeeper Payment helps businesses significantly impacted by the Coronavirus cover the costs of  their employees’ wages, so more Australians can retain their jobs and continue to earn an income.  Employers will notify employees if they are claiming the fortnightly payment of $1,500. Please see the  Supporting businesses to retain jobs fact sheet for more information on this measure.

Income support for individuals

Over the next six months, the Government is temporarily expanding eligibility to income support  payments and establishing a new, time-limited Coronavirus supplement to be paid at a rate of  $550 per fortnight on top of their existing income support payment. This will be paid to both existing  and new recipients of Jobseeker Payment, Youth Allowance, Parenting Payment, Austudy, ABSTUDY  Living Allowance, Farm Household Allowance and Special Benefit. The Government is also temporarily  expanding access for the JobSeeker Payment by relaxing the partner income test.

Payments to support households

The Government is providing two separate $750 payments to social security, veteran and other  income support recipients and eligible concession card holders. The first payment will be made from  31 March 2020 and the second payment will be made from 13 July 2020. Around half of those that  benefit are pensioners. These payments will help to support confidence and domestic demand in the  economy. The second payment will not be made to those eligible for the Coronavirus supplement.

Last updated: 30 March 2020 4

Recognising that many Australians have saved over their lives to support themselves in retirement, the  Government is implementing two measures to support retirees in managing the impact of recent volatility  in financial markets and the impact of low interest rates on their retirement savings.

Temporary early release of superannuation

The Government is allowing individuals affected by the Coronavirus to access up to $10,000 of their  superannuation in 2019-20 and a further $10,000 in 2020-21. Individuals will not need to pay tax on  amounts released and the money they withdraw will not affect Centrelink or Veterans’ Affairs  payments.

Temporarily reducing superannuation minimum drawdown rates

The Government is temporarily reducing superannuation minimum drawdown requirements for  account-based pensions and similar products by 50 per cent for 2019-20 and 2020-21. This measure  will benefit retirees with account-based pensions and similar products by reducing the need to sell  investment assets to fund minimum drawdown requirements.

Reducing social security deeming rates

On 12 March, the Government announced a 0.5 percentage point reduction in both the upper and  lower social security deeming rates. The Government will now reduce these rates by another  0.25 percentage points.

As of 1 May 2020, the upper deeming rate will be 2.25 per cent and the lower deeming rate will be  0.25 per cent. The reductions reflect the low interest rate environment and its impact on the income  from savings. The change will benefit around 900,000 income support recipients, including around  565,000 Age Pensioners who will, on average receive around $105 more of the Age Pension in the first  full year the reduced rates apply.

2. Support for businesses

JobKeeper Payment

On 30 March 2020, the Government announced the JobKeeper Payment for eligible businesses, which  may include sole traders, whose turnover had reduced by more than 30 per cent if they have a  turnover of less than $1 billion or by more than 50 per cent if they have a turnover of more than  $1 billion. Businesses subject to the Major Bank Levy will not be eligible. Following registration by the  eligible business, the Government will provide $1,500 per fortnight per eligible employee for a  maximum of 6 months. This will support employers to maintain their connection with employees.  Please see the Supporting businesses to retain jobs fact sheet for more information on this measure.

Boosting Cash Flow for Employers

The Government is providing temporary cash flow support to small and medium businesses and  not for profit (NFP) organisations that employ staff during the economic downturn associated with  COVID-19 (novel coronavirus). This will be done through two sets of cash flow boosts delivered from  28 April 2020 to support employers to retain employees.

The Government will provide tax-free cash flow boosts of between $20,000 and $100,000 to eligible  businesses, delivered through credits in the activity statement system, when eligible businesses lodge  their activity statements.

Small and medium-sized business entities with aggregated annual turnover under $50 million and that  employ workers are eligible. NFPs, including charities, with aggregated annual turnover under  $50 million and that employ workers are also eligible. This will support employment at a time where  NFPs are facing increasing demand for services.

Last updated: 30 March 2020 5

Eligible businesses will receive initial payments in the March to July 2020 period. These payments will  be equal to 100 per cent of their employees’ salary and wages withheld. The minimum initial payment  is $10,000 and the maximum initial payment is $50,000.

Businesses who received initial cash flow boosts will receive additional cash flow boosts for the periods  June to September 2020, equal to the total amount of initial cash flow boosts received. This means  that eligible businesses that employ people will receive at least $20,000 up to a total of $100,000  under both payments. This additional payment continues cash flow support over a longer period,  increasing confidence, helping employers to retain staff and helping businesses to keep operating.

Please see the Cash flow assistance for businesses fact sheet for more information on this measure.

Temporary relief for financially distressed businesses

The economic impacts of the Coronavirus and health measures to prevent its spread will see many  otherwise profitable and viable businesses temporarily face financial distress. It is important that these  businesses have a safety net to make sure that when the crisis has passed they can resume normal  business operations. One element of that safety net is to lessen the threat of actions that could  unnecessarily push them into insolvency and force the winding up of the business.

The Government is temporarily increasing the threshold at which creditors can issue a statutory  demand on a company and to initiate bankrupt proceedings against an individual as well as  temporarily increasing the time companies and individuals have to respond to statutory demands they  receive. The package also includes temporary relief for directors from any personal liability for trading  while insolvent, and providing temporary flexibility in the Corporations Act 2001 to provide targeted  relief from provisions of the Act to deal with unforeseen events that arise as a result of the  Coronavirus health crisis.

The ATO will tailor solutions for owners or directors of business that are currently struggling due to the  Coronavirus, including temporary reduction of payments or deferrals, or withholding enforcement  actions including Director Penalty Notices and wind-ups.

Increasing the instant asset write-off

The Government is increasing the instant asset write-off threshold from $30,000 to $150,000 and  expanding access to include businesses with aggregated annual turnover of less than $500 million (up  from $50 million) until 30 June 2020. In 2017-18 there were more than 360,000 businesses that  benefited from the current instant asset write-off, claiming deductions to the value of over $4 billion.  This measure will support over 3.5 million businesses (over 99 per cent of businesses) employing more  than 9.7 million employees.

Backing business investment

The Government is introducing a time-limited 15 month investment incentive (through to  30 June 2021) to support business investment and economic growth over the short term, by  accelerating depreciation deductions. Businesses with a turnover of less than $500 million will be able  to deduct 50 per cent of the cost of an eligible asset on installation, with existing depreciation rules  applying to the balance of the asset’s cost. This measure will support business investment and is  estimated to lower taxes paid by Australian businesses by $6.7 billion over the next two years. This  measure will support over 3.5 million businesses (over 99 per cent of businesses) employing more than  9.7 million employees.

Supporting apprentices and trainees

The Government is supporting small business to retain their apprentices and trainees. Eligible  employers can apply for a wage subsidy of 50 per cent of the apprentice’s or trainee’s wage for  9 months from 1 January 2020 to 30 September 2020. Where a small business is not able to retain an  apprentice, the subsidy will be available to a new employer that employs that apprentice. Employers  will be reimbursed up to a maximum of $21,000 per eligible apprentice or trainee ($7,000 per quarter).

Last updated: 30 March 2020 6

Support will also be provided to the National Apprentice Employment Network, the peak national  body representing Group Training Organisations, to co-ordinate the re-employment of displaced  apprentices and trainees throughout their network of host employers across Australia.

This measure will support up to 70,000 small businesses, employing around 117,000 apprentices.

Support for Coronavirus-affected regions and communities

The Government will set aside $1 billion to support regions most significantly affected by the  Coronavirus outbreak. These funds will be available to assist during the outbreak and the recovery. In  addition, the Government is assisting our airline industry by providing relief from a number of taxes  and Government charges estimated to total up to $715 million.

3. Supporting the flow of credit

The Government, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority have  taken coordinated action to ensure the flow of credit in the Australian economy. Timely access to credit is  vital for businesses to manage the impacts of the Coronavirus.

Support for immediate cash flow needs for SMEs

Under the Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme, the Government will provide a guarantee of  50 per cent to SME lenders to support new short-term unsecured loans to SMEs. The Scheme will  guarantee up to $40 billion of new lending. This will provide businesses with funding to meet cash  flow needs, by further enhancing lenders’ willingness and ability to provide credit. This will assist  otherwise viable businesses across the economy who are facing significant challenges due to  disrupted cash flow to meet existing obligations.

Quick and efficient access to credit for small business

The Government is cutting red tape by providing a temporary exemption from responsible lending  obligations for lenders providing credit to existing small business customers. This reform will help  small businesses get access to credit quickly and efficiently.

Reserve Bank of Australia — Supporting the flow and reducing the cost of credit

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announced a package on 19 March 2020 that will put  downward pressure on borrowing costs for households and businesses. This will help mitigate the  adverse consequences of the Coronavirus on businesses and support their day-to-day trading  operations. The RBA is supporting small businesses as a particular priority.

The RBA announced a term funding facility for the banking system. Banks will have access to at  least $90 billion in funding at a fixed interest rate of 0.25 per cent. This will reinforce the benefits of  a lower cash rate by reducing funding costs for banks, which in turn will help reduce interest rates  for borrowers. To encourage lending to businesses, the facility offers additional low-cost funding to

banks if they expand their business lending, with particular incentives applying to new loans to  SMEs.

In addition, the RBA announced a further easing in monetary policy by reducing the cash rate to  0.25 per cent. It is also extending and complementing the interest rate cut by taking active steps to  target a 0.25 per cent yield on 3-year Australian Government Securities.

Support for Non-ADI and smaller ADI lenders in the securitisation market

The Government is providing the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) with  $15 billion to invest in structured finance markets used by smaller lenders, including  non-Authorised Deposit-Taking Institutions (non-ADI) and smaller Authorised Deposit-Taking  Institutions (ADI). This support will be provided by making direct investments in primary market  securitisations by these lenders and in warehouse facilities.

Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority — Ensuring banks are well placed to lend

The Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority has announced temporary changes to its  expectations regarding bank capital ratios. The changes will support banks’ lending to customers,  particularly if they wish to take advantage of the new facility being offered by the RBA.
