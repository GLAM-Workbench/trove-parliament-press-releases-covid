Tabling of report: Regulation of auditing inquiry



Today, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services has tabled its

final report on the regulation of auditing in Australia.



In the final report, the committee reaffirms all of the recommendations from the interim report in

February 2020, whilst acknowledging the significant economic shock that has occurred due to

COVID-19. No further evidence since the interim report has been presented to the committee to

contradict its earlier findings.



The economic headwinds of 2020 have demonstrated the need for an independent and accurate

auditing industry and highlighted the importance of a clear regulatory framework that supports that

objective. The committee welcomes the progress already made by the auditing industry in

response to its interim report despite the difficult economic conditions and disruption to normal

work practices for health reasons.



The committeeâ€™s final report recognises that the implementation of its recommendations should be

carefully considered by the government in light of the new economic climate.



Timelines and thresholds for implementation of the recommendations will need to be examined to

ensure that they are realistic, achievable and do not distract businesses or the auditing industry

from their most important focus of saving jobs and growing on the other side of the crisis. This

particularly applies to recommendation 7 on tendering for audit firms and recommendation 9

regarding internal controls frameworks for financial reporting.
