Queensland Government has to stump up for Rex

The Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management and Member for  Maranoa David Littleproud has written to the Queensland Premier to call on her to show  leadership and sit down with Rex Airlines to work out a solution to keep air services going  in Queensland.

These services provide medical prescriptions, goods and passengers to and from remote  areas of Queensland and are vital to their survival.

The Queensland Government is asking Rex to continue normal scheduled flights, when no  one is using them due to COVID-19, at a great loss to both Rex and the Queensland  Government.

It just doesn’t make sense that a government would make a company and its own  taxpayers pay for something that isn’t utilised when it could reduce the number of flights on  its schedule and maintain a vital service.

Minister Littleproud said that on the weekend the Federal Government committed  hundreds of millions of dollars to keep the core air routes across the country open.

“I urge the Queensland Government to talk to Regional Express to find a way to keep  those air links open”, Minister Littleproud said.

“The people in remote towns like Birdsville and Bedourie need access to medicine and  medical services.

“The communities of Charleville and Cunnamulla should have the right to the same  essential services as those in Brisbane.

“This is not an inconvenience, this is dangerous.

“The State Government has got to find some way of keeping Rex in the air and keeping  regional and rural Queenslanders safe.”
