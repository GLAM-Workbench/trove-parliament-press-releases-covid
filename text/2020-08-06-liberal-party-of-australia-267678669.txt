AUSTRALIA’S 2020 CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY

Keeping Australians secure online is key to protecting our economy, national security and  sovereignty.

The Morrison Government’s 2020 Cyber Security Strategy outlines how we will keep Australian  families and businesses secure online, protect and strengthen the security and resilience of  Australia’s critical infrastructure and ensure law enforcement agencies have the powers and  technical capabilities to detect, target, investigate and disrupt cybercrime, including on the dark  web.

The 2020 Cyber Security Strategy is the largest ever Australian Government financial  commitment to cyber security and builds on the strong foundations established by its  predecessor.

The Strategy invests $1.67 billion to build new cybersecurity and law enforcement capabilities,  protect the essential services upon which we all depend, assist businesses to protect  themselves and raise the community’s understanding of how to be secure online.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the role of the Australian Government is to keep  Australian’s safe, and it is important now, more than ever to protect Australians online from  those who seek to do us harm.

“The 2020 Strategy means that cyber security is a fundamental part of everyday life, so  Australians can reap the benefits of the internet and the digital economy safely, and with  confidence,” the Prime Minister said.

“The digital economy is the future of Australia’s economy. This has been demonstrated by the  coronavirus pandemic. We are seeing how much Australian’s are interacting online - for work,  healthcare, education, entertainment and shopping.

“We want to enlist all Australians in the fight to create a more cyber safe Australia - you are our  secret weapon in our cyber security strategy. And we want to give you the tools to protect your  family and your business.

“We will protect our vital infrastructure and services from cyber attacks. We will support  businesses to protect themselves so they can succeed in the digital economy.

We will track criminals in the darkest corners of the internet to protect our families and  children.”

The Government is determined to disrupt the serious criminal activity saturating the dark web.

The Government will introduce legislation to bolster the powers of the Australian Federal Police  and Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission to identify individuals and their networks  engaging in serious criminal activity on the dark web.

Powers that allow offensive disruption capabilities will allow law enforcement to take the fight  to the digital frontdoor of those using anonymising technology for evil purposes.

The Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton said the protection of children and the Australian  community from reprehensible criminal activity remains the Government’s highest priority.

“Paedophiles are targeting kids on line in chat groups. Cyber criminals are scamming money off  our elderly by stealing their internet banking details and businesses are being locked out of  their systems by ransomware attacks,” Mr Dutton said.

“Families and businesses are all spending more time working and studying online and we need  to make it safer. They are stealing the identities and data from unsuspecting Australians.

“We will continue to ensure agencies have the powers and capabilities they need to identify  and disrupt threats to the safety of Australians - particularly children, the most vulnerable  members of our community.”

Not all cyber security risks can be addressed by government. The strategy outlines steps  businesses of all sizes can take to protect themselves and their customers.

To support improved cyber security in the community, the Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Expand our efforts to raise awareness of cyber security threats and drive uptake of safe  and secure online behaviours across the community;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Expand our 24/7 cyber security advice hotline for families and older Australians;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Increase funding for victim support; and   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Introduce a voluntary Internet of Things Code of Practice to help consumers make  informed purchasing decisions.

Improving the security and resilience of critical infrastructure entities is crucial to protecting our  economy, security, and sovereignty.

We are introducing a security framework to bolster the nation’s resilience and ensure we can  act quickly in an emergency. The framework includes security obligations for critical  infrastructure providers and Government assistance to industry in response to immediate and  serious cyber attacks on Australia’s most critical systems.

Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton said reforms to strengthen the security and resilience of  Australia’s critical infrastructure would significantly boost Australia’s ability to deter, prevent  and respond to the most significant cyber attacks.

“The Government will work with owners and operators of critical infrastructure to update  legislation to ensure that critical infrastructure sectors deliver their essential services with  security front of mind,” Mr Dutton said.

“Agencies will be equipped to help address sophisticated threats, particularly to the essential  services all Australian’s rely on - everything from electricity and water, to healthcare and  groceries.

The Strategy has been informed by extensive community consultation and expert advice from  Government’s Industry Advisory Panel, chaired by Telstra CEO Andy Penn.
