Greens call on Treasurer to support the not-for-profit and community sector

The Australian Greens have written to Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, calling for a $2 billion investment in the not-for-profit and community sector as Australia faces the continuing health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

Quotes attributable to Senator Rachel Siewert, Greens spokesperson for Family, Ageing and Community Services:

“If not-for-profits and community organisations are forced to close, disabled and vulnerable people will have nowhere to turn. It is critical that they are supported.

“These organisations are the backbone of our community. Childcare, disability, community and aged care services are at the front-line of Australia’s response to this crisis. They need funding certainty to continue to play their vital role.

“As Australia weathers the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, these organisations are more important than ever. The Treasurer needs to commit additional funding to keep them operating.”

Quotes attributable to Adam Bandt MP, Leader of the Australian Greens:

“If the government wants to stimulate the economy and protect the wellbeing of some of the most vulnerable in our community, they should be investing in the not-for-profit and community sectors.

“Over 10% of the Australian workforce is employed by the not-for-profit and community sector. The government needs to protect this sector by investing at least $2 billion now.

“The Treasurer has made a commitment to stimulating the economy and keeping Australians in work. If he is serious about making this a reality he needs to use the next stimulus package to support the not-for-profit and community sector."
