VIRTUAL SUMMIT WITH THE   PRIME MINISTER OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE



I am pleased to announce that I will be joining His Excellency Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister of the  Republic of Singapore, for a Virtual Summit on 23 March 2020.

I had invited Prime Minister Lee to visit Canberra as a Guest of Government, but due to the unfolding  situation globally we will instead meet virtually.

Australia and Singapore both have advanced, sophisticated and technology-enabled economies. We  have a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and our bilateral relationship continues to advance into  new areas, including the digital economy.

We are both strongly committed to continuing the business of government at this time, and I look  forward to discussing our countries’ responses to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic - a global  challenge that will only be addressed through countries working together.

We will also announce new bilateral initiatives in the digital economy and military training.

Australia and Singapore are bound together by shared values and common interests in regional  resilience, stability and prosperity. My Virtual Summit with Prime Minister Lee will be an important  opportunity to expand our cooperation and work to support an open, rules-based and prosperous global  environment.
