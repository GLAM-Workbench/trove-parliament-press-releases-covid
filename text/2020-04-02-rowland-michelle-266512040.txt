AFFIRMING THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONS  SERVICES

As COVID-19 restrictions tighten around Australia, it is incumbent upon  Federal, State and Territory Ministers to ensure media and communications  services continue to be recognised as an essential service.

Media and communications services are essential for keeping Australians  connected and informed, yet key sectors remain deeply uncertain as to whether  they will be permitted to continue to carry out this critical role during the  Coronavirus crisis.

As extraordinary powers are invoked, government advice is updated daily and  the health of the Australian public is at stake, the publicâ€™s right to know has  never been more important. It is essential the Australian people can continue to  access trusted sources of news and information.

Media outlets already face unprecedented challenges. Even before this crisis  began, media freedom in Australia was under threat.

As this unprecedented crisis escalates, it is imperative that Federal, State and  Territory Ministers affirm the essential role of media and communications  services and key personnel across the print media, radio and TV broadcasters  - including national, community, commercial and subscription services - ISPs,  telcos and postal services.

Industry is putting practical measures and mechanisms in place, such as  allowing staff to work remotely, and providing employer letters or other  documentation, to help key personnel carry on their work unhindered but there



is no assurance this will satisfy authorities.

There is a great deal of uncertainty across the media and communications  industry and every effort should be made to clarify the state of play for essential  services where possible.
