SUBJECTS: Right-wing extremism on our shores; Home Affairs still without a Chief

Medical Officer; Scott Morrison’s failure to deliver on border security.



LAURA JAYES, HOST: Kristina Keneally, the Shadow Home Affairs Minister, joins me live

now from Canberra. Thanks so much your time. It’s quite concerning these figures. We’ve

heard from them from ASIO, they were repeated here yesterday by Mike Pezzullo. How

concerned are you?



SENATOR KRISTINA KENEALLY, SHADOW MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS: Laura,

Labor successfully forced the Government last December to refer an Inquiry into right-wing

extremism to the Intelligence and Security Committee. And we did that because this is a

growing and real threat in Australia. And while the Home Affairs Secretary is correct to point to

the US Capitol siege, and the development of and the growth of right-wing extremism

overseas, we shouldn't kid ourselves that this hasn't been a problem in Australia and that it has

only arrived recently. This has been a growing problem in this country, we have not yet had a

proper conversation about the extent to which Brenton Tarrant, the Christchurch shooter, an

Australian, was radicalised in this country. And yet we know from the Royal Commission in

New Zealand, into the Christchurch shootings, that they found that it was right wing extremist

views and voices in Australia that radicalised Brenton Tarrant. So this is a problem that has

been a growing national security threat. ASIO has been upfront with the community to say that

this is a serious national security threat. And yet Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton have

downplayed, dismissed and sought to ignore this growing national security threat. That is why

Labor successfully pushed for this Inquiry and it is taking submissions now.



JAYES: Are they ignoring it? Or are they just dealing with this quietly? Should it be done more

quietly? Or do you think it needs to be vented, if you like...



KENEALLY: Laura, one of the best ways we build a safe community is to talk to the Australian

people about the threats that we face, enlist their help in making us a safer country. That's

what we've done with Islamic extremism. We have worked with the Islamic community. And

that has been quite a successful strategy. We are not doing the same when it comes to right-wing extremism. We need to be talking to parents and teachers and coaches. We need to be

giving people information about the types of groups that are out there, the types of views that

they are pushing, we need to be helping people know where to refer when they are concerned

about a young person. And they're primarily young people who are being targeted here - young

males - when they are heading down an extremist path. And Laura, when it comes to right

wing extremism, we cannot give in and do what they want us to do what the right-wing

extremists want us to do, which is to do nothing. They want governments to stand by quietly

and let them grow in number and influence.



JAYES: We'll we've seen that in the United States, which you just touched on and groups like

QAnon and Proud Boys, among others, are the ones that marched on the U.S. Capitol. At the

centre of those groups is misinformation and conspiracies. Is there any evidence that those

groups are having influence here?



KENEALLY: Laura, there is. We are in Australia, the only Five Eyes country that has not listed

any right-wing extremist groups is terrorist organisations. Yet there are terrorist organisations

proscribed in Canada and the United Kingdom that have direct links to right-wing extremist

groups here. They are sharing information online. They are, in fact we've got Australians who

have travelled overseas to do military training with right-wing extremist groups. And yet our

Government has not listed any of these groups; has not charged anyone under foreign fighters

legislation; has not declared any prohibited areas; and it is very murky or opaque to

understand how much of any of our countering violent extremism funding is directed at right-wing extremism. These are all the reasons that Labor has pushed so hard for an inquiry into

right-wing extremism. We need to ensure that our counterterrorism tools and the tools that we

have to keep the community safe - which have understandably been focused on Islamic

jihadism - we need to determine whether or not they are fit for purpose when it comes to right-wing extremism. Because, while there are some similarities between these types of extremism,

the motivating ideology matters and it matters in terms of how you prevent, how you de-radicalise and how you investigate this terrorist threat.



JAYES: Okay, the ABF it was revealed yesterday on this programme, and the Department

doesn’t have a Chief Medical Officer. Now we had the Home Affairs Department and indeed

the Secretary justify that yesterday. Do you accept that?



KENEALLY: Laura, we're in the middle of a global pandemic. And the agency that is tasked

with managing our borders in the middle of a global pandemic has left the Chief Medical

Officer position vacant for months. It's a dereliction of duty that sits directly at the feet of Peter

Dutton, the Minister for Home Affairs. Once again the Minister's incompetence is on display.

However, we've got a Commonwealth Government that suddenly seems to think the

international borders are not their responsibility. Scott Morrison has duck shoved it all on to the

States. I mean, Laura, you know, you and I are old enough to remember, because it was only

last year, when we had a Commonwealth Government that thought international borders and

quarantine were part of their responsibility. Quite frankly, if we are going to get a handle on two

problems, which we're going to have to live with here for some time to come. One is the fact

that people are going to need to have the confidence to cross the border and to do so safely

and in a way that keeps the Australian community safe from the risk of COVID outbreaks and

two to bring stranded Australians home, 40,000 stranded Australians the Prime Minister

promised would be home by Christmas, he has broken that promise. Now, if we're going to do

those two things, we need a federal Government to take leadership, to put together a national

quarantine facility, to have reliable and predictable ways for people to cross the border to come

home. And it is up to the Commonwealth Government to lead that work. Scott Morrison has

shown a lack of leadership here when it comes to our international borders.



JAYES: Okay. Kristina Keneally we will have to leave it there. Thanks.





KENEALLY: Thank you.
