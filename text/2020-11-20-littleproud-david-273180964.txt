BINNA BURRA RECONSTRUCTION WORKS COMPLETE

After severe bushfires swept through the world heritage-listed Binna Burra rainforest reserve in  September 2019, the Binna Burra Road reconstruction project is now complete.

The major road reconstruction marks an important recovery milestone for the community and local  tourism after last year's devastating bushfires.

Federal Minister for Emergency Management David Littleproud said while the impact of the fires had  been felt deeply by the local community, the completion of the project was a great result for the wider  area.

“The completion of the Binna Burra Road reconstruction project is an important step in boosting the  local economy as it recovers from both the bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic," Minister  Littleproud said.

“The Australian and Queensland Governments have been proud to jointly fund this $30.5 million  project through the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements.

“Natural disasters have hit Queensland hard in recent times, and this is another example of the  Australian Government working in partnership with local authorities to deliver assistance where it is  most needed.”

Transport and Main Roads Mark Bailey said that since the road reopening on 31 August, many new  and returning visitors had come back to this much-loved retreat in south east Queensland.

"As we have seen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and the many other natural disasters this  state has endured, Queenslanders are tough, resilient and optimistic,” Mr Bailey said.

“Queensland’s investment in projects such as this help underpin our economy and, importantly, our  local tourism sector as we deliver Queensland’s Economic Recovery Plan over the coming months.”

Mr Bailey said the 14-month reconstruction project to repair severe slope damage along Binna Burra  Road had been complex due to the steep terrain.

“It has been technically demanding work requiring specialist personnel and equipment to restore this  road, and I’d like to congratulate the project team on a job well done,” he said.

"We also thank the community for its patience while these critical reconstruction works were carried  out."

The reconstruction works involved installing slope stabilisation measures above and below the road,  including drape mesh and rock-fall protection above the road.

"Downslope work has involved installing large rock gabions (or rock-filled cages) and anchoring them  with long soil nails and rock anchors into the cliff face,” Mr Bailey said.

Other completed works include concrete channelling, laying new bitumen seal and asphalt, line  marking and installing signs.

Eligible reconstruction works are jointly funded by the Australian and Queensland Governments  under the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA).

Road restoration, drainage reinstatement, sealing, asphalt, some guardrail installation and line  marking are funded through the Queensland Transport Roads Investment Program (QTRIP).
