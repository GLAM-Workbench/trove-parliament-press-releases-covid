1.8 MILLION ON UNEMPLOYMENT PAYMENTS BY CHRISTMAS

NEW FIGURES SHOW



The number of people on unemployment payments will surge to 1.8 million by December,

an increase of 300,000 over previous projections, the Department of Social Services (DSS)

told a Senate estimates hearing today.



Senator Katy Gallagher, Shadow Minister for Finance: Are you still expecting - I think

when we met through the COVID-Committee - you were expecting 1.5 million people to be

on unemployment payments, JobSeeker and Youth Allowance (other), at the end of the

year? Does that remain your forecast?



DSS Official: …the current forecast for the quarter, second quarter 20/21, reflects an

average of 1.8 million.

It was also confirmed that the number of people forced to get by on unemployment

payments will be higher in 2024 than it was before the recession, with DSS projecting the

average number of people will be:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 1.3 million in 2021-22

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 1 million in 2022-23

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 900,000 in 2023-24

This compares to 813,000 people relying on unemployment payments in December 2019.



“These revised figures show this jobs crisis is getting worse, and the Government’s



planned Christmas JobSeeker cut will hurt 1.8 million Australians,” said Linda Burney,

Shadow Minister for Families and Social Services.



“Social security recipients spend at local and small businesses, sustaining local jobs.



“It is increasingly clear that the Government has no plan to create jobs, and the

Government’s planned Christmas JobSeeker cut risks losing more, making the recession

deeper and longer.



“Unemployment is painful and unfair - hundreds of thousands of Australians will bear the

impact of this recession for years to come.



“The Prime Minister needs to show compassion by announcing a permanent increase to

the JobSeeker Payment.”
