PORT BOTANY RAIL DUPLICATION TENDER PUTS JOBS ON  TRACK

Construction of the Port Botany rail line duplication between Mascot and Botany in New South  Wales is a step closer, with the design and construct tender package released today.

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development Michael  McCormack said the significant infrastructure project, led by the Australian Rail Track Corporation  (ARTC), would create much-needed local jobs while providing a long-term freight productivity boost.

“The Australian Government is fully funding the $400 million Botany Rail duplication and  accompanying Cabramatta Loop Project to allow more freight to be transported by rail through Port  Botany to meet Sydney’s future freight demand,” the Deputy Prime Minister said.

“The Botany Rail Duplication will upgrade and duplicate the current single freight rail track between  Mascot and Botany to increase the capacity of Sydney’s freight rail network while bolstering  operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability for freight customers.

“This will create more than 400 jobs during construction and provide a welcome boost to all the  hard-working local businesses who use the rail line to get their products to markets.

“We’re talking a wide range of local jobs - traffic controllers, track workers, labourers, security,  engineers and a number of tradies such as electricians, formwork carpenters, boiler makers and  plant mechanics will all be needed to deliver the new rail track and associated infrastructure.

“We know every single job we support makes a world of difference to that person, their family and  the entire community, which is why I am thrilled to see this project launch into the construction  phase - with this tender release to market paving the way for works to start next year.

“This a great example of how our record $100 billion nationwide investment in infrastructure is  creating local jobs and driving growth right when it’s needed most.”

Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said the project would help meet Australia’s growing freight  requirements and support local businesses while taking traffic off Sydney’s roads to make them safer  and less congested.



“COVID-19 has demonstrated the essential contribution of Australia’s freight industry and supply  chains, driving economic growth and opportunity by getting local goods to markets and keeping  shelves stocked,” Minister Cormann said.

“Australia’s freight requirements are set to grow significantly over the coming decades. While this is  great news for the industry and the Australian economy, it will place increasing pressure on our  roads.

“I look forward to this transformative project getting underway so that Sydney, New South Wales  and our national supply chain can reap the benefits.”

In late 2019, ARTC released an open invitation for Expressions of Interest and shortlisted three  construction contractors following a robust evaluation process.

Shortlisted companies that have been requested to submit formal tenders for the Botany Rail  Duplication works are:    Ã¯ÂÂ· CPB Contractors  Ã¯ÂÂ· Laing O’Rourke Construction Australia

Ã¯ÂÂ· John Holland

The tender for the Cabramatta Loop Project will be released later this year.
