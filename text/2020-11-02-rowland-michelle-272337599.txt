SHADOW MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS

MEMBER FOR GREENWAY



RESIGNATION OF THE AUSTRALIA POST CEO



The circumstances which have brought on the resignation of Australia Post

CEO are regrettable.



Scott Morrison mustered up all the confected outrage in the world about

$20,000 on watches, yet when his own Ministers rort taxpayers he turns a blind

eye.



The Australia Post Board is stacked with Liberal Party hacks and mates of

Scott Morrison. Even on their best day, you wouldnâ€™t call these Liberal directors

the C-team.



The decision to use COVID-19 as opportunistic cover to cut services, attack 1

in 4 postie jobs and increase delivery timeframes, was wholly ratified by the

Australia Post Board.



Anyone who thinks these issues will be resolved through a change of CEO is

kidding themselves. This Board must be cleaned out.



The Chairman has been asked to appear before a Senate Committee hearing

next week. If he again refuses to come, Labor will move for the Senate to



compel him.
