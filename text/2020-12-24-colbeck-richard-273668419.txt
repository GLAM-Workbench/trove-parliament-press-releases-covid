Support for senior Australians during the holiday season

Vital support services will ensure senior and vulnerable Australians can access the help they  need and stay connected during the holiday season.

Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services, Richard Colbeck, said after a difficult  year, the need for older Australians to stay connected was more important than ever.

“We know living with the pandemic has made life harder for many senior Australians,”  Minister Colbeck said.

“I would encourage as many people as possible to reach out to their older friends and family  members.

“Just a quick chat and acknowledgement can make a huge difference to somebody’s life at this  time of the year.”

The Australian Government has bolstered a range of resources to support the social connection,  mental health and wellbeing of senior Australians, including the Government’s free digital  mental health gateway, Head to Health.

These services include:

Ã¯ÂÂ· HeadtoHealth - www.headtohealth.gov.au   Ã¯ÂÂ· BeyondBlue (1800 512 348) - www.coronavirus.beyondblue.org.au     Ã¯ÂÂ· Lifeline (13 11 14) - www.lifeline.org.au   Ã¯ÂÂ· On the Line for the Suicide Call Back Service (1300 659 467)   Ã¯ÂÂ· Older Persons Advocacy Network (OPAN) - www.opan.com.au  Ã¯ÂÂ· Phoenix Australia - www.phoenixaustralia.org/aged-care

This includes practical advice and referrals to services that can ease their concerns about any  social isolation they may be experiencing, travel restrictions, access to new, or queries about  existing, home care services and other questions they may have about the COVID-19  pandemic.

“Senior Australians who are lonely or isolated over the holiday period can contact the Older  Persons Advocacy Network (OPAN),” Minister Colbeck said.

“OPAN is funded by the Government to deliver free, independent and confidential advocacy  support and information to older people, ensuring they are empowered to make informed  decisions about their care.”

Older Australians and their families and aged care staff who require grief, loss and bereavement  counselling can contract the Australian Centre for Grief and Bereavement has a free telephone  service available on 1800 22 22 00.

Phoenix Australia has tools to support those who have had traumatic experiences, as well as  trauma recovery resources for carers and aged care providers.”

In addition, a range of Australian Government funded dementia services will continue to be  available this holiday period to support people living with dementia and their carers.

Dementia Support Australia delivers the free Dementia Behaviours Management Advisory  Service (DBMAS) and Severe Behaviour Response Teams (SBRT).

These services can assist carers when behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia  are affecting a person’s care or quality of life. These programs are available 24 hours a day by  phoning 1800 699 799.

Dementia Australia delivers the National Dementia Support Program (NDSP) which includes  the National Dementia Helpline.

The Helpline is free and provides information and advice including caring for people living  with dementia and how families and carers can look after themselves.

The Helpline is available Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm (AEDT) by phoning 1800 100 500.  It will be closed on the following public holidays - 25 and 28 December 2020, 1 and 26 January  2021.

“Dementia is one of the nation’s greatest health challenges,” Minister Colbeck said.  “That’s  why the Australian Government is committed to supporting these important programs and  provides more than $50 million each year to fund a number of these services.”
