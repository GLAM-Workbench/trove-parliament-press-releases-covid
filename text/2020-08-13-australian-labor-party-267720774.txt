WE NEED COVID-19 COMMUNICATIONS GRANTS FOR OUR  MULTICULTURAL COMMUNITIES

More translation errors in COVID-19 health information for multicultural communities are  undermining Australia’s response to the pandemic.

All Australians need accurate and clear public health information including the many  culturally and linguistically diverse communities who have made Australia their home.

If the Morrison Government doesn’t get this right, it risks undermining everyone’s efforts to  stop the spread of COVID-19.

Federal Labor is calling on the Morrison Government again to fund a $500,000 COVID-19  Communications Grant for multicultural communities so we can better use their networks  to effectively communicate vital information.

The grants would provide eligible providers and community leaders the resources to break  communication barriers within existing official health information - particularly leaders who  represent emerging communities during this public health emergency.

Labor has been raising concerns about COVID-19 communications with multicultural  communities since March. We want every communication barrier to be broken so the right  information reaches all communities.

We must ensure no one is left behind during this pandemic because a virus does not  check someone’s cultural background before it infects them.

The Morrison Government needs to better support multicultural communities and engage  with community leaders who represent emerging communities during this public health  emergency.

Labor is putting forward this constructive suggestion to help bring Australians together,  keep Australians safe, and ensure no Australians are left behind.
