MEDIA RELEASE

NUSHIP SUPPLY SHIP ACCEPTANCE

Defence’s contract with Spain’s Navantia S.A. has reached a major milestone with Ship Acceptance of the Royal Australian Navy’s First Supply-class vessel, NUSHIP Supply.

Minister for Defence, Senator the Hon Linda Reynolds CSC was pleased to announce the formal acceptance of the Auxiliary Oilier Replenishment (AOR) ship, NUSHIP Supply from Spanish shipbuilder, Navantia S.A.

“Despite the impacts of COVID-19, the Australian Government has worked with the prime and sub-contractors to innovate and implement solutions to deliver the Royal Australian Navy’s first Supply-class vessel Nuship Supply, based on the Spanish Cantabria design,” Minister Reynolds said.

“The Australian Government remains committed to maximising Australian industry involvement in the shipbuilding enterprise.

“Australian industry benefited with more than $130 million spent on engagement of local industry partners to support the ship’s fit out in Australia.”

With Australia’s current replenishment capability reaching its end of life in 2021, NUSHIP Supply will be the first AOR to replace the retired HMAS Success and bridge Navy’s current capability gap. NUSHIP Stalwart expected to enter service in late 2021.

The Australian Government signed contracts with Navantia S.A to build Australia’s two replacement auxiliary oiler replenishment (AOR) ships in May 2016.

NUSHIP Supply was launched in Ferrol, Spain, in November 2018 and arrived at HMAS Stirling, Garden Island Fleet Base West, Western Australia, on 2 October 2020 for final fit out and testing activities.

NUSHIP Supply is expected to sail into her homeport of Sydney next week.
