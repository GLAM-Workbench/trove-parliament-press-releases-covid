HURRY UP AND RELEASE DETAILS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOUSING



Domestic and family violence is the leading cause of homelessness for women and their

children.



This Homelessness Week, Labor is again calling on the Prime Minister to bring forward the

construction of additional accommodation for women and children escaping family

violence.



Accommodation is a critical factor in the decision whether to leave a violent relationship,

and right now there are significant delays in women seeking to leave domestic violence

shelters for more permanent homes.



A paper released by the Australian Institute of Criminology in July found an ‘escalation’ of

family violence during the coronavirus pandemic.



According to an article by the University of Melbourne, the COVID-19 crisis has “left many

victims of domestic and family abuse inside their homes with their abuser - all day, every



day - as people isolate to prevent the spread of the virus.”



Last month, Labor called on the Morrison Government to release the details of the $60

million grants program to expand emergency accommodation for women and children

experiencing family violence.



The funding was announced in March last year and, 16 months later, the government is yet

to confirm which organisations have received the grants.



On Monday, the Assistant Minister responsible for Homelessness said an announcement

will be made in the next month.



Hurry up. These projects should be under construction now.



The Morrison Government should also invest in the construction of more social housing.

This would create more work for tradies and help put a roof over the heads of women and

children escaping domestic violence.
