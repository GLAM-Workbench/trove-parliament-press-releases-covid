New Industry Advisory Committee to support the delivery of National Cyber Security priorities The Morrison Government has established an Industry Advisory Committee to help guide the implementation of Australia’s Cyber Security Strategy 2020 and provide ongoing advice about the best ways to address emerging cyber security challenges.

Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton said the Industry Advisory Committee, chaired by Telstra CEO Andrew Penn, will play an important role in delivering on the Government’s digital agenda, including our commitment to keeping Australians safe online.

“The 2020 Cyber Security Strategy is  rmly focused on protecting families and businesses, especially as they spend more time online both at home and in their workplaces”, Mr Dutton said.

“The Committee brings a wealth of experience from both the public and private sector that will build on the success of the Industry Advisory Panel and ensure industry will continue playing a vital formative role in shaping the delivery of actions set out in the Strategy.”

The Committee members are:

Andrew Penn, Industry Advisory Committee Chair, CEO of Telstra (former Chair of the Industry Advisory Panel)  Cathie Reid, Industry Advisory Committee Deputy Chair, Chair of AUCloud Darren Kane, Chief Security Ocer of NBN Co (former Industry Advisory Panel member) Chris Deeble AO CSC, Chief Executive of Northrop Grumman Australia (former Industry Advisory Panel member) Bevan Slattery, Chairman of FibreSense Corinne Best, Trust and Risk Business Leader of PricewaterhouseCoopers Australia

Mr Penn said connected technologies were at the heart of the lives of most Australians and would be central to the country’s post-COVID-19 recovery and long-term competitiveness.

“While our lives are increasingly connected by digital technologies more abundant and better resourced cyber-criminals and cyber-activists and increasingly sophisticated and emboldened state actors mean Australia is quite literally under constant cyber-attack,” Mr Penn said.

“Meeting that challenge requires Australia’s cyber defences to be strong, adaptive and built around a strategic framework that is coordinated, integrated and capable - the 2020 Cyber Security Strategy provides that framework.

“It is hard to imagine a more important piece of work and I am very proud to have been appointed chairman of the expert Industry Advisory Committee that will help bring it to life.”

The Industry Advisory Committee will provide advice to Government through regular meetings and report directly to the Minister for Home Affairs.
