AUSSIE INVENTION MILKING THE SHELF LIFE OF FRIDGE STAPLE

8 January 2021

The Morrison Government is backing a world-first innovation that can extend the  expiry date of fresh milk to more than 60 days.

Queensland company Naturo will use its $1 million Accelerating Commercialisation  grant to build a pilot manufacturing plant in Coolum for its world-first patented  technology for processing milk that is nutritionally superior and has a longer shelf life.

It’s among nine Australian businesses sharing in $4.4 million in matched grant  funding to expand their operations.

Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Karen Andrews said the Government  is helping companies such as Naturo that are pushing the boundaries of the  possible.

“I’m so impressed by the ingenuity and determination of Aussie businesses like  Naturo who are using science and technology to turn bold ideas into job-creating  realities,” Minister Andrews said.

“This grant will help the company build a pilot plant in Queensland to create their  product and then export it to the world, while also paving the way for a full scale  facility to be built in regional Tasmania.

“Through the commercialisation of innovative products and services like this we’re  also creating new jobs and giving a much needed boost to our economy as we  recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This project also demonstrates the incredible opportunities in the food and beverage  sector, which is why it’s one of the six priority areas under our Modern Manufacturing  Strategy.”
