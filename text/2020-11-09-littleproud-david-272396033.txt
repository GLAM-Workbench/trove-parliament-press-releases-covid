MOBILE SERVICE CENTRE ‘BLUE GUM’ MAKES ITS  DEBUT

The Australian Government has boosted support for rural and regional communities with a  new Mobile Service Centre, ‘Blue Gum’ hitting the road in Queensland.

Created in response to drought in 2006, Services Australia’s fleet of Mobile Service Centres  travel thousands of kilometres each year to provide tailored Centrelink, Medicare and Child  Support assistance to Australia’s rural and regional communities.

Minister for Government Services Stuart Robert said Blue Gum will further strengthen the  accessibility of government services to all Australians, regardless of where they live.

‘During a break for staff and customer safety during the pandemic, work continued behind  the scenes to make Mobile Service Centres better than ever,’ Minister Robert said.

‘This new truck has enhanced safety features, better fuel efficiency and significant  accessibility improvements.'

Member for Flynn Ken O’Dowd said Blue Gum was recently constructed in Brisbane and  named after the Tasmanian floral emblem.

‘Blue Gum was built by Varley, one of Australia’s oldest engineering and manufacturing  companies,’ Mr O’Dowd said.

‘As with all Mobile Service Centres, it has been purpose-built to replicate a service centre,  complete with the latest technology.’

Member for Maranoa David Littleproud said Queenslanders can access services in a COVID-safe manner.

‘A COVID safe plan has been implemented for the rollout of Blue Gum to ensure Mobile  Service Centres remain safe for all customers and staff,’ Mr Littleproud said.

‘Locals can visit the Mobile Service Centre to meet face to face with staff if they require  more personalised or intensive support, and staff can help them to complete most of their  Centrelink and Medicare business online.’
