COVID-19 crisis and that, if necessary, they will hold them to account.

this anxiety and there is now an urgent need for a dedicated strategy to the

COVID-19 crisis to ensure that disabled people are supported and protected.

Disability Health (CREDH) has called for comprehensive action plan to protect

disabled people which has been supported by Australia's peak disability
