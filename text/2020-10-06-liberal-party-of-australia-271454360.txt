Early learning and child care

Child care services are vital for so many parents and their children. In 2020-21, the  Government will pay approximately $9 billion in Child Care Subsidy payments. Due to the  means-tested nature of the subsidy, families who have lost income or work during the  COVID-19 pandemic and continue to use care will receive a higher level of subsidy.
