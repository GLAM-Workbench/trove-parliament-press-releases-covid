ABS FIGURES SEE CONSTRUCTION WORK PLUNGE



The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data released today shows signs of significant

weakness in the construction industry under the Morrison Government.



Construction work in the December quarter fell 3 per cent seasonally adjusted, to be down

7.4 per cent over the year, a major fall compared to last quarter.



Building construction work alone is down 4.1 per cent in the quarter and 7.1 per cent over

the year.



Dwelling construction remains weak, with new private residential construction declining 4.6

per cent in the quarter and is now 12.8 per cent down over the year.



The national construction industry is critical to the Australian economy, but this government

is failing to manage the many challenges it’s facing.



The weaknesses in the industry have not abated and yet the Morrison Government has no

plan whatsoever to deal with the significant structural issues facing the industry.



Like much of the Australian economy, construction and building growth was weak long

before the bushfires hit or anyone had heard of Coronavirus.





It’s high time the Morrison Government stopped navel-gazing and focussed on coming up

with a comprehensive plan to restore the economic and wages growth which has

deteriorated on its watch.
