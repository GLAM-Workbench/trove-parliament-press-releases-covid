PETER STEFANOVIC:

Well joining us live now out of Canberra is Peter Dutton the Minister for Home Affairs.  Peter, good to see you, thanks for joining us this morning. So police are suggesting that  online he was expressing some support for a mass casualty event here. I know we've got to  be careful with what we're saying because it's before the courts today, but it's very  troubling, isn't it?

PETER DUTTON:



Well good morning Pete, good to be on the show. Obviously it's very concerning and the  police have moved, as they do in some cases where they believe that pre-emptive strike is  the safest way to deal with a threat - like most other crime groups, an investigation takes  place - but in relation to terrorism related offences or allegations, the police generally have  to act pre-emptively - obviously before a strike takes place - and the joint work that's been  done here between the Australian Federal Police and New South Wales Joint Counter-  Terrorism Task Force is a credit to them. As you point out though, I mean people online are  reading propaganda, they are being influenced and we are concerned about that reality.

PETER STEFANOVIC:

We'll get to your inquiry in just a second, but it's interesting that the findings that emerged  from New Zealand this week, Minister, that the authorities in New Zealand could have done  more when it came to the Christchurch attacks and the belief is that intelligence agencies  should have been more focussed on white supremacism. So do you think that could have  been a factor here? That that can be a factor here now when police make the decision to go  early?

PETER DUTTON:



Pete, it's hard for me to comment on the New Zealand tragedy. Obviously everybody's 20-20 in hindsight. I can only speak from the Australian perspective and tell you that ASIO is an  amazing organisation. They've got higher levels of funding now than they ever have in their  history and we'll continue to make that investment.

We've introduced and passed 20 tranches of national security legislation to try and toughen  the laws - and that's on the advice of the agencies - but clearly we've got a very joined up  arrangement between the Commonwealth and the states and territories, as evidenced  yesterday in New South Wales, but as we've seen in the last couple of weeks when there  was an arrest in Bundaberg in Queensland and I'm absolutely confident that ASIO is doing  everything within their power to keep Australians safe.

Obviously they've been able to thwart a number of attacks, but equally their greatest fear is  that there is a lone wolf attack, so-called, where somebody is radicalised online or  somebody has read propaganda - they're not talking to people, they're not using devices -  and so it makes it very hard to detect that individual; and in that circumstance it is very hard  to stop an attack from taking place which is why the police obviously make a regular call for  family members or people that might know an individual in a workplace setting, or at a  community group, or that they see suspicious behaviour otherwise; that they inform the  authorities straight away because generally that is the piece of luck or the bit of information  that completes the jigsaw puzzle.

PETER STEFANOVIC:

You've ordered an inquiry into extremist movements and radicalism in Australia. What do  you hope comes out of that? What needs to change? And do you believe that we have an  issue with white supremacism in Australia now?

PETER DUTTON:



We certainly have an issue with extremists; whether they're on the extreme right wing or  they’re Islamic extremists, that's a concern for us and everybody in between essentially.

I hope to get two things out of this inquiry. I mean one is that I think it's always good to have  a refresh, to look at the laws that we've got, to look at the ways in which our operations are  working, to make sure that we've got the most effective tools to defeat the scourge of  terrorism; but secondly, I also think it's important for people to be properly informed.

I think for example Senator Keneally and some others within the Labor Party probably are  speaking from a base of ignorance at the moment in relation to what's actually happening  by way of effort against these extremists. So I think that educative process is important and  that Senator Keneally and others can learn more about what ASIO is doing because they are  working day and night.

They don't discriminate against somebody because of their ideology, they focus on  somebody because they're a threat, because they have been online advocating a particular  violent outcome, because they're planning an attack, because they're seeking funding for  terrorist activities; whatever it might be, they concentrate on that target because of a threat  that they pose to the Australian public.

So I hope that there's more information that's able to be provided through that committee  report, but also I think it's important for us all the time to say if there's a better way that we  can do things then we're very open to it.

PETER STEFANOVIC:

What information do you have Minister on the threat of an attack? Because at the end of  the day, there have been very few extremist attacks that have taken place in Australia.

PETER DUTTON:



I think Pete to the great credit of the police and to the intelligence agencies, there's  obviously an enormous amount of work that Australians just don't see that goes on behind  the scenes every day. We have analysts, we have incredible arrangements with our Five  Eyes partners - so we're pulling in intelligence from all over the world - to look at these  individuals, to look at the groups, to look at the way in which people are being influenced  online.

One of the biggest problems we've got, as the ASIO Director-General has pointed out, is that  nine out of 10 of these terrorists now, or terrorist organisations, are dealing through  encryption - so they're anonymised apps. Now, encryption is good if we're using it for  internet banking and protecting ourselves from criminals, but where criminals are using  encryption to protect themselves from detection or from efforts by the police, then that is  obviously a bad thing.

When you've got Facebook and others, who have these end-to-end encrypted apps, it  means that the terrorists, that the child sex offenders can speak to each other in an  anonymised way, they can trade secrets and planning tips etc and we can't see that, that's  the reality. The technology is very hard to deal with, but that's the environment in which the  police and the intel agencies have to operate.

So obviously during COVID we've seen a spike as well. People are spending more time online  and it's very easy for ISIL or for some neo-Nazi lunatic out of the United States to be  communicating with a 15-year-old Australian, sitting behind his computer here at home.

We're up against it and the threat level has been a Probable for a number of years now and  we've just got to make sure that Australians understand that we are a target 24/7 and the  agencies are working around the clock to keep us safe.

PETER STEFANOVIC:

Okay. Minister, just a couple of quick ones before you go. On the cashless debit card last  night, a win of sorts for the Government, the fact that this trial's going to be extended for  another couple of years. Will the Government now give up on its plan to make the cashless  debit card permanent?

PETER DUTTON:



Well Pete, I actually think this is a win for communities and for families. I think that it's very  important to understand that if you're in an environment where, you know, mum or dad has  a drug habit and money is being spent to fuel that habit instead of being spent on food for  kids and their education needs, then I think that's a tragedy. The idea of the card is to help  those families deal with the priorities and the priorities are to take care of the children, to  take care of their own health needs etc and I think for that reason, it's a very good outcome.

PETER STEFANOVIC:

Okay. But would you like to see it become more permanent? Because as it stands at the  moment, it's just going to be an extension of the trial for two years?

PETER DUTTON:



I think the Government's been very clear about the fact that we see great benefits in it.  Obviously we need to compromise in the Senate to get legislation through because we don't  hold the numbers and the Labor Party for some reason is opposed to a card which helps  families deal with addiction, or prioritise spending on their children, over alcohol  consumption or whatever it might be. It provides, I think, a much better outcome and in the  end this money is being provided by taxpayers who are working hard to provide support to  those most in need, not to provide, you know, support to an addiction or money being  diverted to a gambling habit, whatever it might be.

PETER STEFANOVIC:

Okay. There's some allegations…well Labor says there's racist elements to this. What's your  view of that?

PETER DUTTON:



I just think it's absurd and I think it's an attempt, frankly, a pretty cheap attempt to mask  their opposition to this. Now they can explain, Anthony Albanese can explain the reason for  that. I mean he's in all sorts of strife at the moment, as you know; I think he's barely keeping  Labor together. So they will throw out these red herrings and try and distract away from the  reality of the dysfunction within the Labor Party at the moment.

There is no justification not to support what is a sensible policy and ultimately, as I say, it's  designed to help taxpayers' money, people who work hard for their money and are happy to

see some of that money go to support Australians who are in a tougher position, but not to  see that money diverted to pubs or to gambling or to drug dealers etc.

I think it's with merit. The evidence is there that it works. It works in Indigenous  communities as well as in communities in capital cities and we've been very honest about  that.

PETER STEFANOVIC:

Just finally Minister, there is a Cabinet reshuffle that's coming. There's a bit of talk around  that you may be heading to Defence. What do you think about that?

PETER DUTTON:



Well Pete, I don't think that's likely. I think I'm likely to stay in Home Affairs and that  ultimately is a decision for the Prime Minister. I've been around longer than you, obviously  much older than you, but I've watched these shows before and anyone who has a crystal  ball that can pick what happens in reshuffles is better than me.

There's always speculation. In the end, there's one person who knows what the outcome  will be and obviously we've got a great depth of talent in the Liberal Party and the National  Party and it's always a tough decision.

I think John Howard used to say that this is the toughest of decisions as a leader because we  bat pretty deep. We've got a lot of good people on the backbench that could be on the  frontbench, but equally, we've got a lot of talent on the frontbench, including the Defence  Minister.

PETER STEFANOVIC:

Okay. Well if the Prime Minister says to you; righto, we're moving some parts around here,  change is as good as a holiday. Mr Dutton, I want you to do the Defence, would you take it?

PETER DUTTON:



Pete, if he says to me: do you want to do Defence? Do you want to sit on the backbench?  You know, do you want to go to the beach early this year…?

PETER STEFANOVIC:

You wouldn't go to the backbench, come on.

PETER DUTTON:



He's the boss, right? So, you do as he says. I mean similar to what you do at home and what  you do, I don't know, when the editor calls up and tells you to wind up these interviews  when I'm talking for too long…

PETER STEFANOVIC:

I've got to go and babysit. It's not very appealing at all, let me tell you.

PETER DUTTON:



Do as you're told brother, that's my advice.

PETER STEFANOVIC:

That's right. Peter Dutton appreciate your time. Thanks for joining us here. We'll talk to you  soon.

PETER DUTTON:



Thanks mate. Take care.
