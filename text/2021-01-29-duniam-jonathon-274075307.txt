EPBC milestone in improved environmental laws to support economic recovery minister.awe.gov.au/duniam/media-releases/epbc-milestone-improved-environmental-laws-support-economic-recovery

29 January 2021

Assistant Minister for Forestry and Fisheries Jonno Duniam has welcomed the release of the independent statutory review of the EPBC Act by Professor Graeme Samuel AC.



“The release of the final EPBC Act review marks another milestone in the Morrison Government’s significant reform of Australia’s environmental law, to support jobs,” Assistant Minister Duniam said.



“Already we have before the Senate legislation to implement national Cabinet’s decision to move to a single touch model for environmental approvals.



“There will be more reforms to come, as we work through the full detail of the recommendations with stakeholders and create frameworks for change.



“Our Government is committed to reforms that both maintain environmental protections, and support our economic recovery as we emerge from the COVID-19 crisis.



“It is clear that the current approval system creates burdensome duplication and inefficiencies where the Commonwealth and state environment laws interact.

“Our reforms will ensure the EPBC Act is fit for purpose for Australians and Tasmanians, remove uncertainty and duplication, and give business greater certainty.

“I look forward to working with the Tasmanian Government on these reforms to protect the environment, jobs and our economic future.”
