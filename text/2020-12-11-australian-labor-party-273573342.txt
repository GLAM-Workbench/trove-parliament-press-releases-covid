RICHARD MARLES MP

DEPUTY LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY  SHADOW MINISTER FOR DEFENCE  MEMBER FOR CORIO



E&OE TRANSCRIPT  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA  FRIDAY, 11 DECEMBER 2020

SUBJECTS: UQ vaccine trial cancelled; National Cabinet; Vaccination.

JOURNALIST: Obviously a bit of a blow to Australian vaccine hopes with one of  the four being struck out. Your general reaction to the news breaking this  morning?

RICHARD MARLES, DEPUTY LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR  PARTY: It is a blow. What's really important now is that the Government gives a  very clear explanation of what's happened, or what the plan is going forward.  Because vaccines are going to be a critical part of getting us past the COVID-19  crisis. And it's really important that the government maintains public confidence  around this program.

JOURNALIST: National Cabinet meeting today, first face-to-face meeting since  forming. There have been some serious disagreements between the leaders,  how do you think they're going to go today?

MARLES: Well, it's nice that National Cabinet is meeting in person. It's another  sign that we're getting back to some sense of normality. I mean, I think the  Government has seen Australia- the Australian Federation put under as much  stress as it ever has been this year, that's been a function of a lack of leadership  on the part of the Prime Minister. So, what I hope to see from National Cabinet  today is much more leadership from the Prime Minister about how the country  can move forward as one.

JOURNALIST: The vaccine though is on the agenda today as one of the  priorities. In terms of the false positive HIV test, obviously, not HIV but we have  already seen quite a lot of movement on social media, even before today about



the anti-vaxxer movement. No doubt this will be ceased upon. Is there a role  here for government for an information message, a public information campaign  to try and really allay some of those concerns? Because no doubt today's news  possibly could give that movement, a bit of ammunition?

MARLES: Absolutely. It is really important that the Government gives a very  clear explanation of the decisions that it has made, the plan that it has going  forward, so that it can maintain public confidence in the program of working on  and ultimately allowing a vaccine for the Australian community because that's  going to be very important. Vaccines matter. They deeply matter. This is  obviously a big blow. But the role for Government today, is to make sure that  they are inspiring confidence in the Australian people about the program of  developing and ultimately rolling out a vaccine in this country.

JOURNALIST: Are you going to get the jab when it becomes valuable?

MARLES: Oh, absolutely. I'll be taking all the medical advice. And I have  confidence in our doctors, in our scientists to make sure that when the vaccine  is publicly available, that'll be safe and I'll definitely be taking the vaccine.
