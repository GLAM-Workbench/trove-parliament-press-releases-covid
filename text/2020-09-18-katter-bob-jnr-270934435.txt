Subsidised Q Fever vaccine a must after another NQ outbreak   KENNEDY MP, Bob Katter is calling on the Federal Health Minister to subsidise the vaccine for the  debilitating Q Fever infection, following another outbreak in North Queensland that is impacting livestock  industry workers.

Q Fever is a bacterial infection caused by the bacteria Coxiella burnetii. The bacteria are most commonly  found in cattle, sheep, and goats around the world, and humans typically get Q Fever when they breathe in  dust that has been contaminated by infected animals.

Mr Katter said the latest outbreak in North Queensland should be taken seriously and that the Federal  Government must act.

“At a time when we have a shortage of farm workers due to Covid-19 related border closures, we can’t  have all our ringers, graziers and cattlemen going down with Q Fever,” Mr Katter said.

“Q Fever rears its ugly head with regularity in regional parts of Australia like the Kennedy electorate, so it is  quite extraordinary that it is not on the Medicare ‘freebie’ list.

“If a person gets Q Fever then you’ve got a huge health crisis for the Australian public. The Commonwealth  Serum Laboratories of course were privatised so now it costs money to subsidise or make the vaccine free.”

Currently the Q Fever vaccine costs around $150, and in some cases up to $400.[1]

Mr Katter acknowledged that the Federal Government had committed $1.87m to support the development  of a new, cheaper Q Fever vaccine[2], but Mr Katter said regional Queenslanders couldn’t wait and the  current vaccine must immediately be subsidised.

The Katter’s Australian Party founder said a public health campaign relating to the dangers of Q Fever  should also be initiated in the beef and agricultural industries.

“A good friend of mine from Hughenden recently went down with Q Fever, but he didn’t know about the  vaccine despite working in the cattle industry all his life,” he said.

“Q Fever is one of the most debilitating diseases that agricultural workers face and contamination can lead  to lengthy periods of sickness. The symptoms are so hard to identify that unless you are familiar with the  region you’d probably diagnose it as flu.”
