AUSTRALIAN DATA AND DIGITAL COUNCIL COMMUNIQUÃÂ

31 JULY 2020

Australian Data and Digital Council Ministers met today (by teleconference), continuing their  monthly meeting cycle, to discuss data and digital transformation and shared challenges arising  from the coronavirus pandemic.

The following Ministers attended the meeting:

Ã¯ÂÂ· The Hon Stuart Robert MP (Commonwealth)  Ã¯ÂÂ· The Hon Victor Dominello MP (New South Wales)   Ã¯ÂÂ· The Hon Danny Pearson MP (Victoria)  Ã¯ÂÂ· The Hon Dave Kelly MLA (Western Australia)  Ã¯ÂÂ· The Hon Michael Ferguson MP (Tasmania)

Access to accurate information to better support coronavirus recovery efforts

Jurisdictions continue to work to unlock important data to assist in Australia’s recovery from the  dual health and economic crises we are facing. Establishing an evidence-based understanding of  emerging issues across jurisdictions will enable all governments to better work together to improve  Australia’s recovery and response. This will be particularly important to support the National  Cabinet’s job making agenda.

Collaboration on digital identity activities

Ministers continue to work towards a consistent approach for digital identity across Australia.  Ministers agreed to the development of a National Digital Identity Roadmap as part of the ADDC’s  commitment to pursue alignment to the Trusted Digital Identity Framework. Taking a national  approach will:

Ã¯ÂÂ· ensure consistency and interoperability across jurisdictions on digital identity verification  Ã¯ÂÂ· support the ability for commonly held digital identities to be re-used across jurisdictions, and  Ã¯ÂÂ· provide better, more convenient experiences for people and businesses interacting with  government and across government boundaries.

Digital inclusion for all Australians

Ensuring no one is left behind by the digital divide continues to be an area of focus, with Ministers  agreeing that while emerging digital technologies and services present significant opportunity to  improve the lives of all Australians, many are missing out on the everyday opportunities that  technology provides.
