SHADOW MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCES  MEMBER FOR HUNTER



E&OE TRANSCRIPT  RADIO INTERVIEW  2GB - ‘QUESTION TIME’ WITH DEB KNIGHT  FRIDAY, 27 MARCH 2020

SUBJECT: Coronavirus.

DEB KNIGHT, HOST: I just spoke to Kate Carnell and she wants a pause on  payments for things like energy bills to ensure businesses - small businesses  and individual households - can stay on their feet and keep their heads above  water. That’s your portfolio as Energy Minister Angus, what are you going to do  in that regard? I understand you’ve got an announcement to make?

ANGUS TAYLOR, MINISTER FOR ENERGY:that’s a great question Deb and  just minutes ago the Australian Energy Regulator put out guidelines that have  been agreed with the big energy companies which will allow small businesses,  or businesses that have gone into hibernation, to avoid making payments.  Completely understandable that this is necessary. Small businesses that are  getting  now revenues, they’ve stopped the business - we’ve seen that with lots  of restaurants, some cafÃÂ©s and beauticians and so-on . they need to be able to  get relief on their electricity and energy bills and that’s what this will allow.  We’ve also in this announcement got an extension - a full extension - of  hardship provisions which are currently available for households, also for small  businesses, that will mean no disconnections, no late fees or interest charges  and no debt collection for any business that is in hardship. They are very, very  important changes, they’ve been agreed with the big energy companies, this I  not an easy time for small business, that’s for sure, and I’m seeing it in my own  electorate, but this provides at least some relief - there’s much more work to do  with other utilities and council rates and so-on - and rent - but this is a very,  very important step forward.

KNIGHT: there you go, you heard it here first. The energy Regulator’s  announcing changes to waiving of disconnection and reconnection fees for  small businesses and offering households and businesses some help too if  they’re facing financial stress. That announcement just made by Angus Taylor,

the Energy Minister. Obviously very welcome, Joel, but we’re seeing that there  is this real disconnect between our politicians at the moment. You’re meant to  be working together and we’ve got Albo out, earlier in the week, this is him on  the attack, actually, we’ve got the audio of him speaking:

Anthony Albanese recording: I watched the Prime Minister’s statement,  which of course went for more than half an hour. It was confusing, it was the  reading-out of a list…

KNIGHT: Why are we trying to point-score here at the moment, Joel?

JOEL FITZGIBBON, SHADOW MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND  RESOURCES: well Deb, like all of your listeners, I’m sure, we are growing  more and more frustrated and more and more tired of this sort of piecemeal  approach. We gave or provided absolute bipartisanship for around seven  weeks. We offered constructive criticism, along the way of course, but the  Government could not have complained over those early couple of months  about the way in which we stuck to that bipartisan approach. But like your  listeners we’re basically sick of it. We’re inundated, Members of Parliament, all  day, every day with people who are victims of this chaotic and dysfunctional  approach we’ve seen from the Government. You’ve seen mistakes, you’ve  seen the confusion and you know just today, he was just behind Boris Johnson  and Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand, but you can see how they’re avoiding this  sort of plethora of initiatives we’re seeing from the Government - some well-targeted, some not so well-targeted - but just providing people with a  restoration of their income…

KNIGHT: But this is the official advice that they’re taking and Angus, no doubt,  you want to respond to this. This is coming from - Government is taking advice  from the health authorities here?

FITZGIBBON: well Deb I defended Scott Morrison in every interview I’ve done  up until now and including on this segment last week. But it’s very, very clear  that there is a whole range of competing advice. I don’t know what’s happening  in the National Cabinet but I’d be very, very surprised if that advice is not  contested in that forum and we need a Prime Minister who not only shows  leadership but makes the best call off the back of that competing advice and I  think it’s clear to all of your listeners that he’s not making the right decisions,  that we have this plethora of decisions that are only causing more chaos and  confusion. Look Deb, we wouldn’t have thousands of people lining up at  Centrelink if we were taking the approach adopted in the US, the UK and in  New Zealand. Rather than send people to all of these different avenues of  assistance, some effective, some ineffective, why don’t we just restore people’s  wages like they are doing elsewhere?

KNIGHT: Angus… let’s let Angus respond to that.

TAYLOR: well look our focus is on saving lives and saving livelihoods. I mean,  we’re got to do both and it’s really important to highlight the twin nature of this  crisis. It’s a health crisis and it’s an economic crisis. And we’re focusing on  both. We’ve heard others suggest that we shouldn’t focus on both - well we  are. There’s a lot of decisions to make - we’re making them and we’re  absolutely getting on with it.  And look, to Joel’s point: small businesses are  getting support to keep employees on. Up to $100,000 available through  PAYG, for employees. There is very strong focus on employee retention, here,  but most importantly, we’ve to solve both the health crisis and retain our  business capability in our country and we are doing both, unashamedly. It’s  incredibly important we do both. It would be good if this was bipartisan but  we’re going to lead, we’ve got a plan, we’re building capacity in the health  system and retaining capacity in the economy and we’ll continue to do both  every day.

KNIGHT: now what about the issue of politicians’ pay because we’ve seen  Craig Kelly, Liberal, coming out saying all politicians and top bureaucrats  should take a 20 per cent pay cut. Is that something you’re prepared to take?  Angus?

TAYLOR: ah look, we talked about this last week…

KNIGHT: we did and you didn’t give me an answer. So can you give me an  answer now?

TAYLOR: we both agreed. We both agreed that we would do whatever  necessary…

KNIGHT: so will you take a 20 per cent pay cut…?

TAYLOR: … just to finish that point, though Deb. We’re putting to the  Remuneration Tribunal a request for pay freeze on all positions - that’s both  politicians and senior bureaucrats - that’s absolutely appropriate. But as Joel  said last week, and I’m sure he still takes this view, I’ll do whatever is  necessary…

KNIGHT: … is that a yes?

TAYLOR: I’ll do whatever is necessary. Of course, you know. We will do what  is right to ensure we get through this.

KNIGHT: all right, I’ll take that as a yes, then. Joel, from you?

FITZGIBBON: look Deb I just don’t care. I’m on the phone all day and all night  to desperate people who in part are suffering from the poorly-targeted  assistance coming from this Government and frankly it has me distressed, I am  sad, so it’s just a non-issue for me and I challenge Angus: we didn’t say it’s not  both a health and an economic issue. What Anthony Albanese said is that if  you get the health side of the equation right, that is if you act meaningfully and  quickly enough, the economy in part takes care of itself. So we have to get the  health thing right first and of course we need to provide people in the  community and the economy with the support it needs, and small business  people everywhere I’m afraid were laughing at Angus when he said we are  doing plenty for them, because half of my day is spent talking to small business  people and they just don’t feel that is the case and they tell me, by the way  Deb, that the biggest issue for them is rent. You can’t pay if you don’t have any  business income, just like families can’t pay their rent on their households,  without a job and this has to be a big focus for us Deb. We can’t expect people  to isolate if they don’t have a home to isolate in.

KNIGHT: and we will bring you that information when it is released from the  Prime Minister, as soon as it happens. We know the meeting is taking place at  the moment with the National Cabinet. They’re considering that issue of rent so  we’ll bring that to you as it happens. Now look I know Joel you …

FITZGIBBON: eight weeks on, Deb. Eight weeks on!

TAYLOR: Joel, look. Let’s be clear. I mean we’re working through all of those  issues that businesses that have gone into hibernation - or near hibernation -  are dealing with. One of them we’ve announced today on energy. These are  important initiatives, we’re working at a rate that governments never normally  work at and the announcement today about allowing businesses to go into  hibernation without paying energy costs, hardship policies extended to small  businesses, you know how important energy is for small businesses, Joel.  Everyone does.

KNIGHT:… yeah that is a welcome announcement…

FITZGIBBON: … you’re not acting at a rate that we acted in during the Global  Financial Crisis.

KNIGHT: now fellas I want to end this on a nice note. We’re going to talk about  pets in a minute because so many people - we’re seeing everyone doing their  interviews from home and you see dogs curled up in the corner, and the cats  are bringing joy. I’ve got chooks at my place, last weekend and the kids  absolutely loving it. It’s a great distraction. But what’s happening at your place  to give you a little bit of relief? Because we all need to try and turn our minds off  at some point in the day. Joel, what are you doing to try and find some light to



all the darkness we’re seeing?

FITZGIBBON: well I hope this doesn’t get me into trouble Deb. But a nice glass  of Hunter wine country wine and a good dose of Netflix. I just need to stop  looking at my phone while I’m watching the Netflix shows because I find myself  regularly rewinding because I just realise I missed the last 30 seconds.

KNIGHT: glass of wine? You won’t in trouble with anyone for that. What about  you Angus?

TAYLOR: well I’m getting more time with the family. I’ve got two kids home  from university and kids at school who are at home during the day - just in the  last day or so - and that’s  lovely. I even got out for a short horse ride with my  daughter a couple of days ago which was fantastic - I had three phone calls  during the ride but talking of pets it was good to reconnect with our horses.

KNIGHT: absolutely. It’s good to see the silver lining and to grasp it when we  can. Gentleman always good to talk we’ll chat again next Friday. Thanks so  much.
