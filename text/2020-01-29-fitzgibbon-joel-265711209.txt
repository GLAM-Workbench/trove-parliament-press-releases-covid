THE HON JOEL FITZGIBBON MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCES  MEMBER FOR HUNTER



MORRISON GOVERNMENT MUST CONTAIN CORONAVIRUS AT OUR  PORTS

Agriculture Minister Bridget McKenzie must come out of hiding and ensure Australia’s ports  are properly monitored for Coronavirus, says Shadow Agriculture Minister Joel  Fitzgibbon.

“Minister McKenzie failed to implement the Biosecurity Imports Levy despite promising to  have it in place at our ports by July last year,” said Mr Fitzgibbon. “The Government has to  take biosecurity seriously and that means an effective protocol at our ports now that we’re  threatened by the deadly Coronavirus.”

He echoed the concerns of the Maritime Union of Australia which today claimed the  Government had left a “gaping hole” in the biosecurity net, with potentially inadequate  monitoring of foreign vessels arriving in Australian ports.

“The MUA’s members are boarding these ships with no independent verification of who is  on-board and whether they are carrying Coronavirus,” said Mr Fitzgibbon. “We learn from  the union that ship captains can self-declare the medical status of their seafarers, in an  email.”

The MUA revealed that Australian maritime workers usually board foreign ships before  biosecurity officers, and most foreign merchant ships did not have a doctor on-board.

Mr Fitzgibbon said the Government’s inability to implement a Biosecurity Imports Levy was  of concern to Australians.

“The role of Government is to keep us safe from foreign threats. The delayed Biosecurity  system has created concern for the agriculture sector but now with Coronavirus, the threat  is to the entire population.

“The Minister for Agriculture has to come out of hiding, get back to work and let all  Australians know that there’s an effective biosecurity system in place.”
