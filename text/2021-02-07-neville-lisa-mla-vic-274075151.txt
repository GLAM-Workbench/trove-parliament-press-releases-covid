Projects to build local economic recovery and resilience in  bushfire-affected areas

Astro tourism, hot springs and revamped streetscapes are among the 20 new projects to  share in $32.9 million in support for regional economic recovery across bushfire-affected  areas of Victoria.

Announcing further Local Economic Recovery grants today, Australian Minister for  Emergency Management David Littleproud, Victorian Minister for Police and Emergency  Services Lisa Neville, and Victorian Minister for Regional Development Mary-Anne  Thomas congratulated applicants on their project ideas that will help stimulate economic  growth and build economic resilience.

“These projects will bring employment and economic benefits to these communities that  have been so hard hit by the 2019-20 bushfires, and now COVID-19.

“Regionally-driven economic projects will create jobs, attract visitors and help our regional  Victorian towns thrive into the future - a great step forward in bushfire recovery,” said  Minister Littleproud

Twenty projects were announced today under the Victorian Government’s Regional  economic stimulus and resilience grants - under the Australian and Victorian governments’  $68.6 million Local Economic Recovery (LER) program.

“The Local Economic Recovery Program is funding these major economic stimulus  projects to secure the future of our regional towns and projects by injecting funding at a  local level, exactly where it is needed.

“Recovery is a long journey. We’re here to listen to and support local communities along  the way, they are the ones who know what works best for them.

“Further rounds of Local Economic Recovery funding for local community projects will be  available this year, ensuring communities have the time they need to determine their local  priorities and get their ideas right,” said Minister Neville

“These projects achieve a lot - from creating more opportunities for young indigenous  people to helping local governments entice tourists back to their regions.

“This funding will increase long-term resilience and give local business a strong foundation  on which to build back even stronger,” said Minister Thomas.

The Victorian LER programs regional economic stream is now fully allocated, but there are  still opportunities to apply under the local community projects grants stream.

Applications for two further rounds of LER local community project grants will open in  March (Round 2) and July (Round 3) 2021. More information, as well as an Expression of  Interest form, is available at: www.vic.gov.au/local-economic-recovery-program-bushfire-affected-communities.
