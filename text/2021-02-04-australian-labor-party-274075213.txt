RISING CONCERNS ABOUT RACISM REQUIRES ACTION



The latest Mapping Social Cohesion report by the Scanlon Foundation shows a rising concern

about racism in the Australian community.



37 percent of Australian-born respondents and 59 percent of Asian-born respondents

expressed concern that racism was a growing problem in Australia. Disturbingly, 22 per cent of

Chinese Australian respondents reported they had experienced discrimination more often

since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.



Rising concerns about racism, requires action and consistent leadership.



Labor continues to call on the Morrison Government to tackle racism by committing to a

national anti-racism strategy.



This year the Scanlon report undertook two surveys - carried out in July and November 2021 -

consisting of more than 140 questions on community attitudes and social cohesion.



Starting in 2007, the Mapping Social Cohesion reports provide a series of valuable longitudinal

surveys on attitudes to social cohesion, immigration and population issues.



The report also found that 49 per cent of people surveyed said they held 'very negative' or



'somewhat negative' feelings towards people of Iraqi and Sudanese backgrounds in Australia,

while 47 per cent had negative feelings towards Chinese Australians.



Also of considerable concern is evidence of discrimination toward faith groups, particularly

towards the Muslim community, 37 percent of people said they have negative or very negative

view of Muslims. This must be addressed as a matter of urgency.



Encouragingly, 84 per cent of respondents agreed multiculturalism has been good for Australia

- up from 80 per cent the year before.



Labor believes that multiculturalism is one of Australia’s greatest achievements. However, this

report demonstrates that we can’t take our success for granted.



We need leadership that brings Australians together, not divides us.
