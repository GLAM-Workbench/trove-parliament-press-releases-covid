Agriculture saleyards and auctions can continue



The Minister for Agriculture and Emergency Management, David Littleproud confirmed  today that livestock saleyards and wool auctions are able to continue.

“These are an essential part of the broader agriculture supply chain,” Minister Littleproud  said.

“They are different to real estate auctions because of their importance to the nation.

“The Government is working tirelessly to safeguard the supply chain from the farm to the  market.

“In particular, interruptions to livestock saleyards could impact adversely on the availability  and price of meat.

“Like the rest of Australia, livestock saleyards and wool auctions will need to comply with  strict social distancing and hygiene practices.

“This includes no more than one person per four square metres at indoor auctions and any  other particular requirements of your jurisdiction.

“Wash your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, avoid  touching your face and if sick, stay home.

“I thank the National Auction Selling Committee and the individual saleyards that have  already taken steps to implement social distancing protocols.

“And I ask those involved to please consider if their livestock saleyards and wool auctions  can be held online, remotely, deferred or be cancelled to do so.

“Agriculture and food security are critical to Australia at the best of times. They are even  more so during this the COVID-19 crisis.”
