NEW IMAGES OF WESTERN SYDNEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

New images of the Morrison Government’s $5.3 billion Western Sydney International  terminal concept design have today been released showcasing what travelers could expect  to see in 2026.

The terminal precinct will include a public plaza, retail and dining options and will be  connected to the new M12 Motorway and Sydney Metro - Western Sydney Airport train  service.

Progress on building the Western Sydney International (Nancy-Bird Walton) Airport is  forging ahead with the shortlisting of three parties to tender for construction of the airport  terminal.

Lendlease CPB Joint Venture (a joint venture between Lendlease Building and CPB  Contractors), Multiplex Constructions and Watpac Construction have been chosen by the  Western Sydney Airport (WSA Co) to tender for construction of the terminal.

Design of Western Sydney International’s passenger terminal is ongoing and will be  finalised when the winning contractor is appointed in mid-2021. Terminal construction is due  to begin by the end of 2021.

Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said this announcement will give Western Sydney  residents confidence that the Government continues to roll out this major investment into  the future.

“The Government is committed to delivering this once-in-a-generation infrastructure project,  ensuring employment opportunities in the region now and for the long term,” Minister  Cormann said.

Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure Alan Tudge said continued work on  the Western Sydney Airport site throughout COVID-19 was an important element of  Australia’s economic response.

“Built by local workers, the airport will support 11,000 direct and indirect jobs in the Western  Sydney region during construction delivering massive economic benefits to the region,” Mr  Tudge said.

Liberal Senator for Western Sydney, Senator the Hon Marise Payne, said Sydney remains  Australia’s premier international gateway.

“As a springboard for our economy, the Western Sydney International Airport will help meet  growing demand for jobs and infrastructure in the decades ahead,” Senator Payne said.

Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said Western Sydney is on its  way to being a global city in its own right.

“With the Morrison Government’s continued strong investment across the region, Western  Sydney is being truly transformed,” Mr Taylor said.

Federal Member for Lindsay, Melissa McIntosh MP said in Western Sydney, we’re  delivering congestion busting infrastructure and more importantly - we’re creating jobs to  keep communities connected and keep local businesses in business.”

“We’re creating 200,000 jobs by supercharging the Aerotropolis and agribusiness precinct  and building the skills in our local community through new education opportunities to ensure  the jobs of the future in Western Sydney stay local. Over 28,000 full time jobs will be  created within five years of the opening of the Airport,” Ms McIntosh said.

“In Lindsay, we’re looking to the jobs of the future in emerging industries in space, defence,  advanced manufacturing, STEM, research, start-ups and more. These industries will play  an important role in Australia’s roadmap beyond Coronavirus, creating jobs and supporting  local families.”

Early works on the terminal are expected to begin in 2021. The airport remains on track to  commence operations in 2026.
