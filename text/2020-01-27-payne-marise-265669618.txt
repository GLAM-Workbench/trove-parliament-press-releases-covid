MEDIA RELEASE

AUSTRALIANS IN HUBEI PROVINCE, CHINA

The Government acknowledges the concerns of Australians who are in Hubei Province in China  and the concerns of their families and friends.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working closely with Chinese authorities and  international partners to consider possible assistance with travel for Australians from areas that  are affected by Chinese travel restrictions.

Given the circumstances of the spread of the Coronavirus, Chinese authorities are currently  imposing very tight restrictions on all travel from Hubei. We are seeking advice from the  Chinese authorities on these restrictions and whether any options are available to international  travellers.

Our Embassy in Beijing and our Consulate in Shanghai are also working with international  partners and the Chinese government to determine what support can be given to Australians on  the ground. Australia does not have a consular presence in Wuhan.

Australians who believe they have family in the affected area should contact DFATâ€™s consular  emergency line on 1300 555 135 in Australia or +61 2 6261 3305 from overseas.  We also  recommend travellers subscribe for Smartraveller updates at www.smartraveller.gov.au.
