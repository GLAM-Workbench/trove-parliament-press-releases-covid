CHRIS BOWEN MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR HEALTH  MEMBER FOR MCMAHON



PREPARATION FOR PANDEMIC CRITICAL AS SECTOR IDENTIFIES  NEEDS

Labor welcomes the outcomes on Coronavirus from the COAG Health Council meeting  today, just as we have provided bipartisan support for the actions taken to this point.

Labor appreciates the regular briefings the Chief Medical Officer has provided on the  disease and the steps put in place.

It is important that the next steps for pandemic preparation are agreed across jurisdictions.

It is also important that preparations incorporate the needs of primary care providers who  will have a critical role in the event of a Coronavirus outbreak in Australia, including close  consultation with the AMA and RACGP.

Yesterday the Morrison Government announced the activation of the Australian Health  Sector Emergency Response Plan For Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).

The plan was actually published on February 18, and has provided the basis for action  since then. Yesterday’s formal activation was simply the next, logical step in the process.

It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister chose to announce the formal activation of the plan  in Parliament without the usual courtesies to the Opposition.

It is also unfortunate the Minister for Health chose to mischaracterise Wednesday  evening’s briefing to the Opposition.

Despite the unfortunate breach of bipartisanship by the Government, Labor will continue to  act and engage constructively on this public health challenge.
