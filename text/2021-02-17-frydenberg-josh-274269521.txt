MEDIA RELEASE

17 February 2021  EXTENSION OF MEASURES RELATING TO VIRTUAL AGMs  AND SIGNING AND SENDING ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS

As part of our economic plan, the Morrison Government will introduce legislation into Parliament to  extend the application of temporary relief measures introduced at the height of the coronavirus crisis  relating to virtual AGMs and signing and sending electronic documents.

Specifically, the Treasuy Laws Amendment (2021 Measures No. 1) Bill will extend from 21 March 2021 to  15 September 2021 the expiry date of the temporary relief allowing companies to use technology to  meet regulatory requirements to hold meetings, such as annual general meetings, distribute meeting-related materials and validly execute documents.

Following 15 September 2021, member meetings will need to be conducted consistent with pre-COVID-19 laws which require an-in person meeting to be held.

The Government will also conduct a 12 month opt-in pilot for companies to hold hybrid annual  general meetings to enable a proper assessment of the shareholder benefits of virtual meetings.

The Government will finalise permanent changes to allow electronically signing and sending documents  prior to the expiry of these temporary arrangements on 15 September.

Extension of this temporary relief will allow businesses to continue to comply with their regulatory  requirements as they continue to deal with and emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.
