Greens call on Labor and Crossbench to oppose unfair, wasteful tax cuts

Greens Leader Adam Bandt says Labor and the crossbench must join the Greens in opposing tax cuts to the super-wealthy, warning that Scott Morrison’s COVID recovery budget looked set to supercharge inequality and create a ‘lost generation’ of young people.

Shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers refused to rule out supporting a fast-tracking of Stages 2 & 3 of the government’s $286 billion tax cut package, which overwhelmingly benefits people on higher incomes. Mr Bandt said with economists discrediting the Government spin that Stage 2 was ‘kinder’ than Stage 3, both should be opposed.

“The Government is choosing to create a high unemployment future. We must stand up to this government. Labor can’t roll over and vote with the government again,” Mr Bandt said.

“Blocking this handout for the super-wealthy would be Labor’s first step in fixing the mistake of supporting these tax cuts in the first place.

“Tax cuts mean nothing for the million people out of work in Australia, and will strip away money that could be invested in public housing, high speed rail and free childcare.

“We’re risking a lost generation of young people if the government doesn’t invest in nation-building, planet-saving projects with a jobs guarantee.

“A government that always demonised debt is now borrowing money to give a tax cut to super-wealthy people like Clive Palmer.

“Instead of giving handouts to big corporations and millionaires, we should invest in a Green New Deal to get to full employment, tackle the climate crisis and reduce inequality.”
