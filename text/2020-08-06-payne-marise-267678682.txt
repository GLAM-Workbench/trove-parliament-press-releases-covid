STATEMENT

Australia-New Zealand Foreign Minister Consultations

Today, I joined New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Winston  Peters for our biannual Australia-New Zealand Foreign Minister Consultations, held  virtually on this occasion.

The trans-Tasman relationship is a special one, built on our shared values, close  economic links and mutual strategic interest in a secure, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.

Our cooperation in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the closeness of  the ties between our countries.

During our virtual meeting, we discussed plans to establish a trans-Tasman COVID-Safe Travel Zone, when all required conditions are met and it is safe to do so.

Australia and New Zealand are working closely with our neighbours in the Pacific to  respond to the health and economic challenges of COVID19, and to plan for economic  recovery. Under Australia’s Pacific Step-up and New Zealand’s Pacific Reset, both  countries have demonstrated our enduring commitment to promoting security,  prosperity and stability in the Pacific.

Our consultations today will strengthen our cooperation in response to the global  pandemic.

We will continue to work with New Zealand to promote the rules-based international  order, strengthen our global institutions, and build international cooperation, including a  focus on our important relationships across ASEAN, the East Asia Summit, Five Eyes  and the Pacific Islands Forum.

Working with counterparts is vital to a strong Indo-Pacific.
