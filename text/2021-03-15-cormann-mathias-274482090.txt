O E C D  S E C R E T A R Y - G E N E R A L  S E L E C T I O N

Earlier today I learned that the Selection Committee will recommend to the OECD Council that I be  appointed as next Secretary-General of the OECD.

Throughout the selection process over the last few months, I have engaged positively with all OECD  members and learned about their priorities for one of the most important international organisations in  the world.

It would be a privilege and an honour to take on the leadership of the OECD. It brings together like- minded countries from around the world committed to developing and delivering better policies for  better lives.

It provides a great platform for international cooperation and best practice policy development, from  the foundation of a shared commitment to democracy, human rights, the rule of law, market-based  economic principles and a rules-based international order.

The issues and the specific policy challenges the world faces evolve over time, but the OECD’s capacity  to find solutions and better ways forward has stood the test of time.

As the world continues to grapple with the impact of the most serious pandemic in more than a  century, our essential mission of the past - to promote stronger, cleaner, fairer economic growth and to  raise employment and living standards - remains the critically important mission for the future.

ÃÂngel GurrÃÂ­a has served the OECD as Secretary-General with great passion, commitment and  dedication for 15 years. He has increased the influence of the Organisation, expanded its membership to  include thriving economies of Central Europe, the Baltic and South America, while also strengthening its  engagement with other multilateral and regional organisations.

I too am ambitious for the OECD. I look forward to working with him and the OECD General Council  through a smooth transition.

It will be important to keep the momentum going, to:

- help maximise the strength of the economic recovery in the wake of COVID-19 through strong,  sustainable, cleaner, more inclusive growth;

- drive and promote global leadership on ambitious and effective action on climate change to  achieve global net-zero emissions by 2050;

- finalise a multilateral approach to digital taxation;

- seize the opportunities and better manage the risks in the digital economy;

- promote market-based policies and a rules-based international order; and to

- strengthen the outreach of the OECD into the Asia-Pacific;

I would like to thank Cecilia MalmstrÃÂ¶m, and all of the candidates who put themselves forward as part of  this process, for their hard work and their commitment to the values and the importance of the OECD.

I would like to thank the Australian Government, in particular the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the  Foreign Minister and our two Trade Ministers during this period, for their strong support of my  candidacy.

A particular thank you to the hardworking team at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in  Canberra and around the world, who have done an outstanding job in supporting my campaign.

I would also like to thank the Opposition for their generous offer of bipartisan support.

Out of Western Australia, our Governor Kim Beazley, our Premier Mark McGowan and WA Treasurer  Ben Wyatt provided invaluable support.

I would like to thank the Dean of Ambassadors to the OECD and Chair of the Selection Committee,  Ambassador Christopher Sharrock for his leadership and I would like to thank all Ambassadors for their  engagement with me throughout this selection process.

May I thank OECD member countries again for putting their trust and confidence in me to serve them  as their next Secretary-General over the next five years.

I will give the Organisation and its members my absolute best and strive to make the OECD a place that  inspires collaboration and action in support of a sustainable and inclusive future.
