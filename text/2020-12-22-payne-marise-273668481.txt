APPOINTMENT OF AUSTRALIA-ASEAN COUNCIL  BOARD MEMBERS

I am pleased to announce the appointment of Ms Poh Ling Yeow and Prof. Nicholas Farrelly to  the Board of the Australia-ASEAN Council.

Southeast Asia has profound strategic and economic significance for Australia. The role of the  Australia-ASEAN Council is to support stronger networks between people and institutions in  Australia and the region.

Ms Yeow is a cook, artist, actress, author and television presenter of Malaysian heritage based  in South Australia. Professor Farrelly is Head of Social Sciences at the University of Tasmania.

Ms Yeow and Professor Farrelly will bring new perspectives to the Australia-ASEAN Council  Board and strengthen its focus on supporting friendship, understanding and opportunity  between Australia and Southeast Asia.

I am delighted that intercultural communications consultant Ms Tamerlaine Beasley will continue  to serve on the Board and thank Ms Gabby Costigan for her contribution to the Council.

The Australia-ASEAN Council has also approved 18 community grants that will build on the  governmentâ€™s investment in our partnerships with Southeast Asia and foster engagement during  the COVID-19 pandemic.
