MEETING OF SKILLS MINISTERS - VET SECTOR REFORM IN  RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

Commonwealth, State and Territory Skills Ministers met today to advance priorities to  support Australia’s critical skills and training needs in response to COVID-19 and continue  progressing reforms that will deliver a strong vocational education and training (VET) system  for students, employers and industry.

Ministers confirmed the central role that an accessible, relevant and high-quality training  system will have in Australia’s economic recovery.

Strengthening Australia’s skills and training system is a priority for recovery and now more  than ever we need a responsive and adaptable system that is able to pivot to meet the needs of  learners and the economy.

Through signing of the Heads of Agreement for Skills Reform, seven jurisdictions have  committed to immediate reforms to improve VET quality and relevance along with a set of  high-level reform priorities which will be worked through in detail as part of the negotiation  of a new national skills funding agreement.

The Heads of Agreement, in combination with the JobTrainer Fund, forms a vital part of the  economic recovery. Skills Ministers noted that bilateral discussions on the JobTrainer Fund  have commenced.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash said the JobTrainer Fund is expected to provide for around an additional 340,700  training places for school leavers, and help upskill and retrain jobseekers.

“JobTrainer is a significant joint investment by the Commonwealth and states and territories  in skills and in supporting people into jobs,” Minister Cash said.

“It will not only be central to providing Australians with new opportunities, but it will be  central to our economic recovery.”

The Skills Council also discussed new architecture for Commonwealth-State relations under  National Cabinet and the National Federation Reform Council. The National Cabinet Review

of COAG Councils and Ministerial Forums is currently underway, with recommendations on  the best model for Commonwealth-State relations expected in September 2020.

While the review is underway, Skills Ministers continue to meet to progress critical priorities  and to fulfil regulatory and legislative requirements.

CommuniquÃÂ© for the Skills Ministers’ Meeting

31 July 2020





Skills Ministers met today to advance priorities to support Australia’s critical skills and  training needs in response to COVID-19 and to continue progressing long-term reforms that  will deliver a strong vocational education and training (VET) system for students, employers  and industry.

Skills Ministers confirmed the central role that an accessible, relevant and high quality  training system will have in Australia’s economic recovery.

National Cabinet

Skills Ministers discussed the cessation of COAG and new architecture for Commonwealth-State relations under National Cabinet and the National Federation Reform Council. They  noted that the National Cabinet Review of COAG Councils and Ministerial Forums is  currently underway, with recommendations on the best model for Commonwealth-State  relations expected in September 2020. While the review is underway, Skills Ministers  continue to meet to progress critical priorities and to fulfil regulatory and legislative  requirements.

Skills Reform

Reform of the VET system is central to supporting Australia’s economic recovery and  growth. Skills Ministers acknowledged that the jobs created as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to be the jobs that were lost. Many jobseekers will need to reskill  or upskill, and young people will require support to meet their needs and aspirations.  Strengthening Australia’s skills and training system is a priority for national recovery and  now more than ever we need a responsive and adaptable system that is able to pivot to  meet the needs of learners and the economy.

Through signing of the Heads of Agreement for Skills Reform, seven jurisdictions have  committed to immediate reforms to improve VET quality and relevance along with a set of  high-level reform priorities which will be worked through in detail as part of the negotiation  of a new national skills funding agreement.

The Heads of Agreement, in combination with the JobTrainer Fund, forms a vital part of the  national recovery efforts. Skills Ministers noted that bilateral discussions on the JobTrainer  Fund have commenced. The JobTrainer Fund is expected to provide for around an additional  340,700 training places for school leavers, and help upskill and retrain jobseekers. Places  will be available from September 2020. JobTrainer is a significant joint investment by the  Commonwealth and states and territories in skills for recovery and in supporting people into  jobs.

VET Reform Roadmap

Skills Ministers have worked together over the last twelve months to develop a draft VET  Reform Roadmap (Roadmap). Ministers noted that the Roadmap is the result of significant  collaboration between all jurisdictions and consultation with industry and the VET sector.   This has informed policy priorities in the Heads of Agreement for Skills Reform.

Skills Ministers asked the Skills Senior Officials’ Network to update the draft Roadmap to  reflect the impact of the skills and training system to the COVID-19 pandemic and the  intensive stakeholder feedback.

An updated Roadmap will be considered at the next Skills Ministers’ meeting in the context  of discussions under the Heads of Agreement for Skills Reform.

COVID-19 and skills for recovery

Skills Ministers recognised the significant contribution of the Infection Control Training Fund  to assist Australian workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Skills Ministers noted the  significant work of all jurisdictions in delivering the vital skills needed to limit the spread of  COVID-19. The rapid rollout of the Infection Control Skills Sets has commenced with training  providers offering government funded training to critical workers across the country.

There are training places still available in all states and territories, and this training will  continue to support the re-opening of businesses across Australia.

Apprentices and Traineeships

Ministers considered the progress made by the working group of senior officials to  understand the impacts of COVID-19 on apprenticeships and traineeships. Ministers noted  that whilst there has been an increase in suspensions since the onset of COVID-19, there has  been a decrease in cancellations and withdrawals compared to the same period in 2019.  Analysis by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research attributed this reduction  in cancellations and withdrawals to key government initiatives such as the Supporting  Apprentices and Trainees Wage Subsidy and JobKeeper program.

Members acknowledged the importance of providing support to those apprentices and  trainees most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, in areas such as hairdressing,  automotive, hospitality, tourism. Information from stakeholders suggests that construction  is likely to be significantly impacted over the coming months.

Skills Ministers tasked the Skills Senior Officials’ Network to identify gaps in service delivery  for impacted apprentices and trainees, and to provide advice on how we might increase  new commencements, retention and reengagement of apprentices and trainees for  consideration at the next meeting.





MEM Manufacturing and Engineering Training Package  Ministers discussed next steps for Release 2.0 of the Manufacturing and Engineering Training  Package (MEM R2).



Ministers requested that the Australian Industry and Skills Committee (AISC) urgently  provide up-to-date advice from industry about the workplace practice hours component of  MEM R2, in recognition of changed economic conditions, to enable an endorsement  decision on the MEM R2 during September 2020.



Next meeting

Ministers will meet again in the coming months to progress reforms in the skills and training  sector, and consider the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Australia’s  economic recovery.
