Inquiry report recommends revolutionary funding model for faster rail

A new parliamentary report proposes a fairer and more sustainable approach to faster rail  funding arrangements.

Mr John Alexander OAM MP, Chair of the House of Representatives Infrastructure, Transport  and Cities Committee, tabled the report this week for the committee’s inquiry into options for  financing faster rail.

Value Capture is a funding mechanism by which governments can more fairly pay for part, or  all, of the costs of rail infrastructure projects and provide relief for taxpayers now and in the  future.

Mr Alexander said: “Frankly, to not act on these recommendations would be an egregious  oversight, the evidence is compelling and it is in.

“When government funded infrastructure is clearly linked to significant property value uplifts,  or rezoning, governments have a duty to taxpayers to secure just, equitable and fair portions of  these increases in property values.

“During the inquiry the committee considered the issue of fairness: Is it fair for the taxpayer to  fund infrastructure that creates great wealth for landowners, speculators and developers?  Should the taxpayer receive a return when their money is invested in such a way? Is it fair that  we leave future generations to pay for our spending today?

“Before COVID-19, this committee that I chair saw funding faster rail using Value Capture as an  opportunity. Today, it’s an imperative.”

The report makes three recommendations which focus on Value Capture and Value Sharing,  addressing the missed opportunities where property values rise dramatically as a result of  taxpayer funded rail infrastructure.

The inquiry builds on two previous reports, where the committee John Alexander chairs also  recommended Value Capture model be developed in Australia.
