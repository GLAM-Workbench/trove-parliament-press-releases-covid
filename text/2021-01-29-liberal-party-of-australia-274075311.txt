EO&E......

QUESTION:

Will the Government consider extending support for the aviation sector by six months?

PETER DUTTON:

What the Government's demonstrated very clearly so far is firstly, that we prepared the budget well going into this so we had money in the bank, we had the ability to be able to provide the support that we've provided through JobKeeper, through JobSeeker, through other payments, but the Government's been very clear and we've given plenty of lead time to the fact that JobKeeper will come to an end.

But equally, as the Prime Minister and Treasurer have pointed out, if we take decisions in the future to provide assistance, whether it's to the aviation sector or others that may be impacted by COVID, they're decisions that we would make at the time.

I think Australians understand that the Commonwealth Government firstly made the right decision in closing our borders with the rest of the world, which put us in the best possible position to deal with the threat of COVID and in the response since then, not just in the health space, but in the economic space, has been world class.

We'll make sure that we continue to listen to small businesses, listen to not just employers, but unions and others about how we can continue to provide support to the Australian public.

QUESTION:

What do you think of the Queensland Premier’s call to extend JobKeeper?

PETER DUTTON:

I think the most important thing for the moment for the Queensland Premier to consider is the impact of these snap decisions to close borders. As we've heard from tourism operators, they have bookings and people are arriving that afternoon and on the back of one case, the Premier reacts and closes down the borders.

Now, the better way to deal with that, as we know, is to contain a particular area, to deal with it sensibly, not in a panic way. If we do that, then we have the best chance of preserving jobs because if you're a restaurant owner and you've got bookings for lunch and for dinner, for lunch the next day, you've bought in thousands of dollars' worth of food, you employed staff, you've got a lease to pay, you've got fit out that you've just done in a restaurant, you've got cold rooms to pay the lease for; you can't afford to have no income.

When these snap decisions are made in a panicked way, then you do see job losses and that's not what we want to see. We want to see Australians employed. We want to see businesses stay open so that people can stay in jobs.

The Premier I think just needs to get the balance right and she can do that if there's national consistency in the way in which the hotspot definition is provided for by the AHPPC and then adhered to by the Premiers. That's what I think has tried to be achieved at National Cabinet.

QUESTION:

What would you say to anyone in your electorate who might concerned about taking the AstraZeneca vaccine if they're over 65, given advice out of Germany that we don't know enough yet about whether it should be given to older people?

PETER DUTTON:

We saw some statistics out of Norway only a couple of weeks ago that there was an initial negative reaction to it and when there was a deeper dive into those figures, and what was happening there, clearly there was a problem that Norway was able to address and the issue was resolved. So I would wait to see some further evidence come out of Germany.

The most important point I'd make, not just to people in my electorate, but across the country, is that this Government has acted in the Australian interest. We've acted to keep Australians safe and we'll continue to do that. We will not make a decision that is going to put the health of Australians at risk.

Greg Hunt has demonstrated that he has been and remains a phenomenal Health Minister, backed up by Brendan Murphy and Paul Kelly and others. We have not only the best health system in the world, but the best system of approval of medicines and

vaccinations. Australians have great trust in our doctors, in our scientists and the TGA and others are advising us and the public at the moment, the vaccine is safe to take. That is based off all of their best judgements over a long period of time.

It's important to point out that we haven't rushed the approval process, as Anthony Albanese wanted us to, for this very reason. We want to look at the world experience. If we need to make assessments, if we need to make judgements, we can do that with all of that evidence, but I think it's incumbent on the media, as well as it is on the Opposition, to talk in a calm way with the Australian public because people at the moment need reassurance. The Government's providing that reassurance. We're doing it on the best available advice, the best advice in the world from Australian scientists and doctors in the TGA process and I think people should be reassured by that.

QUESTION:

How likely is it that the Australia-New Zealand travel bubble will continue beyond Sunday? And do you believe there will be two-way travel between Australia and New Zealand this year?

PETER DUTTON:

I hope that there would be two-way travel and that was the idea originally of the bubble.

Prime Minister Ardern has made a decision that that's not the case and we respect that decision. But obviously, the AHPPC made up not only of the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer, but all the health chief medical officers, provided advice to the Government that they were worried about the strain that had presented in New Zealand. I think they made a very prudent decision to put in place a 72-hour stop on travel from the Green Zone and they've extended that because there are other cases that have come out of hotel quarantine and they obviously liaise very closely with their New Zealand counterparts.

So I hope that we can get back to normal as soon as possible, but they were particularly worried about that strain, they were worried about the way in which it presented itself, the time at which it presented itself and where people are asymptomatic it makes it difficult to make an early call, obviously.

They will work very closely with the health professionals in New Zealand and again, I think we’ve been well served by the Chief Medical Officers in Australia. They've provided us with good advice and we should continue to adhere to it.

QUESTION:

How concerning are the allegations of foul play related to bets on the Australian of the Year Awards?

PETER DUTTON:

4/5

I had a discussion with the CEO of the ACIC the other day, Mike Phelan, and he advised me that there was concern, and obviously that now has been made public. If anybody has any information, they should contact Crime Stoppers or contact the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission to provide that evidence.

It is a very serious matter when you have a betting market of any description and there are irregular movements. The ACIC works with the Australian Sports Commission and others, including the Australian Federal Police, to make sure that they stamp it out.

Australians enjoy a bet, they want to make sure that when they're placing a bet, it's on a fair market, that it’s not rigged, that it’s not corrupt and there are allegations here that need to be investigated and Mike Phelan is very capable of investigating that matter.

QUESTION:

Can I ask one more?

PETER DUTTON:

Yeah sure.

QUESTION:

Do you believe Anthony Albanese will be leading Labor to the election?

PETER DUTTON:

Look I don't and this is a matter for the Labor Party, obviously. The problem is not the leader or the leader in waiting in Tanya Plibersek, but the problem is in the policies. I mean the Labor Party is promising to jack up electricity prices. They're promising to put a carbon tax in place. They're promising to lose thousands of jobs through the policies, which is why the unions have now turned on Anthony Albanese and they're a very unhappy camp.

So the band-aid that Anthony Albanese's just applied to the shark bite is not going to cut it. Giving Richard Marles extra responsibility to try and keep him in the tent as well, I think long term is not going to work either.

Anthony Albanese has a huge problem on his hands. He's got disunity. He's got people who are undermining him. You had Tanya Plibersek putting out her vision only a couple of days ago. Jim Chalmers doing the same today by way of his op-ed and the problems will continue because the fundamentals for Labor are wrong at the moment. Australians want a government that can deliver jobs. That's exactly what our Government is absolutely focussed on and in the middle of a pandemic when the Government is focussed on keeping Australians safe and keeping Australians in jobs, the Labor Party is tearing themselves apart and they're only worried about their own jobs.
