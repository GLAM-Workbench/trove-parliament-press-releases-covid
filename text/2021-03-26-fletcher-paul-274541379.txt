$20 million for independent cinemas to keep their doors open

The Morrison Government is committing $20 million to assist independent cinema operators.

The Supporting Cinemas’ Retention Endurance and Enhancement of Neighbourhoods (SCREEN)  Fund, administered by Screen Australia, will assist independent cinema operators who have  experienced significant declines in revenue due to the pandemic, with one-off business continuity  grants of up to $85,000.

Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cites and the Arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher MP,  said the SCREEN Fund is expected to support up to 390 cinemas across the country manage the  significant economic, health and social challenges they are facing as a result of COVID-19.

“The pandemic has had a devastating impact on cinemas, who have struggled to recover due to  circumstances that were out of their control, such as capacity restrictions and a reduced flow of new  release films by major distributors,” Minister Fletcher said.

“Independent cinemas represent around 30 per cent of the cinema exhibition sector in Australia, and  play a key role by providing a popular, low-cost and COVID-safe way for people to go out and enjoy  a movie as part of a community - particularly in regional areas.

“We’re introducing this funding to help support the viability of independent cinemas during this  period when their business circumstances are still returning to normality, as the vaccine rollout  progresses and Australia moves towards higher audience capacities.”

The SCREEN Fund builds on the Government’s investment of over $800 million in additional arts  and entertainment funding announced in 2020, on top of its annual investment of around $750  million in regular funding.
