SHADOW MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE   MEMBER FOR FRANKLIN



GLASS JAW LITTLEPROUD MUST STEP UP ON FARM WORK SOLUTION

The Morrison Government must show national leadership to fix farm workforce shortages as  more and more states are forced to go it alone with solutions.

Over the last two days Victoria and New South Wales have both unveiled their own policies to  try and deal with farm workforce shortages forced by COVID-19 restrictions.

But the Federal Minister responsible for this issue, David Littleproud, has been missing in  action.

Minister Littleproud has been very happy to criticise states when it comes to vaccinations but  he has completely vacated the field when it comes to doing his own job.

He should be taking the lead and fixing workforce shortages on farms with a national plan.

Producers have already faced losses of more than $45 million from rotting crops due to  workforce shortages on farms.

Recent forecasts also predicted farm labour shortages will hit the hip pocket with the price of  fruit and vegetables set to rise by 7-29 per cent.

Labor has previously  written to Minister Littleproud calling for him to finally step up with a real  national plan to address gaps in Australiaâ€™s agriculture workforce.

The Morrison Government is still yet to respond to the recommendations of the National  Agricultural Workforce Strategy handed to it in October.

But Minister Littleproud and the Nationals are more interested in shameless politicking than  showing leadership for Australian farmers.

The Morrison Government has failed to take responsibility for labour shortages - farmers just  want this fixed.

Minister Littleproud should stop passing the buck and start working to fix this serious workforce  shortage or Australian produce will continue to rot on the farms.
