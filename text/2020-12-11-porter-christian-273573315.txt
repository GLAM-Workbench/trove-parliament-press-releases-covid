Contract awarded to deliver fast-tracked Mitchell Freeway Extension

The highly anticipated Mitchell Freeway Extension from Hester Avenue in Clarkson to Romeo  Road in Alkimos is a step closer with the contract awarded to the Mitchell Extension Joint  Venture (MEJV), a consortium of BMD Construction and Georgiou Group.

When complete this project, combined with the current widening works underway along the  Mitchell Freeway northbound, is expected to save drivers travelling from the Narrows Bridge to  Alkimos during the PM peak period up to 15 minutes’ travel time.

Fast-tracked to boost the economy post COVID-19, the $215 million freeway extension is  expected to support 1,200 direct and indirect jobs during construction.

Major works are expected to start in early 2021 and completion is scheduled for late 2022.

The Mitchell Freeway will be extended 5.6 kilometres and the project scope also includes:   Ã¯ÂÂ·  a new interchange at Lukin Drive including duplicating the road between Mitchell  Freeway and Connolly Drive;   Ã¯ÂÂ·  a new connection from Marmion Avenue to Wanneroo Road through the extension and

construction of a dual carriageway on Romeo Road in Alkimos;  Ã¯ÂÂ·  upgrade of Wanneroo Road to a dual carriageway road from Romeo Road to Trian  Road.

A priced option to upgrade Butler Boulevard will remain, pending further discussions.

The project will improve safety and reduce congestion on the Freeway and local road networks  within the fast growing outer northern suburbs of Yanchep, Butler, Alkimos, Eglinton and  Nowergup.

WA Premier Mark McGowan said the Mitchell Freeway extension to Alkimos would create a  pipeline of work and a huge number of jobs for Western Australians over the life of the project.

“I’m pleased that in WA our economy has roared back to life following the impacts of the  pandemic and we’ve been able to continue to get projects underway that boosts jobs and busts  congestion.

“The northern corridor is growing so being able to extend the Mitchell Freeway further north to  where many families live and work will help save them time and will make it safer for road  users.

“Like all our major projects underway, across the State, as part of our Building for Tomorrow  program of works, there will be some disruption however these are necessary to ensure we  have important and fit for purpose infrastructure for future generations to come.”



Federal Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure Alan Tudge said the Morrison  Government has prioritised critical road and rail infrastructure in WA.

“This is a congesting-busting project that will take pressure off local roads by providing a better  route from home to work and the shops.

“The Morrison Government is investing millions of dollars into major transport infrastructure  projects across WA and that means more jobs for hard working West Australians.”

WA Transport Minister Rita Saffioti said additional local road upgrades had been included in  the main construction contract, which would help ease traffic pressure on surrounding areas.

“We have also included a new interchange at Lukin Drive and a new connection from Marmion  Avenue to Wanneroo Road, which will make it easier for our northern suburbs commuters.

“Combined with our other northern suburbs projects, including the long awaited Yanchep Rail  Extension, this will support the WA economy through COVID-19 while creating and supporting  local jobs.

“We will also be optimising the performance of the Mitchell Freeway southbound from Hester  Avenue to Perth by introducing the same smart technology that has worked so well on the  Kwinana Freeway.”

Federal Member for Pearce Christian Porter said the extension would provide more  opportunities for local residents heading in and out of the City.

“The northern suburbs are booming and the population growth is only going to continue over  the next decade.

“It’s vital we deliver these much needed infrastructure upgrades now.

“I, along with my community, have been calling out for this extension so it’s fantastic to see the  project taking shape.”

State Member for Butler John Quigley said the extension would make a huge difference for  local Butler residents.

“Extending the Mitchell Freeway to Romeo Road will make travel easier and safer for northern  suburbs commuters.

“We are getting on with building the northern suburbs with millions of dollars of transport  projects underway that will create and support thousands of local jobs.”

The Mitchell Freeway Extension Project, from Hester Avenue to Romeo Road, is jointly-funded  by the Australian and State Governments, with each contributing $107.5 million.
