NAIF TO TAKE 150 YEARS TO SPEND $5 BILLION

New figures released to a Senate inquiry reveal that the Morrison Government  will take nearly 150 years to spend the $5 billion war chest held by its failed  Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund (NAIF).

No wonder the north has nicknamed the NAIF the “No Actual Infrastructure  Fund”.

In total, only $169.2 million, or 3.4% of the NAIF’s $5 billion, has been released  for projects across Northern Australia. This equates to less than $34 million in  spending for each of the NAIF’s five years.

This slow trickle of funds is shocking. An analysis of the NAIF’s annual reports  and Questions on Notice shows that over $33 million, nearly the same amount  released for projects yearly, been spent on executive and staff salaries, office  space, travel for board directors, advertising and more over the duration of the  NAIF.

This is yet another example of the Morrison Government promising a lot and  delivering little.

At a time when the north is crying out for jobs, it is a disgrace that the Morrison  Government keeps sitting on this $5 billion war chest.

The NAIF has found it much easier to spend public funds on cushy jobs and  travel perks. In the 2018-19 financial year alone, the NAIF board approved over  $1.9 million for bonuses for “key management personnel” and senior  executives, board travel costs and highly paid consultants.

More than five years after it was launched, only $1.7 million, or 0.034% of the  NAIF’s $5 billion budget has been spent in Queensland, on only project. No



funds have been released for Queensland projects in at least six months.

This means the NAIF has spent more on bonuses, travel and consultants than  it has spent on projects in Queensland.

Shockingly, the Senate inquiry also revealed that:   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ NAIF executive bonuses are not linked to the amount of funds actually  released. There is no financial incentive whatsoever to get money out  the door.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The NAIF is not interested in financing smaller aquaculture, tourism and

other projects that have potential to create jobs across Northern  Australia.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Morrison Government is reconsidering whether the NAIF is even “fit  for purpose” for the needs of Northern Australia.

The NAIF has been allowed to flounder under a succession of Ministers for  Northern Australia. Now more than ever, we need a functioning infrastructure  fund for the north.

The NAIF could play a key role in rebuilding the Northern Australia economy  following COVID-19. But it’s up to the new Minister, Keith Pitt, to make changes  to the NAIF immediately.

The NAIF’s funds have been locked up for far too long. The north cannot wait  any longer.
