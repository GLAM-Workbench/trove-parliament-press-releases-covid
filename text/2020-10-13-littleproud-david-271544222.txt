GREEN LIGHT FOR DROUGHT RELIEF PROJECT IN BOULIA

A high-priority drought relief project is progressing in the Boulia Shire in Queensland, with  $1 million in funding approved under the Australian Government’s Drought Communities  Programme (DCP) Extension.

Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management, David Littleproud said now  more than ever, the Government is proud to support regional Australia during the added  challenge of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.

“The Government is aware of the added challenges presented by COVID-19. Communities  should rest assured the Government continues to have their back, with an economic  support package of nearly $314 billion in assistance announced to date,” Minister  Littleproud said.

“This includes the $2.8 billion package to assist local government in the delivery of priority  projects with a focus on roads, community infrastructure upgrades and maintenance.

“Under this package, the $1.5 billion Local Road and Community Infrastructure Program,  and the bringing forward of $1.3 billion from the 2020-21 Financial Assistance Grant  payments will help communities battling the effects of COVID-19.”

The Boulia project will include upgrading community halls and assets; upgrading facilities  and communication capabilities at the Boulia Racecourse Reserve/Rodeo Grounds;  repairing footpaths and drains; upgrading the Min Min Encounter Tourism and Visitor  Information Centre; installing a Water Monitoring System for Urandangi water supply; and  contributing, with the Winton Shire Council and Telstra, to a small cell network connection  between Boulia and Winton.

LNP Senator for Queensland, Susan McDonald said she was pleased to see the Boulia  project is ready to move forward.

“The Australian Government is providing $1 million to the Boulia Shire Council to support the  roll out of the Boulia Shire DCP Extension 2 project,” Senator McDonald said.

“The project will provide long lasting benefits for the Boulia community which has been  significantly impacted.

“Having visited Boulia recently, I’m pleased to see the Min Min Encounter Centre will be  upgraded. This attraction features animatronic characters who tell the story of the famous  Min Min lights seen regularly in Outback Queensland.

“This and so much other work being done on community infrastructure in the town  demonstrates the Morrison Government’s commitment to regional Queensland and is a credit  to the hard work being done by Mayor Rick Britton, the local councilors and council staff.”

Minister Littleproud said DCP Extension projects, such as Boulia’s, deliver an immediate  cash injection to help keep locals employed, businesses open, money flowing through  drought-affected regional economies.

“The Government is standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our regional and rural communities  that have been doing it tough through drought and will be here to support them through  dedicated initiatives such as the DCP Extension,” he said.

“Drought doesn't just hurt farmers; it hurts small businesses and the wider community as  well, but with DCP Extension funding we can keep money flowing through areas that have  been affected.

“So far, the DCP Extension has funded nearly 500 projects, such as the construction of  local tourism assets and amenities blocks, delivery of a potable water supply, community  resilience events and employing local drought support officers.”
