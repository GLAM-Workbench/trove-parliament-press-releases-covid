Treasurer, good morning and welcome to AM.

JOSH FRYDENBERG:

Good morning Sabra.

SABRA LANE:

These figures show more than two million workers and half a million firms moved off JobKeeper by the  end of December. There are still one and a half million workers relying on it, how many of those do  you expect will still need some form of help by the end of March when the program ends?

JOSH FRYDENBERG:

Well there are still some sectors like tourism, like international education, like aviation that are  struggling and some regions as well. But what these numbers show is a broad based recovery in the  Australian labour market, much better than we expected, even through the pandemic last year. With  over two million Australians graduating from JobKeeper and over 500,000 businesses, what we are  seeing is people get back to work. It's another proof point that the economic recovery is underway, it  adds to what we've seen in the housing market, what we've seen with motor vehicle sales, what we've  seen with business and consumer confidence reaching its pre pandemic levels, and it is very  encouraging.

SABRA LANE:

As you point out, some tourism, aviation and regions aren't doing so well. Cairns, a city dependent on  international tourism, is still suffering. Borders won't lift for months, your figures show a 55 per cent fall  of people needing government assistance there. That's still thousands of workers and businesses  needing help. How soon will the government unveil its support packages for specific sectors?

JOSH FRYDENBERG:

Well the first thing to say is you're right, there has been a significant reduction in the number of people  in Cairns relying on JobKeeper. So to on the Sunshine Coast, so to on the Gold Coast and even more  than 70 per cent reduction on people relying on JobKeeper in Townsville. The key to getting those  people back to work in the tourism sector is to have open borders and what I heard from Alan Joyce  was that he cancelled 1,500 flights into Queensland alone in the month of January. Now that was  200,000 passenger bookings, that was the money that would have been spent in Cairns or in Noosa  or on Hamilton island or indeed across Brisbane or elsewhere, so we need to keep the virus under  control and when it comes specific extra government support for the tourism sector, we're considering  that right now.

JobSeeker, the special Coronavirus Supplement ends next month. The government has been

considering a permanent increase to the unemployment payment. There's a report this morning that  says the government is considering boosting the payment and streamlining a whole range of  supplements into one single payment. That was a recommendation to the government from the  McClure review in 2015. Is that accurate?

JOSH FRYDENBERG:

Well no surprise to you, Sabra, I'm not going to speculate on speculation. We have said consistently  that we'll make a decision and an announcement on the future of the Jobseeker payment before that  elevated supplement level ends in March and that is what the government is working through right  now.

SABRA LANE:

How mindful are you, in the McClure review, it suggested that the payment needed to enable  recipients to have a basic, acceptable standard of living that allows them to meet their obligations, to  look for work or study and to support children, to do all of that would seem to suggest a payment much  higher than $40 a day.

JOSH FRYDENBERG:

Well again, in terms of the rate and its future, we will consider that in the normal expenditure review  committee context and that's what we're doing right now. The best thing though, I can do as the  Treasurer, for people who are on JobSeeker, is to help them get back into the workforce. 90 per cent  of the 1.3 million Australians who lost their jobs are now back in work. We've seen the unemployment  rate fall to 6.6 per cent whereas Treasury were telling me at one stage that it could reach as high as  15 per cent. We are seeing some very encouraging signs across the economy, so if we can keep that  momentum going, bearing in mind we've got tax cuts putting more than a billion dollars a month into  peoples' pockets, that we've brought forward infrastructure spending, that we have in place 300,000  plus skills support places as well as other incentives to boost investment, all of that is going to  generate more economic activity. All of that means more jobs and all of that means people come off  JobSeeker.

SABRA LANE:

Parliament is back this week. It's going to debate the news media bargaining code to make digital  giants like Google and Facebook pay for the Australian journalism that they publish. The tech giants  have been pushing back, I understand that you've been talking with Facebook about it. Where are  those talks at?

JOSH FRYDENBERG:

Well I've been talking to both Facebook and Google over the course of the weekend as well as  working with the Prime Minister and Minister Fletcher, and the media proprietors as well, because this  is ground-breaking legislative reform. This is world-leading, there are many eyes across the world that  are focused on what Australia is doing right now. We have made great progress over the course of the  weekend. I think we're very close to some very significant commercial deals and in doing so, that will  transform the domestic media landscape. This legislation is important and it's our intention to pass it  through the parliament. We've just had a committee report that has endorsed our code and I  commend the work of the A000 and Rod Simms, who through their comprehensive work over the  course of a couple of years, have produced a framework to take us forward.

SABRA LANE:

And you personally? Have you spoken with Mark Zuckerberg?

JOSH FRYDENBERG:

Well I have, I spoke to him just yesterday and I have also been speaking as recently as this morning  as well as over the weekend with Sundar from Google, the head of Google. They are very focused on  what is happening here in Australia but I sense they are also trying to reach deals and that is welcome  because both the media proprietors and the digital giants I think recognise that we have something  that is workable here in Australia, something that we can take forward, something that can ensure a  sustainable media landscape and something that will see journalism continued and journalists  rewarded for generating original content.

SABRA LANE:

Treasurer, thanks for talking to AM this morning.

JOSH FRYDENBERG:

Thank you.
