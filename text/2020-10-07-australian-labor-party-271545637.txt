SENATOR KATY GALLAGHER  SHADOW MINISTER FOR FINANCE  SHADOW MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE  SENATOR FOR THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY





E&OE TRANSCRIPT  TELEVISION INTERVIEW  ABC NEWS 24 CAPITAL HILL  WEDNESDAY, 7 OCTOBER 2020

SUBJECT: Federal Budget.

GREG JENNETT, HOST: Before Question Time with our Senate panel today. Nationals'  Senate Leader Bridget McKenzie and Labor frontbencher, Shadow Finance Minister as  well, Katy Gallagher. Welcome to both of you. Katy, first of all to you, just on this question  of speed and efficiency. What does Labor mean when it's principal criticism here today is  about getting bang for your buck? How would you have got more?

SENATOR KATY GALLAGHER, SHADOW MINISTER FOR FINANCE: Well, obviously,  we are just looking at the budget in the first day that we've had it. And I guess what we're  seeing is a huge amount of debt and deficits for as far as the eye can see. We're still  seeing big gaps in the response from the government. So a lot of people are left behind,  unemployment remaining high for the next four years. Certainly, in that fourth year, still  higher than the pre-pandemic levels. And so I guess the obvious question, and the  reasonable question we're asking is, with all this money, are we getting the best outcomes  that we could have in the recovery, and are we bringing as many people as possible with  us? I think that is a legitimate question to raise at this point.

JENNETT: All right. We might hear some more from that on Anthony Albanese's budget  speech in reply, I suppose tomorrow. But Bridget McKenzie as a Victorian, I guess, in  recent times, recovery from recession must have felt a long, long way off. Yet, you're now  brandishing a budget that tells us it'll pretty much be over by this time or Christmas of next  year. Why does that suddenly seem so realistic to you?

SENATOR BRIDGET MCKENZIE, NATIONALS’ SENATE LEADER: Well, I think  because we're backing the ingenuity and the entrepreneurial spirit of Australians, both as  workers but also as those millions of Australians that run small businesses who really,  Greg, have been so hard hit by the COVID-19 global pandemic.  Rather than Labor's glib  clichÃÂ©s about bang for buck, I think our budget absolutely delivers in spades, in the key  areas that have taken the hit during COVID-19, backs our competitive advantage, and  really seeks to focus on one economic indicator and that's getting more Australians back  into jobs. Because we know that that will then mean we've got wages going through our  local economies, keeping small businesses employed, and supporting families to get back  on their feet.



JENNETT: Now, Katy, it's clear that young people are going to be targeted with this wage  subsidy which Labor's supporting. But what about a further breakdown, a gender  breakdown, within the ranks of the unemployed here? I think there's conflicting evidence  and views down at Treasury and in the ABS statistics about whether we're in a pink  recession or not. Whether women have been disproportionately and adversely affected.  There's one view that they're actually not right now. For that reason, do you think women  should have been more specifically targeted or are you happy with the settings as they  are?

GALLAGHER: Absolutely. And I think this is one of our points when we're saying bang for  buck. And I reject some of what Bridget just said. But there's no doubt that women have  been incredibly affected and in the early stages, disproportionately. They lost more jobs,  because they were in the part time jobs. They've picked up more of the caring  responsibilities both for childcare and for elderly parents. So there is absolutely no doubt  that women have been adversely affected in this pandemic. And the budget provides no  plan for them, no plan to return them to the workforce, no way to support higher female  participation in the labour market. It's a real gap, as is the one that's been drawn now,  between those who are under 35 and those over 35. You know, we have three and a half  million people on JobKeeper. We've got 1.6 million on JobSeeker. And almost a million of  them on JobSeeker, on the unemployment queue at the moment, are over 35 and this  budget doesn't speak to them. So it is leaving them behind.

JENNETT: All right. Bridget , women or people aged over 35. Who is worse off here in the  untargeted category?

MCKENZIE: Yeah, Greg, look, I completely, categorically reject that this is a budget for  blokes. Women are going to be recipients and advantaged by our whole range of programs  from JobKeeper, to a fantastic initiative to really support young women and men into  apprenticeships right across the country. So we haven't taken a gendered lens to this  budget at all.

GALLAGHER: You needed too.

MCKENZIE: But Katy, I do take that on board that women have been affected, given the  types of work that they have typically undertaken in our communities. And that's why we  actually have put forward a plan in this budget to address increasing workforce  participation, supporting female leaders and role models, specific programs about how  women can better balance their caring and their work responsibilities. And our women's  economic statement maps that out, and we've put real money behind it. So for Labor to  come out, again, with tried talking points, really means just get the budget papers, happy to  walk you through them, because we have got a plan for getting women back into the  workforce and being able to juggle what is often really significant dual responsibilities.

JENNETT: All right. Let me walk you through the trillion dollar question. I'm going to start  with you, Bridget. At what point did you accept, fully, the need to retire the old GFC rhetoric  about deficit disasters and embrace this record number? We're heading towards a trillion  dollars here - $213. You've crossed the Rubicon here.

MCKENZIE: Well, that's what has to happen if you're going to win wars. You have to cross  the Rubicon. And I think that...

JENNETT: You have no compassion about that? You don't feel guilty about this?

GALLAGHER: Only Liberal ones.

MCKENZIE: Thanks, Katy. Look, the reality is if we compare our economy and our budget  that we've just handed down and these numbers globally, we are doing very, very well. We  have to really recognize the point in history that our nation is in. This is a global pandemic.  It has decimated nations, economically, but also from a health perspective, right across the  world. It will continue to do so. I think our Federal government, in conjunction with many of  our State governments too, around the country, has done the very best they can to  balance both the economic impact of the pandemic and also providing positive health  impacts. So yes, big numbers, it's going to take a long time to pay back. But also we had to  do what had to be done in the face of an unprecedented global pandemic. And I think  we've done well.

JENNETT: All right, well, Katy, that might be about as close to a mea culpa as you get.  We're all in this together. Debt and deficit is the new normal, I suppose, and you prepared  to bury the hatchet on that war, which has raged for fully 12 years now?

GALLAGHER: Well, I don't think it's one, you know, that's the priority for the Australian  people. That's what we've focused on, jobs, what needs to be done in the economy. We've  been consistent all the time around debt and deficit. That is you use your budget, when  you need to, to invest in the community, protect jobs, protect people. At times of global  uncertainty, you need to do that. We did in the GFC. We know what the Liberals' called our  management of the economy then, that it was a disaster. But now it's completely  manageable. I'll leave it to the people of Australia to work out who's been the hypocrite  there. But the priority has to be on saving jobs, protecting jobs, getting people into training,  and making sure people can put food on the table. That's our view.

JENNETT: And no one Bridget seems to be making any suggestions about the word  surplus. And when one of those might come back. I mean, do you see it happening in your  political career?

MCKENZIE: Well, I can only go to my communities and see the impact of the COVID-19  pandemic, right across regions and our capital cities. People want job security, they want  to move forward into a recovery phase with confidence. That's what this budget gives  them. And I'm really excited that Labor will join us in supporting this on jobs. Katy, on jobs.

GALLAGHER: Because the answer to that Greg is no surplus. No surplus, I think, is your  answer to that.

MCKENZIE: Well, right now there's only one economic indicator that counts and it's  employment.

GALLAGHER: It's not clear. I mean, we usually we get bought in by the government pretty  late in the piece if they want to get things through the Senate. We work pretty cooperatively  where we can. We've certainly given an indication on the tax cuts that we support them.  We understand the government wants to push things through the House this week. It's not  clear to me whether it'll be able to clear the Senate. But if the government, you know,  engages with us, we might learn a bit more.

JENNETT: It does seem a way off, doesn't it? Finally, Katy Gallagher, because I think it's



your day job to keep an eye on these things. Process for those who don't follow the Senate  particularly closely, how much of the budget measures, do you think we'll have cleared the  entire Parliament by the end of this week? All right. Well, yes at least there is bipartisan  agreement on most of those crucial measures. Now, you do have to get to Question Time.  So I will thank both of you, Bridget McKenzie, and Katy Gallagher for joining us on this  historic moment.

GALLAGHER: Thanks Greg.

MCKENZIE: Thanks Greg.

JENNETT: We do have to remind ourselves, don't we, the times we're living in. Thanks so  much, Senators.
