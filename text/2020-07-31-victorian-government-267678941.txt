St Basil’s aged care residents transferred to  hospital  The Victorian Aged Care Response Centre (VACRC) is working closely with Victorian  authorities and St Basil’s Home for the Aged to relocate all remaining residents to hospitals  in order to contain the COVID-19 outbreak at the facility in Fawkner, Melbourne.

The decision was made co-operatively between Commonwealth and Victorian officials.

Ambulances and healthcare professionals have attended St Basil’s this morning to facilitate  the transfer of the remaining 30 residents to several hospitals across Melbourne.

The decision was made to transfer residents to hospitals due to a reduction in staff numbers at  St Basil’s. Six staff at St Basil’s have tested positive for COVID-19, and as a precautionary  measure all staff have been instructed to be tested and self-isolate for a mandatory period.

Executive Officer of the VACRC Joe Buffone acknowledged the extremely difficult  circumstances faced by the residents of St Basil’s and their families.

“The Response Centre’s highest priority is keeping the aged care residents safe, minimising  the spread of the virus, the safety of staff and saving lives.

“This is about ensuring high quality care for St Basil’s residents during this challenging  time,” Mr Buffone said.

The families of residents are being contacted to ensure they are aware of the transfers.
