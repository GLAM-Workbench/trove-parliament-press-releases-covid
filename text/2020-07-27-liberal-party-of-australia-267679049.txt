$27 million to boost research in preventive and public health

The Morrison Government continues to invest in vital research to help promote better health  and prevent people from getting ill.

Our Government is investing $27 million in 22 preventive and public health projects through  the landmark $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF).

This funding will enable research teams across Australia to look at new ways to prevent  people from getting ill. Telehealth will have a key role in a number of these projects.

The new research will concentrate on vulnerable groups, mothers, babies and children, with a  focus on improving diet, nutrition and physical activity.

One of the key projects will look at using telehealth to address developmental impairments in  very preterm babies as well as their parents’ wellbeing.

Every year approximately 5000 babies are born very preterm - at less than 32 weeks - in  Australia.

Many of them will go on to have developmental impairments in later childhood, such as  motor, cognitive or academic difficulties.

A great concern is that parents of preterm infants can have high rates of anxiety and  depression and this can also affect child development.

Intervention in the first year of life is the best chance of avoiding long-term disabilities.

The University of Melbourne will receive more than $1.8 million to trial the remote ‘tele-rehabilitation’ service over the internet so families can get help in their home, no matter their  circumstances or location.

Telehealth services have helped 8 million Australians receive essential health care and advice  during the COVID-19 pandemic. GPs have provided more than 13.5 million telehealth  services, supporting patients who are self-isolating to control the spread of COVID-19.

Our Government is profoundly committed to strengthening and expanding access to life  saving services.
