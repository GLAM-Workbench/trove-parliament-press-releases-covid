Coronavirus and higher education

Statement from Minister for Education Dan Tehan:

The National Security Committee of Cabinet (NSC) met this afternoon to discuss the  evolving novel coronavirus crisis. The NSC considered advice provided by the Australian  Public Health Crisis Committee (AHPPC).

AHPPC agreed on the following:  Ã¯ÂÂ· To expand the case definition for novel coronavirus infection from 1 February 2020 to  apply to people from all of mainland China;  Ã¯ÂÂ· Recommend to DFAT to now increase travel advisory to level 4 - do not travel to all

of mainland China;  Ã¯ÂÂ· As of today, all travellers arriving out of mainland China (not just Hubei province) be  asked to self-isolate for a period of 14 days from the time they leave mainland China;

and

Ã¯ÂÂ· That to substantially reduce the volume of travellers coming from mainland China,  AHHPC recommends additional border measures be implemented to deny entry to  Australia to people who have left mainland China from 1 February, with the exception  of Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family and air crews  who have been using appropriate personal protective equipment. This also applies to  transit passengers who are not Australian Citizens or permanent residents.

The Government has agreed to accept this advice. As a result, I will be meeting with the  board of Universities Australia on Monday to discuss options to work with the sector to  minimise the impacts of this decision on Australia’s international education providers. I have  also asked the Council for International Education’s Global Reputation Taskforce to convene  on Monday to discuss this advice and any necessary responses.

The Government will work with the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency and  the Australian Skills Quality Authority to ensure providers can offer on-line and remote  alternatives while the advice of the AHPPC remains in place.

I appreciate the willingness of the university sector to work with the government to manage  this public health emergency. The safety of all Australians remains our Government’s  number one priority.
