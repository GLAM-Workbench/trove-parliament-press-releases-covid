INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIANS ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE -  HERE’S WHAT WE CAN DO

Indigenous Australians are disproportionately vulnerable to serious infection from COVID-19 because of high rates of chronic illness.

In many instances, over-crowding in housing presents a further risk factor.

Reports today that people in remote communities are still being required to participate in  Community Development Program group work, despite strict restrictions on movement, are  particularly concerning.

There is important work being done to protect Indigenous communities by both  government and non-government organisations, but there are further measures which can  be undertaken.

There are simple and reasonable steps the Government can take to protect Indigenous  communities, by ensuring:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Proper and accurate information in relation to hygiene practices and public  gatherings is reaching Indigenous communities, including in language if

appropriate and necessary;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Travel to remote communities is appropriately regulated and clearly and uniformly  applied among states and territories;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The social security system remains accessible and flexible to the rapidly changing

circumstances prompted by the spread of COVID-19, including the suspension of  Job Active and Community Development Program mutual obligation activities.  People should not be placed in harm’s way, or risk infecting others, because they  are worried the Government will cut their payment off;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continuous and comprehensive consultation with Indigenous community

organisations and media so that information and procedures are culturally  appropriate. Community leaders should also be informed and supported to  reconsider the need for cultural events which can draw large numbers of members  of the community; and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Government response consider and reflect the unique challenges in these

communities - urban; suburban; rural and remote.   Labor is prepared to work constructively with the Government to meet these objectives.
