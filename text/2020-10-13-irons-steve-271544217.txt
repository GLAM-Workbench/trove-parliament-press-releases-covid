SIGNIFICANT BOOST FOR SKILLS TRAINING IN WESTERN  AUSTRALIA

The Commonwealth Government and the WA State Government have launched the Western  Australian JobTrainer Agreement.

An extra $103.4 million is being injected into Western Australia’s vocational education and  training (VET) sector, with $51.7 million from the Commonwealth Government matched  dollar-for-dollar by the WA Government.

This will fund free or low-fee training places in Western Australia, with a combination of  short and long courses for job seekers, and young people, including school leavers.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said the funding will be an important boost to a skills-led recovery in Western  Australia.

“JobTrainer will play a central role in our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, not just  here in Western Australia but right across the nation,” Minister Cash said.

“I thank the WA State Government for signing up to this important initiative.”

“The Commonwealth Government has been working closely with jurisdictions to establish  the $1 billion JobTrainer Fund, including a $500 million investment from the Australian  Government to be matched by the state and territory governments.”

“This will fund up to 340,700 additional free or low-fee training places to help Australians  upskill and reskill in areas of demand.”

Western Australia State Minister for Education and Training, Sue Ellery MLC, said this is a  fantastic result for WA and will ensure more people can upskill and reskill for work.

“We know skills and training will play a crucial role in our State’s economic recovery post  COVID-19,” Minister Ellery said.

“Western Australia’s plan is focused on ensuring a diversity of training options linked to jobs  growth and investing in apprenticeships and traineeships so we have the skilled workforce for  the jobs now and into the future.

Assistant Minister for Vocational Education, Training and Apprenticeships, the Hon Steve  Irons MP, said the Australian Government is committed to strengthening the VET system to  get Australians into work.

“We’re investing $6.5 billion in VET in 2020-21 to provide valuable opportunities and skills  to Australians and help drive the nation’s prosperity in the years to come,” Minister Irons  said.

“This includes additional funding under the Supporting Apprentices and Trainees wage  subsidy, which has provided more than $500 million to employers across Australia since  March this year.

“Of this, the Government has to date assisted 3,684 employers to retain 6,301 apprentices and  trainees in Western Australia.”
