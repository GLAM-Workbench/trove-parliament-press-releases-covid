BETTER HAND SANITISER INFORMATION TO KEEP  COVIDSAFE

Consumers will be able to better identify the effectiveness of different hand sanitiser products under  new laws designed to help Australians stay COVIDsafe.

The Morrison Government has accepted the recommendations of the Australian Competition and  Consumer Commission (ACCC) that requires hand sanitiser manufactures to improve product  information and safety.

The new Consumer Goods (Cosmetics) Information Standard 2020 includes specific requirements for  alcohol-based hand sanitisers to display the percentage of alcohol contained in the product, as well  as safe use and storage warning information.

The Department of Health recommends hand sanitiser be used during the COVID-19 pandemic  when soap and water is not available for washing hands. Research has shown that hand sanitisers  need to contain between 60 and 80 per cent alcohol to be effective against the virus.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for hand sanitisers has significantly increased.

As the use of hand sanitisers becomes more routine, consumers need to be able to identify hand  sanitisers that are effective against COVID-19 and have full confidence that the product they buy  works.

The Morrison Government expects suppliers to provide safe and effective hand sanitiser products,  in appropriate packaging, with relevant warnings at all times.

The ACCC is also investigating allegations that some hand sanitiser suppliers have made false or  misleading claims about alcohol content.

Manufacturers of hand sanitiser have been given 180 days to transition to the new labelling  requirements.
