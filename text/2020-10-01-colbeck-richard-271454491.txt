Government welcomes Aged Care Royal Commission’s  COVID-19 report recommendations

The Australian Government has welcomed the COVID-19 report from the Royal  Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, which has been tabled in the  Australian Parliament today.

On this 30th anniversary of the International Day of Older Persons, the Australian Government  welcomes the COVID-19 report from the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety,  which has been tabled in the Australian Parliament today.

The Royal Commission’s report tells us the COVID-19 pandemic has been the greatest challenge  Australia’s aged care sector has faced and makes six recommendations to better prepare the aged  care sector, its staff and residents for any future outbreaks.

The Government accepts all six recommendations in the report and has already made substantial  progress on four of them.

The recommendations build on the Government’s existing COVID-19 measures.

The Government will invest $40.6 million in our initial response to the Royal Commission’s report  and recommendations.

It has been continuously building and adapting the National Response Plan for COVID-19 in aged  care since January 2020, with the aged care sector and with state and territory governments and  health authorities, incorporating lessons learned from Australia and other countries.

We have invested more than $1.6 billion to support senior Australians in aged care since the start of  the COVID-19 pandemic. The investment includes an additional $734.8 million announced in  August to extend support for the sector’s response to the pandemic as part of the aged care response  plan.

Wherever there are high rates of community transmission, the risk to older people and particularly  those in residential aged care increases as demonstrated in Victoria.

Recommendations:

Recommendation 1

The Government accepts the recommendation.

It will report to Parliament by no later than 1 December 2020 on the implementation of the Royal  Commission’s recommendations.

Recommendation 2

The Government accepts the recommendation.

The Government has announced two packages to provide additional funding for staffing which  supports visitations to aged care facilities by families and friends of residents.

In August, the Government committed an additional $245 million to support providers with  COVID-19 related costs, including supporting communication with families and managing  visitation arrangements, building on the first payment of the COVID supplement of $205 million  announced in May.

The Government is also providing $12.5 million to support residents and their families with  enhanced advocacy services and increased availability of grief and trauma services associated with  a COVID-19 outbreak.

In addition, the Government will bring forward the introduction of the Serious Incident Response  Scheme (SIRS) and invest an additional $29.8 million in the SIRS for residential aged care.

Legislation to support SIRS will be introduced to parliament in the spring sitting for the scheme to  commence in early 2021.

This builds on earlier investments totalling $26.3 million to establish the system for reporting abuse  or serious incidents in aged care facilities.

As part of the SIRS, residential aged care providers will be required to manage all incidents, with a  focus on the safety and wellbeing of consumers and reducing preventable incidents from  reoccurring.

Reporting under the SIRS will include a broader range of incidents, including neglect,  psychological and emotional abuse and inappropriate use of physical or chemical restraint.

Significantly, the SIRS will also lift the current exemption on the reporting of resident-on-resident  incidents, where the perpetrator has an assessed cognitive impairment.

As the Royal Commission Interim Report states: “Informal carers, often family members who  supplement the care provided in aged care homes, also play a critical role as the ‘eyes and ears’ -  monitoring the quality of care their loved ones receive.”

The SIRS will provide an additional level of assurance when facilities, due to COVID-19, will still  need to place a level of restrictions on visitations.

Recommendation 3

The Government accepts the recommendation.

While the Government has introduced a range of measures to support the mental health of residents  of aged care facilities, it will continue to implement further measures.

The Government will provide additional funding to support increased access by residents to allied  health services during the pandemic and will work with the sector to design and implement these  measures.

Recommendation 4

The Government accepts the recommendation.

The Government has a specific national plan for aged care - the CDNA Guidelines for the  Management of Outbreaks in Residential Care, which has been updated on two occasions, and  which augments the Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus  (COVID-19).

The national plan for aged care will continue to be updated incorporating the latest available  information and released soon as Stage 7 of the National COVID-19 Aged Care Plan for the  consideration by National Cabinet.

The Aged Care Advisory Group, established on 21 August 2020 under the Australian Health  Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC), will be made permanent.

The other elements of this recommendation have already been undertaken or are in progress and  will also be put to National Cabinet for consideration.

Recommendation 5

The Government accepts the recommendation.

Funding totalling $245 million will be paid to providers from October 2020 to support  COVID-19 efforts.

It will mandate that aged care providers have trained infection control officers as detailed in this  recommendation.

In addition, the Government today announces it will invest a further $10.8 million to enhance the  skills and leadership qualities of aged care nurses to ensure older Australians receive the best care  possible.

This investment will expand the Australian College of Nursing scholarship program, establish an  Aged Care Transition to Practice Program, and create a skills development program for nurses and  personal care workers in aged care.

Recommendation 6

The Government accepts the recommendation.

The Government has been working with state and territory governments to implement a decision of  National Cabinet of 21 August to implement additional face-to-face infection control training and  establish joint approaches to the management of outbreaks.

The Government thanks Australia’s frontline aged care workers and Commonwealth, state and  territory public health officials. We are deeply aware of the tragic losses that followed the global  pandemic and community transmission.

Page 4 of 10





Every life lost to the pandemic is a tragedy.

But the collective efforts of our health workers and health officials and our COVID-19 Aged Care  Plan have helped save thousands of lives and placed Australia at the forefront of the global response  to COVID-19.

The Government’s actions to protect aged care have been and continue to be based on four key  pillars:

Minimise Community Transmission

Controlling community transmission is the best defence we have in protecting vulnerable older Australians  in aged care. Under the auspices of the Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel  Coronavirus (COVID-19) action is being taken by the Commonwealth, states and territories to minimise  community transmission including through:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Minimising the spread of the disease into and across Australia including through quarantine  arrangements and effective contact tracing and tracking

Ã¯ÂÂ· Preparing the health system for increased numbers of patients

Ã¯ÂÂ· Managing COVID-19 cases

Ã¯ÂÂ· Improving understanding of the virus and how it is transmitted

Ã¯ÂÂ· Provision of information to help manage the risk of exposure and reduce spread

Ã¯ÂÂ· Vaccination - consideration of the aged care sector in a potential COVID-19 vaccine program

Surge workforce

The Government is providing critical surge workforce support to residential aged care facilities impacted by  a COVID-19 outbreak. To date, more than 33,000 shifts have been filled by a Commonwealth-funded surge  workforce including GPs, nurses, care workers, allied health workers, executive and ancillary staff.

The Victorian Aged Care Response Centre (VACRC), a joint initiative of the Commonwealth and Victorian  Government, was established on 25 July 2020 to co-ordinate and expand resources to tackle the challenge of  COVID-19 in residential aged care services.

Under the direction of the VACRC, clinical health staff provided through health services are also assisting to  fill critical workforce shortages in residential aged care facilities, with 4,778 shifts filled to date. The  VACRC has also assisted the aged care response to COVID-19 through the following activities:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel have visited 592 aged care facilities.

Ã¯ÂÂ· 40 personnel from AUSMAT have completed 174 visits to 80 facilities.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Western Health has provided assistance in prevention measures at 37 aged care facilities.

Ã¯ÂÂ· 12 National Aged Care Emergency Response (NACER) teams, 76 personnel have been deployed to  fill roles across the sector, including nursing, personal care, and cleaning.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Deployment of TAS, WA, and SA government teams to support operations in residential aged care  facilities.

Ã¯ÂÂ· 101 Residential Aged Care Assistants and Safety Observers have been deployed by the Response  Centre to 24 facilities.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Regular Zoom meetings are being conducted with staff at aged care facilities to assist with return to  work arrangements.

Public and private hospitals agreement

These historic agreements between the Commonwealth and each state and territory government  alongside the private hospital sector, has ensured the full resources of Australia’s world class health  system could be directed to the care of those who needed it.  The $1.7 billion private hospital



Page 5 of 10





agreement has been instrumental in enabling more than 500 aged care residents to be transferred to  private hospitals during the current Victorian second wave.

In addition, it has supported the in-reach of services from hospitals to aged care facilities to provide  further clinical care.

Since February 2020, the Government has been working with the states and territories to ensure  aged care facilities have sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment. To date, the National  Medical Stockpile has provided aged care facilities with approximately:

Ã¯ÂÂ· 17 million masks

Ã¯ÂÂ· 4 million gowns

Ã¯ÂÂ· 11 million gloves

Ã¯ÂÂ· 4 million goggles and face shields

Ã¯ÂÂ· 85,000 bottles of hand sanitiser

Ã¯ÂÂ· 160,000 clinical waste bags.



Universal testing of staff and residents

Immediate testing is provided to staff and residents in a facility to seek to minimise a potential  outbreak.  Through this in-reach program, more than 152,000 tests at more than 11,000 site visits to  2,000 aged care facilities across Australia have been undertaken.  The Government has also  provided Medicare funded bulk-billed testing for aged care workers, including those who are  asymptomatic.  As Victoria starts to recover, this testing will be bolstered to safeguard against a risk  of further outbreaks.

Additional investments to support the reform of the aged care sector will be announced as part of  the Government’s 2020-21 Budget, to be delivered on 6 October.

Following a request from the Royal Commission, the Government agreed to extend its reporting  period for a further three-and-a-half months due to the impact of COVID-19. This enabled the  Royal Commission to examine the initial impact of COVID-19 on aged care and the response to  date.

We thank the Commissioners for the COVID-19 report and for their work so far, and look forward  to receiving their Final Report in February next year.

A summary of the measures to support the aged care sector and key activities undertaken by the  Australian Government since the start of the pandemic is attached.
