UNCERTAINTY OVER FUTURE OF TELEHEALTH



Once again, uncertainty hangs over the future of telehealth.



In November, Health Minister Greg Hunt said, “telehealth will become a permanent

part of the medicare system,” but the arrangements will end in three weeks, on 31

March, if not extended.



AMA President, Dr Omar Khorshid said, “The current uncertainty over the future of

temporary COVID 19 Medicare telehealth items means that patients and practices

can't plan consultations beyond the end of this month, even though we are still in

the middle of the pandemic.



“Telehealth remains fundamental to our national efforts to contain the spread of

COVID-19 and ending the temporary arrangements in a couple of weeks would be

premature.”



Telehealth has played a critically important role in managing Australian’s physical

and mental health during the pandemic - especially for those in regional and

remote communities.



Scott Morrison as Acting Health Minister must urgently extend the telehealth



measures.
