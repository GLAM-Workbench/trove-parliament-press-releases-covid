DEPUTY PM REPEATEDLY IGNORES AUSTRALIAâ€™S AIRPORTS

Evidence delivered at the Senate Select Committee on COVID-19 today has revealed the  extraordinary fact that the Deputy PM and his department have not even bothered to  respond to multiple letters from the Australian Airports Association regarding much needed  aviation support.

In his evidence, the CEO of the AAA, James Goodwin said the Association had written to  the Deputy PM and his department on at least five occasions since March requesting  specific assistance, but has failed to receive any formal response or even an  acknowledgment of receipt.

If the Deputy Prime Minister cannot be bothered engaging with the industry, he should  hand over to someone who will.

With Qantas today reporting a loss of $2 billion, airports reporting collective losses of $300  per month, and capital city airports such as Canberra and Hobart being forced to close on  certain days the industry cannot wait.

Airlines, airports and unions are united in calling for a national aviation plan, the Morrison  Government must listen.
