MEDIA RELEASE  JOBSEEKER

Rising unemployment rate underlines need to keep full rate of

Coronavirus supplement and commit to long term increase in Jobseeker

October unemployment figures clearly show that it is untenable to return

Jobseeker back to $40 a day in March and that the further cut to the

coronavirus supplement in December will drop more people below the poverty

line.

It’s just excuse after excuse with this Government when it comes to the

Jobseeker payment, Greens spokesperson on Family and Community and

Services, Senator Rachel Siewert said.

Jobseeker was too low before this pandemic, so the “wait to see the economic

conditions” excuse doesn't stand up.

It is cruel to keep people in limbo on what their fates will be after March.

Keeping Jobseeker above the poverty line is essential for people looking for

work, for our communities and our economy.

It is very clear that if the Jobkeeper program ends there will be another jump in

unemployment and these figures mask the people who have dropped out of the

job market all together.

What the Government is doing to people on income support is cruel and
