PETER DUTTON DENIES BORDER FORCE OFFICERS  CORONAVIRUS SICK LEAVE

Reports today reveal casual Australian Border Force (ABF) officers responsible  for protecting Australia’s borders from the coronavirus have been denied  additional sick leave if they become infected, or have to self-isolate, as a result  of being exposed to Covid-19.

Peter Dutton’s Department of Home Affairs has granted coronavirus-related  sick leave for their full time ABF officers - choosing to entrench a double  standard for their casual staff.

There are 850 casual employees in the Department of Home Affairs including  some 150 at Sydney airport alone.

By Home Affairs’ own admission, these ABF casuals are on the frontline -  interacting with and processing arrivals into Australia - and will also be relied  upon as new stricter border protection measures are rolled out across  Australian airports.

These revelations come after Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter said  last week, “the purpose of casual employment is that you’re paid extra in-lieu of  the types of entitlements.”

Coronavirus can’t tell the difference between a casual or a fulltime worker and



casual ABF officers should have access to the same coronavirus sick leave as  their full time counterparts - it’s that simple.

Peter Dutton is asking his ABF officers to protect Australians from coronavirus  - the least he can do is help protect them, their families and their pay packets.

Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton can, and should, fix this problem today.
