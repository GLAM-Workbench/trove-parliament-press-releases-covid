*As published in the 2020- 21  MYEFO. (a) Cash receipts for operating activities and sales of non- financial assets. (b) Cash payments for operating activities, purchases of non- financial assets and net cash flows from financing activities for leases. (c) Net worth is calculated as total assets minus total liabilities. (d) Net debt is the sum of interest bearing liabilities less the sum of selected financial assets (cash and deposits, advances paid, and  investments, loans and placements).



Monthly results are generally volatile due to timing differences between revenue and receipts, and  expenses and payments. Care needs to be taken when comparing monthly or cumulative data  across years and to full-year estimates, as revenue and receipts and expenses and payments vary  from month to month.



FISCAL OUTCOMES

Underlying Cash Balance  The underlying cash balance for the financial year to 28 February 2021 was a deficit of  $134.6 billion, which is $23.1 billion lower than the 2020-21 MYEFO profile deficit of  $157.7 billion.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Receipts  Total receipts were $10.7 billion higher than the 2020-21 MYEFO profile.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Payments  Total payments were $12.3 billion lower than the 2020-21 MYEFO profile.

Net Operating Balance   The net operating balance for the year to 28 February 2021 was a deficit of $129.7 billion, which  is $26.4 billion lower than the 2020-21 MYEFO profile deficit of $156.1 billion. The difference  results from higher than expected revenue and lower than expected expenses.

Fiscal Balance  The fiscal balance for the year to 28 February 2021 was a deficit of $132.6 billion, which is  $27.8 billion lower than the 2020-21 MYEFO profile deficit of $160.4 billion. The difference  results from higher than expected revenue, and lower than expected expenses and net capital  investment.

(a) Consistent with the Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Government Finance Statistics (GFS) classification, other employee related expenses are reported  under other operating expenses.  Total employee expenses equal wages and salaries plus other operating expenses. (b) From 2020- 21, the value of Debt Not Expected to be Repaid on initial recognition of income contingent concessional loans is reported as Other Financing  costs  rather than as a valuation adjustment. This change is consistent with Australian Accounting Standards and brings the accounting treatment of income  contingent concessional loans into line with other concessional loans. (c) Operating result under Australian Accounting Standards. (d) The term fiscal balance is not used by the ABS.

*As published in the 2020- 21  MYEFO. (a) For budget reporting purposes, a discount rate of 5 per cent determined by actuaries in preparing the 2017 Long Term Cost Reports is  used to value the superannuation liability. This reflects the average annual rate estimated to apply over the term of the liability and it  reduces the volatility in reported liabilities that would occur from year to year if the spot rates on long- term government bonds were used.  Consistent with Australian Accounting Standards, the superannuation liability for the 2020- 21 Monthly Financial Statements was  calculated using the spot rates on long- term government bonds as at 30 June 2020 that best matched each individual scheme’s liability  duration. These rates were between 1.0 and 1.7 per cent per annum. (b) Net worth equals total assets minus total liabilities. (c) Net financial worth equals total financial assets minus total liabilities.  (d) Net financial liabilities equals total liabilities less financial assets other than investments in other public sector entities. (e) Net debt is the sum of interest bearing liabilities less the sum of selected financial assets (cash and deposits, advances paid, and  investments, loans and placements).

NOTES:

AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting (AASB 1049)  The Australian Government monthly financial statements have been prepared on a basis consistent with the  Budget as required under section 47 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013.  The statements are prepared in accordance with AASB 1049, which require treatment based on the Australian  Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) Government Finance Statistics (GFS) except where Australian Accounting  Standards (AAS) provide a better conceptual treatment for specific items. Departures are limited to  complying with either ABS GFS or AAS.

AASB 16 Leases (AASB 16)

The new Australian Accounting Standard, AASB 16, applied to all Australian Government entities from  1 July 2019. AASB 16 introduced a single lease accounting framework for lessees and removed the  distinction between operating and finance leases. As a result, new assets and liabilities have been recognised  on the balance sheet for leases that were previously accounted for as operating expenses. The reduction in  operating lease expenses is replaced with the depreciation charge for the right-of-use assets and interest  expense on the lease liabilities.

The implementation of AASB 16 has implications for a number of budget aggregates, in particular, net debt  and net financial worth due to the recognition of the new lease liabilities. To maintain consistency in the  measurement of the underlying cash balance, the principal payments on lease liabilities which are recognised  as cash flows from financing activities, have been included in the calculation following the implementation  of AASB 16.

For General Government Sector financial reporting, the implementation of AASB 16 has been reflected in  the 2019-20 MYEFO estimates and in the Australian Government General Government Sector Monthly  Financial Statements from the December 2019 reporting period.

Taxation revenue  While total tax collections are known with certainty at the end of each month, the distribution across the  relevant heads of revenue cannot be finalised until all business activity statements are received and processed.  The outcomes for some revenue items provided in this statement are therefore estimates, in accordance with  the best judgement of the Commissioner of Taxation, and subject to revision. The taxation revenue items not  affected are: petroleum resource rent tax, excise duty, customs duty, other taxes and individuals refunds.

Style conventions  Figures in tables and generally in the text have been rounded. Discrepancies in tables between totals and  sums of components are due to rounding.

International Monetary Fund Special Data Dissemination Standards  The Government is committed to releasing the monthly financial statements in a timely fashion and will  endeavour to do so in accordance with International Monetary Fund (IMF) Special Data Dissemination  Standards (SDDS). Under these standards the timeframe for releasing the monthly financial statements is by  the end of the following month. Australia applies a special flexibility option which allows it to publish late  the last and first month of a financial year.

In accordance with the IMF SDDS, the approximate date of release of the data on debt guaranteed by the  Australian Government (central government), is given on the IMF’s Data Dissemination Advance Release  Calendar http://dsbb.imf.org. Monthly and quarterly data on debt guaranteed by the Australian Government  (central government) that meet the coverage and timeliness requirements of the SDDS are published on the  Australian Office of Financial Management website at https://www.aofm.gov.au/data-hub.
