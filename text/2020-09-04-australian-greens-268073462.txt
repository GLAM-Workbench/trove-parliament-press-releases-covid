Greens will move a second reader amendment to Jobkeeper bill calling  for Jobseeker to be kept above the poverty line

The Greens have circulated a second reading amendment in the Senate to the  Governmentâ€™s Coronavirus Economic Response Package (Jobkeeper  Payments) Amendment Bill 2020 seeking the support of the Senate to continue  the current rate of the $550 coronavirus supplement.

It is untenable to cut the Jobseeker payment by $300 in September, taking it  below the poverty line.

There are 1.8 million people on Jobseeker and Youth Allowance and we are  looking at a 13% effective unemployment rate by Christmas.

There is very clear evidence that the coronavirus supplement has kept 2.2  million Australians out of poverty and almost eliminated it amongst Jobseeker  recipients, with poverty rates down from pre-pandemic levels of 67% amongst  recipients to less than 7% now.

The cruelty of low income support rates has been laid bare by this pandemic.

What kind of Government wants to go back to an income support system that  condemns people to poverty?

I ask the Senate to show their support for our community and support the  Greens amendments calling on the Government to keep the Jobseeker above  the poverty line.

Second reading amendment to be moved by Senator Siewert on behalf of the  Australian Greens reads:

(a) end its plans to reduce the coronavirus supplement by $300 a fortnight  which will cause millions of Australians to fall below the poverty line;  (b) continue to provide the current $550 coronavirus supplement throughout the  pandemic to ensure unemployed Australians receive adequate support;  (c) commit to a permanent and adequate increase to Jobseeker Payment that  allows unemployed Australians to live above the poverty line.
