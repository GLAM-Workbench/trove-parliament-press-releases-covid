MEDIA RELEASE  CASHLESS DEBIT CARD

THOUSANDS MORE TO BE CONDEMNED TO CASHLESS DEBIT

CARD DESPITE FAILURE OF GOVERNMENT TO PROVE IT WORKS

The Greens have strongly condemned the lifting of the temporary pause on

new income support recipients going on to the Cashless Debit Card program,

put in place in response to COVID-19.

"The Government has spent billions pushing this punitive scheme, and millions

on flawed evaluations trying to prove that the card works and to justify their

punitive approach.

"They have been unable to provide ANY compelling evidence that the card has

had a positive outcome or achieved any of its supposed aims.

"From April 1, not only will millions be condemned to poverty, those in the so- called trial sites who are new to income support will be put on income

management.

"Managing money is not the problem, it’s the $44 a day people are trying to

survive on!

"The Government say they will implement a “staggered approach” to ensure

income support recipients who are new to the Cashless Debit Card program

can get the support they need during their transition.



"I’m frankly staggered they are even trying this on, this card makes life harder

for people.

"While we are having a national conversation about violence against women, I

am deeply concerned that this card may keep people in violent situations and

the low rate of income supports severely limits the options for women and

children leaving violent homes.

"This Government is flogging a dead horse. Give it up. The card doesn’t work.

This cruel social experiment needs to end."
