AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE FOR NSW  STORMS AND FLOODS

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australian Government support payments activated for NSW storms and floods.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Quickest and easiest way to claim is to call 180 22 66.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Phone line is open now, eligible recipients can claim today.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Check eligibility at www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/disaster   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Services Australia Mobile Service Centre and Mobile Service Teams mobilised to provide  assistance when safe.

The Australian Government has activated the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment  (AGDRP) and Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA) to support those heavily affected by the storms  and flooding in New South Wales.

Support through the AGDRP and DRA is now available in the local government areas of Armidale,  Bellingen, Central Coast, Cessnock City, Clarence Valley, Coffs Harbour, Dungog, Hawkesbury,  Kempsey, Lake Macquarie, Maitland City, Mid-Coast, Nambucca Valley, Newcastle City, Port  Macquarie-Hastings, Penrith, Port Stephens and Tenterfield.

More local government areas will be added following further assessments in consultation with the  NSW Government.

The Australian Government Crisis Committee and Australian Government Disaster Recovery  Committee are also meeting today to ensure that the Commonwealth can be prepared for any  further assistance that may be required by New South Wales.

Minister for Emergency Management, David Littleproud, said the package provides assistance to  those who had suffered a significant loss, including a severely damaged or destroyed home,  serious injury or who have lost a family member.

‘Our first concern is for the safety and needs of those directly affected, particularly those whose  homes have been inundated by floodwaters,’ Minister Littleproud said.

‘It is clear that additional Australian Government assistance is needed to support the community to  recover from this extraordinary weather event.

‘By making these payments available to the affected residents, the Australian Government will  ensure that those who have lost or sustained damage to their homes or lost their livelihoods as a  result of the floods will have the additional assistance they need.

‘The AGDRP provides a one-off, non-means tested payment of $1,000 for eligible adults and $400  for eligible children, who have been seriously injured, lost their homes or whose homes have been  directly damaged, or the immediate family members of a person who has lost their life, as a direct  result of the storms and floods.

‘The DRA provides a short-term income support payment to assist individuals whose income has  been affected as a direct result of the storms and floods.’

People eligible for DRA can access income assistance for up to 13 weeks, equivalent to the  maximum rate of JobSeeker Payment or Youth Allowance.

Equivalent financial assistance will also be available to eligible New Zealand citizens   (‘non-protected’ Special Category Visa, subclass 444 holders) affected by the storms and floods.

Minister for Government Services, Stuart Robert, said Services Australia had been on standby to  assist in disaster affected areas.

‘Services Australia Disaster Assistance phone lines are open now—the fastest and easiest way to  claim disaster assistance is over the phone by calling 180 22 66,’ Minister Robert said.

‘Services Australia are also activating additional response measures through its Mobile Service  Centres and Mobile Services Teams, and stand ready to provide on the ground assistance when  safe to do so.

‘There may be some disruption at Services Australia service centres in affected areas over coming  days. We ask that people who use these services to access them via online or over the phone  where possible. I urge people to heed local emergency services warnings and do not travel unless  safe to do so.’

Services Australia Disaster Assistance phone lines are open from 8am to 8pm local time, seven  days a week. For more information on support available, visit servicesaustralia.gov.au/disaster.

The Morrison Government will also lift mutual obligation requirements for job seekers in the Local  Government Areas impacted by the NSW floods and storms from Friday 19 March until Tuesday 6  April 2021.

No job seeker in the affected areas will face payment suspension or financial penalties for failing to  meet their mutual obligation requirements such as not being able to attend appointments or  activities.

More information about mutual obligations requirements can be found at www.dese.gov.au/covid-19/job-seekers
