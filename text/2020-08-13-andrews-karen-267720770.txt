BUILDING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BONDS WITH THE  UNITED STATES

13 August 2020

Australia and the United States have strengthened their long and productive  collaborative history with a senior-level dialogue on science and frontier  technologies.

Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Karen Andrews, who virtually met with  White House officials yesterday, said the two nations were committed to increasing  cooperation in science and technology.

“There are enormous opportunities for Australia and the US to work together on key  issues such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, oceans exploration and  mapping, and research integrity,” Minister Andrews said.

“Science and technology are of major economic and security importance, especially  in the COVID-19 recovery, and both nations will benefit through collaborating on  policies that promote innovation and competitiveness.

“Both countries have identified opportunities to share resources and expertise,  including through the newly established Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence.

“We’re also keen to establish a framework for ongoing collaboration with the US and  other likeminded nations to advance our common values and interests in  international forums.”

The dialogue is an outcome of Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s state visit to the US  last year, where he and President Donald Trump agreed to hold a joint senior-level  dialogue on advancing frontier technologies.

White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Director Kelvin Droegemeier  and US Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios led the American delegation.
