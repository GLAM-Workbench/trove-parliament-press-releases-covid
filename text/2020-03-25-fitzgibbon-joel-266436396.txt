RENT THE BIGGEST ISSUE FOR SMALL BUSINESS

Having surveyed dozens of local small businesses, it is clear that paying the rent is  the biggest concern for Coronavirus-hit small business men and women.

“It’s pretty hard to pay the landlord when you have no customers and no sales”, Mr  Fitzgibbon said.

“Many small businesses have already closed due to Government declaration and  many more will close if we don’t find a way of providing rent relief.  Many landlords  are voluntarily providing relief but others will not be in a position to do so.

“Small business operators have been provided with cash flow assistance through the  tax withholdings system but more assistance will be needed to meet overheads  including rent.

“The clock is ticking and many more small businesses will be closing their doors and  many more employees will lose their jobs if more assistance is not forthcoming  soon,” Mr Fitzgibbon said.
