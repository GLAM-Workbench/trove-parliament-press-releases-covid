LABOR’S NEW TEST ON RESOURCES SECTOR

Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia says Anthony Albanese’s frontbench  reshuffle provides a new test for Labor to offer unequivocal support for the resources sector  and the hundreds of thousands of Australians it employs.

Minister Pitt said the resources portfolio has been a vexed issue for Labor and this reshuffle  will provide a real test for Madeline King.

“Labor has a chance to emphatically show its support for the whole resources sector,  including coal mining, or will this simply be a reshuffle of portfolio chairs with the same  mixed messages from Labor to the men and women employed in the industry,” Minister Pitt  said.

“The resources industry has steered the Australian economy through the COVID recession,  directly employing around 240 thousand Australians and over a million more indirectly.

“Latest trade figures indicate resources exports in the twelve months to December were  valued at $272 billion, which included a 26 per cent increase in coal exports last month to  $3.7 billion,” Minister Pitt said.

“The question now is whether Madeline King will continue the Labor strategy of delivering  one message in Mackay and another in Melbourne when it comes to the resources industry.

“Australians have seen through Labor’s doublespeak on resources and will do again unless  Madeline King demonstrates full commitment to the mining industry and all those who  work in it.”
