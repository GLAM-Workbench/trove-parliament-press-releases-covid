AUSTRALIA SHOULD FOLLOW UK LEAD WITH A KINDNESS ARMY FOR

OLDER AUSTRALIANS



The Morrison Government should follow the UK’s lead and invite all Australians

to assist in supporting vulnerable members of the community who are at risk of

loneliness or social isolation.



Overnight it was reported over 400,000 people had responded to the UK’s call

for an army of volunteers to assist health services with the impact of COVID-19.



The same thing could be done in Australia to assist vulnerable members of our

community, including helping older Australians who are already at risk of

loneliness and social isolation.



Last week Labor wrote to the Government calling for a significant expansion of

Commonwealth programs that exist to address the loneliness and social

isolation of vulnerable older Australians.



One easy solution is to scale up the Community Visitors Scheme - which

already helps connect volunteers with visits to older Australians at risk of



loneliness and social isolation.



Instead of physical visits this scheme could be resourced to connect volunteers

to contact isolated older Australians by phone or video call.



Labor has also called for more dedicated resources for frontline mental health

organisations that deal with the issue of loneliness amongst older Australians.



While the Federal Government has a key role to play, the responsibility to look

after older Australians at this time is one we all share.



We should all be prepared to reach out to older Australians at this time -

whether that is calling a parent or grandparent, checking in with a neighbour or

offering to do a shop for someone in isolation.
