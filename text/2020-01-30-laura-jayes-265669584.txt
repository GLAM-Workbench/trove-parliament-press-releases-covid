LAURA JAYES:

The Government is looking at evacuating some 600 Australians out of the Wuhan province  which is the epicentre of the Coronavirus. Joining me now is the Home Affairs Minister Peter  Dutton. Thank you for your time Minister.

PETER DUTTON:



Thanks Laura.

LAURA JAYES:

How will this evacuation work?

PETER DUTTON:



Well Laura, obviously we're reliant on our advice from the Chinese authorities so we're  working through that process now. But the proposal that the Government's accepted is that  there would be a charter flight from Wuhan province into Australia. We would isolate those  people on Christmas Island in the facilities that we have there. So for a period of 14 days, or  up to 14 days on the medical advice, and then people can be repatriated back to their  homes.

So we want to make sure that we can protect Australians who are stuck in what is a very  difficult situation and we want to make sure that we can keep Australians safe at home -  that is we don't inadvertently want people wandering the streets who have come back that  may be infected and therefore spread the virus.

So I think it's a balanced, measured response and I think most people would see it for that.

LAURA JAYES:

How long are negotiations with the Chinese likely to take? Are we talking 24 hours? A  number of days? And is there - why is there a holdup?

PETER DUTTON:



I would have thought it happens fairly quickly and those conversations already are  underway obviously with DFAT. So we'll let that process run.

We're not sure how many people will take up the offer to return home. Other countries  including the United States, Korea, Japan, for example, have uplifted some of their people. I  think in the case of the Americans, they've just pulled out their consular staff. They had  quite a number within the province there and they took a similar decision to isolate people I  think in Anchorage before they're repatriated back into the American community.

So it's not easy to find a facility. There's been some criticism this morning about Christmas  Island, but I think Christmas Island is a very different facility then what people imagine in  their minds from ten years or so ago.

I can't clear out a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne to isolate people and some people will  take a decision to stay where they are because perhaps they've been there for a long period  of time. Even if they are Australian citizens, they'll have family there.

We want to make sure that we can help children in particular and vulnerable adults  otherwise, but we'll work through the cases and we'll do what we can to try to provide  assistance to those people.

LAURA JAYES:

So is there around 600 people in Wuhan that you believe you can offer help, but you don't  know how many might take up that offer? Have you started that process?

PETER DUTTON:



DFAT's obviously responsible for that process and they've had a process where people can  register so their numbers will be based on that. They obviously work with my Department,  Border Force as well, to make sure that they can cross match all of that travel information.

The Prime Minister, as you said yesterday, has issued the edict that we want the last people  in to be the first out. So people, as I say, will make a decision. Some people are desperate to  get out, others believe that they are best to ride it out there and they've got family  members out there that they want to stay and be with and you can understand that.

So DFAT is very good at this operation, they've done it many times before and they'll work  through the individual cases, prioritise those that we can uplift and with the Chinese  authority's approval, we'll do that as quickly as possible.

LAURA JAYES:

You alluded to the criticism of Christmas Island overnight. How long will people spend  there? You say up to 14 days. What are the precautions you put in place? Who will be  overseeing that medical advice?

PETER DUTTON:



So there's an operation underway between Australian Border Force, Defence, obviously  DFAT and other government agencies as well. I'm going to chair a meeting shortly after this  just to get an idea of the work that's been undertaken overnight. So we'll work with DFAT,  but Defence in particular because they can provide services such as catering in a very quick  fashion for us. It may mean that they need to do some airlifts for us.

We're talking about a completely isolated area from the broader Christmas Island  community. We won’t facilitate people into the medical centre or the services that are  offered to Christmas Island residents.

So we have medical facilities within the Christmas Island Border Force facility. So I think  we're well placed and I think we rely on the best agencies really that we have in  Government to deliver these services. And I think Border Force will step up, as the Army  will, and we'll make sure that people are there for a short period of time. But ultimately, we  rely on the medical advice in particular that of the Chief Medical Officer and the advice  seems to be up to 14 days, you'll get an idea as to whether or not people are presenting  with symptoms and we can give them a clearance and send them back to their place of  residence.

LAURA JAYES:

There are already dozens of Australians that have returned home from Wuhan in recent  weeks and many are quarantining themselves in their own homes. Do you accept that we  might be looking at a bit of a fragmented approach this morning given that? And there is a  bit of criticism that Christmas Island has looked like overkill, given those two comparisons.

PETER DUTTON:



Well as I say, in the case of the Americans now they've sent people to Anchorage, so other  countries will isolate their people before they return. But Laura, I just don't have an empty

hospital sitting around, I can't move people out of Royal Brisbane Hospital or a section of  that. We have a facility purpose made for this type of event on Christmas Island. We want to  make sure that Australians are safe, that there's not a spread of the disease, of the virus,  and we've worked very closely with the Chief Medical Officer and we've looked at different  facilities and this, in our judgement, is the best.

LAURA JAYES:

But I guess the question is why can't they quarantine themselves in their own homes like  many Chinese business people are already doing so?

PETER DUTTON:



Well we’ve got over 10,000 people arriving a day from parts of China so need to realistic  about how we manage this issue. People can hub through Singapore or Hong Kong, or have  gone from Wuhan to the United States and come from the United States, or hub through  Dubai if they've been to Europe, for example, so there's only so much that we can do. But  people need to follow the medical advice and I think it's sensible that people would self-isolate if they believe that there's a concern.

There's very clear advice from the Chief Medical Officer to call ahead to either an  emergency department or to your GP. We're worried about presentations at pharmacists  for example.

But as the WHO and others have pointed out, Australia is one of the - probably the top two  in the world in terms of our preparedness for a crisis like this. We're making sure that we're  working with the airlines, we're heeding the medical advice and there are well-practised  measures that have been put into place now and I think people should be reassured by that.

LAURA JAYES:

Qantas says it can't actually land a 747 safely on Christmas Island. Is that a bit of a flaw in  your plan?

PETER DUTTON:



No it's not. So we can land an A330. It'll depend on the number of people that we have  ultimately.

LAURA JAYES:

Right.

PETER DUTTON:

And there's also contingency for people to land - to be transferred to a military aircraft and  then to head to Christmas Island so that's all been rehearsed - the Army and Border Force  have gone through all of that detail.

LAURA JAYES:

Okay. British Airways stopped all flights to China yesterday. Would you be hoping that  Qantas looks to do the same?

PETER DUTTON:



Qantas have said overnight that they will look at the advice out of the WHO. They'll look at  what their partners are doing and they'll make a judgement themselves. So that's a decision  for Qantas to make and obviously will rely on the advice ultimately of the Chief Medical  Officer of Australia, the advice of the National Security Committee otherwise and we've  been meeting regularly. The Prime Minister, I think, has taken the right decisions and it's all  based on the expert advice. We've got the National Crisis Coordination Committee that's  meeting each day and they collate all of that information, we're briefed on it and we make  the decisions accordingly.

LAURA JAYES:

Okay. It is quite the operation it seems.

Finally, before we let you go, Bridget McKenzie. She's certainly sucking a bit of oxygen out of  the Government the moment. You strongly backed her twice last week, are you willing to do  the same this week?

PETER DUTTON:



Yes I am. And as the Prime Minister has pointed out, there's a process now that's in place.  So he's waiting on that advice back from the Secretary of the Department of the Prime  Minister and Cabinet. Obviously he's looked very closely at the recommendations made by  the Auditor-General and I think that's the right process. I think we should, again, leave some  of the emotion to one side, look at the facts and make a decision on that basis.

LAURA JAYES:

Minister Dutton, thanks so much for your time.

PETER DUTTON:



Thanks very much Laura.
