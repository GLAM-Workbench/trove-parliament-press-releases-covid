Agriculture jobs essential to Australia

Agriculture Minister David Littleproud says Australia’s food production and supply chain  will not be affected by coronavirus shutdowns.

“The Commonwealth is guaranteeing food production and supply as we deal with the  virus’s spread,” Minister Littleproud said.

“I am in constant dialogue with farming groups, the States, supermarkets and my  department to make sure there’s food on the table for all Australians.

“As far as the Commonwealth is concerned, food production and supply is an essential  service.

“Feeding our nation is an essential service.

“That means State-imposed border shutdowns will not affect agricultural supply chains.

“The trucks carrying food and produce will get through to the shops.

“Feed, hay, fertilizer and other agriculture products will continue being delivered to farms.

“We’ve got plenty of supply and the freight lanes across the country are being kept clear.

“Australians can be assured that their farmers will be able to keep producing the great food  they’re renowned for the world over.

“This food will arrive fresh and on time at their local supermarket the same as it’s always  done.

“Maintaining food production, access to workers, agricultural supply lines, transportation  and logistics is absolutely critical and will not be affected by any of the measures aimed at  curbing the virus’s spread.”
