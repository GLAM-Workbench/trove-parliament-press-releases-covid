NATALIE BARR:



Joining us now is Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. Morning to you Minister.

PETER DUTTON:



Morning Nat.

NATALIE BARR:



With the death toll rising and the virus still spreading, how can you ensure Australians will  be safe?

PETER DUTTON:



Well Nat, we know that there are almost 15,000 people now that are affected by this virus,  over 300 deaths and we want to make sure that we isolate people coming from Wuhan and  obviously we've put in place a lot of logistical support, we've worked closely with Defence  and Border Force. They'll receive those people and people will be in quarantine for up to 14  days until they can get clearance from doctors and once that happens, people can then  return back to their homes.

DAVID KOCH:

Lots of Aussies in other parts of China, finding it hard to get home. With our strict travel  bans now in place, what are their options to get home?

PETER DUTTON:



So Kochie, some people are already on flights and obviously Qantas has announced they're  going to cancel flights after the 9th of February. We've seen Australian citizens take the  decision to come home already and other people that have made decisions for their own  reasons to stay. They'll have business, they'll have family reasons as to why they want to  stay and people will make those individual decisions.

But we've been very clear to Australians - now the travel warning has been raised to the  point where we're saying to people they should not travel to China - and we're reviewing  that again in a fortnight. We're making sure that we can get on top of any developments  there and ultimately relying on the medical advice here.

NATALIE BARR:



Minister, just over a week ago you were allowing people to land directly into this country  directly from Wuhan. Haven't you acted too late on this?

PETER DUTTON:



No, we've acted in accord with the advice that we've received. So the National Security  Committee has met regularly, we've made a decision in relation to the Hubei province,  we've made a decision in relation to mainland China and we have done that on the advice,  not only of the Chief Medical Officer of Australia, but also the Chief Medical Officers from  the states and territories. So they meet together, they look at all the best evidence from the  World Health Organization. We overlay that with the intelligence and with the advice that  we have otherwise. We have acted very quickly.

Obviously a number of airlines have decided to cancel flights. People of their own accord  have decided to turn around knowing that Australia has put in place this overlay. So I think  we've done everything humanly possible to keep Australians safe here and to make sure  that we provide support to those that are stuck in some of these areas.

DAVID KOCH:

Just quickly, China is our biggest customer, is this going push us into a recession?

PETER DUTTON:



Well Kochie, it's a good question. Obviously we're already worried, for example, around the  tourism industry and there's a lot of support that the Government's giving to try and  promote the idea that if you're thinking about a holiday, please think about it domestically,

supporting particularly regional centres that have been affected by the bushfires and this  will be an additional overlay. So it's the reason why managing the Budget well and  effectively and trying to have money in the bank for a rainy day is important andâ€¦

DAVID KOCH:

...so recession, yes or no?

PETER DUTTON:



Sorry mate?

DAVID KOCH:

A recession, yes or no?

PETER DUTTON:



No, I think the economy is resilient enough and I think we need to make sure, as I say, that  we support Australian business and that's really the cry for consumers at the moment.

DAVID KOCH:

Fingers crossed. Thank you for joining us. Appreciate it.
