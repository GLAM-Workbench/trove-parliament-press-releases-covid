Embargoed until 12.01am - 31 August 2020

The Na



tional Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC) has today released its first research  report on the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, which provides a snapshot of key trends and insights  for the Scheme’s first six months of operation.

Key insights from the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme Trends & Insights report, which covers the six  months to 30 June, include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ One in eight of all first home buyers accessed the Scheme, based on available settlement data. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Key



workers accounted for more than 1,800 (one in six) first home buyers using the Scheme, with teachers the largest group (37 per cent of the key worker cohort), followed by nurses (25 per cent). Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Major cities attracted 62.3 per cent of buyers under the Scheme while 37.7 per cent

purchased in regional areas. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ More than half of the homes purchased in capital cities were between 15 and 30 kilometres from the CBD, with couple applicants typically buying further away from the CBD than singles. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ First home buyers moved an average of 7.6 kilometres from their existing residence.

Victorian purchasers moved the greatest distance at 10.4 kilometres from their existing home. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Almost 70 per cent of buyers using the Scheme purchased a detached house, with 25 per cent buying an apartment and 5 per cent purchasing a townhouse. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The median purchase price for houses was $385,000 compared with $475,000 for

a



partments (most apartments purchased were in capital cities). Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Half of Scheme guarantees were issued to single buyers with taxable incomes of $60,000 to $80,000. Couples were concentrated in the $90,000 to $125,000 earnings bracket. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Of the 10,000 places released for the six months to 30 June, more than half of the homes

had settled (54.7 per cent). Another 13.4 per cent of Scheme applicants had signed contracts to purchase a home, and 31.9 per cent had been pre-approved and were looking to buy. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Based on NHFIC’s analysis, the Scheme enabled first home buyers without alternative f



inancial means to bring forward their purchase by an average of four years.

N



HFIC CEO Nathan Dal Bon said analysis of the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme’s first six months of  operation found the Scheme had broad appeal.

“Demand for the Scheme in the six months to 30 June continued despite the onset of the COVID-19  pandemic,” Mr Dal Bon said. “First time buyers across age and income spectrums around the country  accessed the Scheme, and we saw strong interest from buyers in outer metropolitan and regional  areas.”

Mr Dal Bon noted that the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme Trends & Insights report is part of a series  of short targeted reports from NHFIC’s new research unit. NHFIC intends to provide an annual update  on the operation of the Scheme following the end of each financial year.

This new report follows NHFIC’s research publication Building Jobs: How Residential Construction  Drives the Economy, which was released in late June.

The report is available on the NHFIC website www.nhfic.gov.au.

About the First Home Loan  Deposit Scheme

The First Home Loan Deposit Scheme  is an Australian Government initiative  to support eligible fi rst home buyers  pur

chase their first home sooner.   Under the Scheme, eligible first home  buyers can purchase a home with a  deposit of as little as 5 per cent.



This

is because NHFIC guarantees a  Scheme lender up to 15 percent of the  value of the property financed by an  eligible first home buyer’s home loan.

10,000 Scheme places were released  to participating lenders from 1 January  2020. An additional 10,000 Scheme  places were released from 1 July for  the 2020-21 financial year.

Buyer



s must satisfy certain eligibility  requirements, including that they have  a taxable income under $125,000 if  they are a single applicant ($200,000  for a couple), and that the intended

purchased property is subject to  the property price caps set by the  Australian Government, which differ  across Australia.

In practice, the Scheme operates in  three main stages. First, the lender  reserves a guarantee for the first  home buyer and the loan is pre-approved, which allows the buyer  to make their purchase or plan their  build. Second, if the first home buyer  successfully purchases a property  or enters a building contract, the  guarantee is issued. In the final  stage, the guarantee is activated  when settlement of the property has  been confirmed.

Report embargoed until 31/8/20

The Scheme is limited to 10,000  guarantees per financial year.

This report provides the first  detailed snapshot of the FHLDS for  the fi rst six months of its operation,  fr

om 1 January 2020 to 30 June  2020. As at 30 June 2020, 10,000  Scheme places had been allocated.  Of these, 6,814 participants had  either signed a contract or settled  on their home, while the remaining  3,186 were at the loan pre-approval stage and still looking for  a property.

The Scheme has experienced  strong demand and supported a  broad cross-section of Australians  purchasing their first home. This  includes people of all ages across  metro and r



egional areas around

Australia, and those who have  moderate taxable incomes. The  Scheme is also supporting key  workers, such as teachers and  nurses, to access the housing  market sooner.

1. OVERVIEW

Many Australians aspir



e to own

their own home. Home ownership  provides security of tenure. It is  also an important vehicle for wealth  accumulation, and the largest asset  most Australians hold.

However, buying a home has  become more challenging for some.  For example, in the early 1990s, it  took an average household around  six years to save a 20 per cent  deposit to buy a typical dwelling.  More recently, it takes around nine  to 10 years.1

Many people can afford to service  a mortgage once they have passed  the initial hurdle of saving a  deposit.2

On 1 January 2020, the Australian  Government’s First Home Loan  Deposit Scheme (FHLDS  or the Scheme) commenced. The  Scheme provides a guarantee that,  subject to eligibility and lender  credit criteria, first home buyers can  purchase a home with a deposit of  as little as 5 per cent of the value of  the property.

2. KEY INSIGHTS The Scheme has helped homeowners  purchase their first property, acting as  a support mechanism for the first home  buyer market. It has assisted first home  buyers across the income, age and  demographic spectrum.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Scheme supported one in eight of all first home buyers who purchased a home in Australia between March and June 2020 (the first four months for which comparable settlement data was available).3

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Guarantees for single applicants were concentrated in the 25-to-34 age range and in moderate income brackets - those earning $60,000 to $80,000 - compared to the $125,000 eligibility income threshold under the Scheme.4

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Guarantees for couples were also most prominent in the 25-to-34 age range, but at higher income levels - the $90,000 to $125,000 income bracket - compared to the $200,000 income threshold for couples.5

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Although people accessing the Scheme were typically younger, more than 10 per cent were aged over 40.

Australian Bureau of Statistics, Lending Indicators, June 2020, cat. no. 5601.0. The ABS notes that there were uneven COVID-19 effects  on reported housing loan commitments. A full statement on the impact can be found on the ABS website. Given the Scheme was  implemented on 1 January 2020, and the associated time lag between pre-approval and settlement of a property, the number of properties  settled under the FHLDS could only be accurately benchmarked against the wider first home buyer market over the period stated.

Income data captured under the Scheme is for the 2018-19 financial year. First home buyers’ financial circumstances may have changed  between 30 June 2019 and when the guarantee was issued.

The Scheme has broad geographical  reach across all states and territories,  with regional Australia well represented.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The FHLDS has supported first home buyers across all states and territories: 62.3 per cent of buyers purchased in major cities and 37.7 per cent purchased in regional areas. This is broadly in line with the general population distribution, with 67.7 per cent living in major cities and 32.3 per cent in regional areas.6

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The geographic distribution of guarantees in states and territories under the Scheme is largely in line with the resident population share7, except in Western Australia and South Australia. Demand in these states, which have longstanding first home buyer support initiatives, was lower.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Demand for the Scheme by postcode was highest in the Toowoomba area, in regional Queensland, with 70 loans guaranteed in that area. Demand was also strong across South Western Sydney (Campbelltown area) and the outer suburbs of Melbourne (Craigieburn and Frankston).

Buyers supported by the Scheme  preferred detached houses over  apartments or townhouses.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Almost 70 per cent of all buyers supported by the Scheme purchased a house. By comparison, 25 per cent purchased an apartment and the remaining 5 per cent purchased a townhouse.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Four out of five apartment purchases under the Scheme were in major cities, while house purchases were more evenly spread across major cities and regional areas.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Of the 6,814 applicants who settled on their property or were issued a guarantee, almost 10 per cent purchased a newly constructed dwelling, which included 381 who purchased land separately and had a contract to build; 142 purchased a house and land package; and 105 purchased off-the-plan.

Buyers were prepared to move some  distance away from their existing  residence to buy their first home, with  purchases concentrated in outer city  areas.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ First home buyers under the Scheme moved an average of 7.6 kilometres from their prior residential address. Victorian purchasers using the Scheme moved the largest distance (an average of 10.4 kilometres) from their previous home.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Nearly two-thirds of applicants buying in the Greater Sydney region bought more than 30 kilometres from the CBD, while that figure is just under half for Greater Melbourne. For other cities, the majority of people purchased within 30 kilometres of the CBD.

Demand for the Scheme was strong,  with early take-up of available Scheme  places.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Almost 60 per cent of all Scheme places that received a Commonwealth guarantee had been taken up within the first two months of the Scheme’s operation.

The Scheme has supported many key  workers buying their first home.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ More than one in six (1,804) first home buyers accessing the Scheme are key workers.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Teachers had the highest representation, with 665 new home owners under the Scheme (37 per cent of the entire key worker cohort). This was followed by nurses (25 per cent); defence force personnel, firefighters and police (13 per cent); and childcare workers (10 per cent).

The Scheme has supported first home  buyers and allowed them to bring  forward their home purchase.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If purchasers under the Scheme did not have alternative financial means and had to save the entire 20 per cent deposit, they would have had to delay their first home purchase by an average of four years.8

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Scheme has enabled buyers to bring forward their purchase by up to almost five years in NSW.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ As at 30 June 2020, the Commonwealth Government had guaranteed almost $400 million in deposit shortfalls for first home buyers across Australia.

8. The savings rate of 18.6 per cent applied across the cohort was derived from Australian Bureau of Statistics, Household Expenditure Surv  ey, Australia: Summary of Results, 2015-16, cat. no. 6530.0. The savings rate is based on the third

income quintile. Figures are only indicativ



e as household savings rates will differ according to individual circumstances.

The Scheme has helped homeowners  from across the income, age and  demographic spectrum purchase their  first property.

One in eight of all first home buyers accessed  the housing market under the FHLDS.9

The Scheme has helped first home buyers  enter the housing market in the first six months  of 2020, including during the COVID-19  pandemic.

Comparable settlement data recorded between  March and June 2020 showed the Scheme  supported one in eight of all first home buyers  who purchased a home during this period.10 In  Queensland and NSW, one in six of all first  home buyers accessed the Scheme over the  same period.

8 First Home Loan Deposit Scheme

More than half of all Scheme applicants have  settled or are living in their first home.

Over the first six months of 2020, 10,000  Scheme places were filled. Of those, 54.7 per  cent had settled, another 13.4 per cent had  been issued a guarantee and were awaiting  settlement, and 31.9 per cent had pre-approval and are still looking to purchase.

9 First Home Loan Deposit Scheme

The Scheme is supporting families  and individuals accessing the housing  market across the age and income  spectrum.

Half of all guarantees were issued to single  applicants in moderate income brackets -  earning $60,000 to $80,000 - which is 52 per  cent below the $125,000 eligibility income  threshold. The median property price for single  applicants was $370,000. Guarantees issued  to couples were concentrated in the higher  income brackets - between $90,000 and  $125,000 - with a higher median property  purchase price of $425,000.12

The distribution of buyers by age and  household taxable income shows that 4,533  applicants were aged 25 to 34.15 More than  10 per cent of all first home buyers were over  the age of 40.16  A total of 2,345 applicants  were earning between $90,000 and $125,000  per annum. Another 1,693 applicants were  earning between $60,000 and $80,000 per  annum, and 845 applicants were earning  between $125,000 and $150,000.17

Income data captured under the Scheme is for the 2018-19 financial year. First home buyers’ financial circumstances  may have changed between 30 June 2019 and when the guarantee was issued.

The distribution by age is based on individual buyers, rather than Scheme places. Those who submitted their Scheme  application as a couple have been treated as two separate individuals for this analysis.

Demand for the Scheme was strong,  with the early take up of available  Scheme places offered by major banks.

Within the first two months of the Scheme’s  operation, almos  t 60 per cent of all Scheme

places that received a Commonwealth  guarantee had been taken up. The rate at  which Scheme places were taken up was  heavily dependent on lender quotas, with  major bank quotas fully taken up by the first  week of February and non-major bank quotas  taken up towards the end of May 2020.20

Over the first six months of the Scheme’s  operation, NHFIC r  esponded to over 2,800

phone calls and over 3,000 emails - the  bulk of which were in relation to the FHLDS.  Similarly, of the 678,858 visits to the NHFIC  website, the vast majority were users seeking  information about the Scheme.

Scheme places became available again when  potential first home buyers withdrew their  application for r

easons such as choosing not

to proceed with their home purchase and/or  because their reservation expired.

Buyers under the Scheme had a  preference for detached houses relative  to apartments or townhouses.

Almost 70 per cent of buyers supported by  the Scheme purchased a house. By contrast,  more than 25 per cent bought an apartment  and the remaining 5 per cent purchased a  townhouse.

This trend was consistent across all states  and territories, with the exception of the  ACT. Almost two-thirds of buyers in the ACT  purchased an apartment, while 20 per cent  bought a house and the remainder purchased  a townhouse.

The median price for apartments purchased  under the Scheme was $475,000, which was  considerably higher than the median price of  $385,000 paid for houses. This was due to  most of the apartments being in capital cities  (83 per cent), while the houses were more  evenly spread across capital cities (54 per  cent) and regional areas (46 per cent).

Of the 6,814 applicants who settled on their  property or were issued a guarantee, almost  10 per cent purchased a newly constructed  dwelling, which included 381 who purchased  land separately and had a contract to build;  142 purchased a house and land package;  and 105 purchased off-the-plan.

The Scheme has broad geographical  reach across all states and territories.

Geographic distribution of places largely in  line with the resident population



.

First home buyers in all states and territories,  all major cities and many regional areas  have benefited from the FHLDS. Scheme  guarantees were mostly concentrated in NSW  (2,263), followed by Queensland (1,845)  and Victoria (1,617). Eight out of 10 loans  guaranteed under the Scheme were in these  three states.

The distribution of guarantees issued under  the Scheme across the states and territories  broadly aligns with the distribution of the  resident population, with the exception of  Western Australia and South Australia.21   This is likely attributed to the longstanding  Keystart and HomeStart low deposit home  loan initiatives currently active in Western  Australia and South Australia, respectively.

Purchases were concentrated in outer  city and metropolitan areas, but regional  areas were also well represented.

Buyers were prepared to move some  distance away from their existing residence  to purchase their first home.

Demand under the Scheme was heavily  concentrated in the outer suburban areas of  the major cities, particularly in Sydney and  Melbourne, and in



some satellite regional

centres.

First home buyers purchasing a home  under the Scheme moved an average of  7.6 kilometres from their existing residence.  Victorian purchasers using the Scheme moved  the greatest distance (10.4 kilometres),  followed by NSW (7.5 kilometres) and  Tasmania (7.5 kilometres)23.

More than half of all purchases under the Scheme in the Greater  Capital City Statistical Areas were between 15 kilometres and  30 kilometres from the nearest capital city CBD. Fewer than a  quarter were less than 15 kilometres from the CBD.25

Almost a third of all single applicants purchased within 15  kilometres of the nearest capital city CBD. However, only 13  per cent of all couple applicants purchased in this zone. Couple  applicants tended to purchase further away from the nearest  capital city CBD than single applicants.27

The Scheme has helped many key  workers buy their first home.

More than 1,800 key workers purchased their  first home with support from the FHLDS.

In the six months to June 2020, more than  1,800 teachers, nurses, emergency service  workers, defence force personnel and  childcare workers entered the housing market  with the support of the FHLDS. These key  workers accounted for just over 18 per cent  of all individuals accessing the Scheme during  the period. Of these key workers, 37 per  cent were teachers and 25 per cent were  nurses. Defence force personnel, firefighters  and police accounted for 13 per cent, while  childcare workers (10 per cent) also provided  strong demand.30

19 First Home Loan Deposit Scheme

The Scheme has helped first home buyers bring  for  ward their home purchase.

The main objective of the FHLDS is to help first home buyers  enter the housing market sooner.

Those without alternative financial means or access to the  Scheme would inevitably have to delay their home purchase.  For example, without the Scheme or alternative financial  means, a typical buyer in NSW would need to delay their  purchase by almost five years to save the entire 20 per cent  deposit.31

As at 30 June 2020, the Commonwealth Government had  guaranteed almost $400 million in deposit shortfalls for first  home buyer

s across Australia. NSW, Victoria and Queensland  accounted for 87.4 per cent of the total amount guaranteed.

Some guarantee recipients also received other government  support.

For every fi ve guarantees under the Scheme, two applicants  accessed an additional government incentive. Other  government incentives offered to first home buyers included  state and territory stamp duty concessions, the First Home  Owner Grant and the Commonwealth Government’s First  Home Super Saver Scheme. Around 40 per cent of buyers  under the FHLDS also received stamp duty concessions, while  14 per cent received a fi rst home owner state or territory grant

(noting that grant eligibility varies between jurisdictions; for  example, in NSW, these grants can only be applied to new  builds). Around 4 per cent also accessed the First Home Super  Saver Scheme.

The majority of buyers under the Scheme  (82.5 per cent) borrowed between 90 per  cent and 95 per cent of the property price.  Almost two-thirds borrowed between 94 per  cent and 95 per cent. The median debt-to-taxable-income ratio was 4.3, with purchasers  owing an average of $374,200. The ratio  deviates when broken down by region:  those purchasing in the Greater Capital City  Statistical Areas had a debt-to-taxable-income  ratio of 4.7, compared with purchases in  regional areas where the ratio was 3.9. The  average buyer in Victoria had the highest debt  ($456,000) and a debt-to-income ratio of 4.7.

21 First Home Loan Deposit Scheme

The average monthly mortgage repayment  for borrowers using the Scheme was $1,729  at the point of funding, which is equivalent  to 30 per cent of household disposable  income. This varies across the states and  territories. In NSW and Victoria, on average,  mortgage repayments are a third of household  disposable income. Unsurprisingly, buyers in  these states recorded the highest average  repayment-to-income ratio, due to higher  property purchase prices. In other states  and territories, mortgage repayments were  an average of 26 per cent of household  disposable income, except the Northern  Territory, where it was 20.6 per cent on  average.33

Buyers using the Scheme borrowed less than  those in the broader first home buyer market.  Between March and June 2020, buyers in  NSW using the FHLDS borrowed an average  of $430,000, compared with an average of  $520,000 for the broader NSW first home  buyer market.34

Mortgage minimum repayments were calculated using the point of  funding for the principal loan amount, interest rate and loan term.  Household income data captured under the Scheme was based on the  2018-19 financial year. First home buyers’ financial circumstances may  have changed between 30 June 2019 and when the guarantee was  issued.

Australian Bureau of Statistics, Lending Indicators, June 2020, cat. no.  5601.0. The ABS notes that there were uneven COVID-19 effects on  reported housing loan commitments. A full statement on the impact can  be found on the ABS website. Given the Scheme was implemented on 1  January 2020, and the associated time lag between pre-approval and  settlement of a property, the number of properties settled under

the FHLDS could only be accurately benchmark



ed against the wider

first home buyer market over the period stated.

Most guarantees were issued through mortgage  brokers.

Over the fir



st six months of the Scheme, and in line  with the broader mark  et almost half (46.1 per cent)  of all loans guar

anteed originated from a mortgage  broker. A further 38.4 per cent originated from  typical bank branches, and the remainder came from  other sources such as mobile and online lenders,  and by telephone. Excluding the month of January  (major banks only began offering loans originating  from mortgage brokers in February), the proportion  of mortgage-brokered loans under the Scheme  was 53.4 per cent. On a state and territory level,  Western Australia recorded the most (61.9 per  cent) guaranteed loans originating with a mortgage  broker.

CONCLUSION In the first six months of operation, 10,000 places were  allocated under the Australian Government’s First Home  Loan Deposit Scheme (FHLDS). Around one in eight of all  first home buyer purchases between March and June 2020  were backed by a Federal Government guarantee under the  Scheme. FHLDS has supported people across the age and  income spectrums, including many younger buyers, but also  some older cohorts purchasing their first home. The Scheme  has had broad geographical reach supporting first home  buyers across the country with strong interest from buyers in  outer metropolitan and regional areas. First time buyers have  been able to bring forward their home purchases in line with  the objectives of the Scheme.

FHLDS has now cemented itself as part of the first home  buyer support policy architecture. The second iteration of  guarantees was released from 1 July 2020 which will seek to  support another 10,000 aspiring first home buyers over the  current financial year. NHFIC will continue to monitor trends  and developments in the Scheme and will report annually on  these findings.
