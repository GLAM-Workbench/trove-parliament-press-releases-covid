Interview with Peter Stefanovic, First Edition, Sky News

Subjects: JobSeeker; August labour force figures; Budget 2020; State border restrictions

PETER STEFANOVIC:

Thanks for joining us this morning. Good to see you.

JOSH FRYDENBERG:

Good to see you.

PETER STEFANOVIC:

Is now the time to be getting tough on those on JobSeeker?

JOSH FRYDENBERG:

We are gradually introducing those mutual obligation responsibilities because the economy is opening up, people are getting back to work, restrictions are being eased outside of Victoria. Obviously Victoria is a different situation and they won’t be held to account in the same way. But, ultimately, what we want to do is get more people back to work. And yesterday’s job numbers were pretty encouraging. 111,000 new jobs created over the month of August. The unemployment rate falling from 7.5 per cent down to 6.8 per cent. These are good signs that our job plan is working. Now, a lot of people are still doing it very tough and we understand that, and that’s why the income support continues to be there. But ultimately, everything we do is motivated by the single goal of getting people back to work.

PETER STEFANOVIC:

There is still a lot more people on JobSeeker, though, than there are jobs available. So, how do those people find work if that work is not there?

JOSH FRYDENBERG:

Ultimately, they need to work with their job active and job service provider because by doing so, we can find a suitable job for them. Of course, if there is not a job there, then they can continue to try. Ultimately, what we need to do is create more jobs across the economy. That is what our JobMaker plan is all about. That’s why we need more flexibility in the labour market. That’s why we’ve investing in skills. That’s why we’re bringing forward infrastructure projects. That’s why we’re cutting red tape and that’s why we’re reconsidering the timing of our tax cuts because we are focused on getting more people back into work.

PETER STEFANOVIC:

You did have those good figures out yesterday. You’ve got to take your wins where you can get them, Treasurer. Are you expecting it to stay that way?

JOSH FRYDENBERG:

Look, the labour market is still very challenging and there is a big unknown there. That is called the coronavirus. Particularly in the state of Victoria which represents a quarter of the national economy, people are still subject to lockdown and curfew and businesses have been hit really hard. Now, I am hoping, the Prime Minister is hoping, that those restrictions can be eased as quickly as it is COVID-safe to do so. Once that happens, more businesses will re-open, more people will get back to work and that will be good news for the overall economy. But there is a lot of uncertainty out there in the economy, not just here in Australia, but globally. That’s a reflection of the nature of the virus and the fact that we’ve seen second waves, not just in Victoria but in other countries around the world.

PETER STEFANOVIC:

Just finally. Have you finished the Budget yet?

JOSH FRYDENBERG:

We’re pretty close. We’ve had our Expenditure Review Committee meetings that have been going for many months. It’s a gruelling task, but a critically important one. I was encouraged by the numbers yesterday but there is still a long way to go. The road will be pretty bumpy. So what you will see in the Budget on October 6 is the next stage in our JobMaker plan that is designed to get people back to work, to make the economy stronger and to build for a better future for all Australians.

PETER STEFANOVIC:

You are having some issues with the states, though, at the moment. Would you agree that the relationship is strained between the Prime Minister and the Queensland Premier?

JOSH FRYDENBERG:

Look, there are some challenges there and we’ve been outspoken on the border issue because closed borders cost jobs. As you know, the Prime Minister will be discussing today the lifting of the caps because we want to see more Australians come home. But we’ll call it out when it’s in the national interest to do so and that’s been our consistent position right through the coronavirus.

PETER STEFANOVIC:

Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, appreciate your time. Short and sweet. Thanks for joining us.

JOSH FRYDENBERG:

Thank you.
