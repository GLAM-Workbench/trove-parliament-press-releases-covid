GOVERNMENT MUST ASSESS FULL IMPACT OF BUSHFIRES ON NATIVE  SPECIES

The Morrison Government must comprehensively assess the full threats posed  to native species in the wake of the national bushfire crisis.

Following the bushfires, 28 additional species, including the koala and greater  glider, are to be assessed for potential threatened species listing by the  Threatened Species Scientific Committee. The Committee will make two  extraordinary additional assessments in coming months.

The fires devastated populations and habitats.

The Morrison Government must lift its game in ensuring that there are people in  the field, under COVID-safe arrangements, assessing the true extent of the  damage.

That is necessary to make sure future listings or uplistings are comprehensive.

The world is facing an extinction crisis and Australia leads the world in mammal  extinctions.

The Morrison Governmentâ€™s track record is on of making announcements and  failing to deliver on time, if at all. That has been true in bushfire recovery. The  Government needs to step up its efforts or else more precious Australian native  wildlife will be lost.
