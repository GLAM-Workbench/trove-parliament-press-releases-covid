QUESTIONS SCOTT MORRISON MUST ANSWER ABOUT AGED CARE  FAILURES

Scott Morrison must answer questions about the growing list of shocking Commonwealth  Government failures to prepare Australia’s aged care system for COVID-19.

Why did the Government and its regulator fail to have any national plan for COVID-19 in  aged care?

Is the Prime Minister confident that the nursing homes which have failed standards across  the country over recent months, including 14 in New South Wales alone, are safe for  residents?

Why did the Morrison Government not learn from previous recommendations that called on  the Federal Government to improve information sharing between the regulator and the  Federal Department of Health when this issue shockingly led to a four day delay in acting  at St Basil’s?

Does the Prime Minister continue to have confidence in the aged care regulator’s ability to  deal with tragic outbreaks of COVID-19 in aged care after this catastrophic  communications failure?

When did the Prime Minister become aware the regulator did have knowledge of the  outbreak of COVID-19 at St Basil’s but failed to pass it on to the Federal Department of  Health?

Why did the Morrison Government not learn from tragic outbreaks of COVID-19 at Dorothy  Henderson Lodge and Newmarch House?

Why was the Morrison Government not better prepared for outbreaks that would impact  our nation’s most vulnerable?
