PRIME MINISTER FAILS TO COMMIT TO A NATIONAL YOUTH STRATEGY



Young people from across Australia were today looking to Scott Morrison for leadership and a plan,

but instead they were met with more spin.



At todayâ€™s Youth Futures Summit, the Prime Minister was asked whether his government will commit

to developing a national youth strategy

Scott Morrison failed to give such a commitment.



The issues facing young people, including high unemployment and underemployment, social

isolation, depleted retirement savings, interruptions to education and training, housing insecurity and

mental health challenges, cannot be properly addressed in isolation.



That is why last week Labor called for the Prime Minister and the Minister for Youth to urgently

implement a COVID-19 Youth Recovery Strategy.



Young people are clearly not a priority for the Coalition Government - with no national youth strategy

developed for a decade, no Office for Youth, and a distracted Youth Minister.



Now more than ever, in the midst of the greatest challenge this generation has ever faced, our

young people need a strategy and leadership from their Government.



We cannot leave an entire generation of Australians behind.
