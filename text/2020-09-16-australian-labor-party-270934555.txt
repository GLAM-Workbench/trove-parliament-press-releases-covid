TWO YEARS ON FROM ROYAL COMMISSION ANNOUNCEMENT

AUSTRALIA’S AGED CARE SYSTEM IS EVEN MORE BROKEN UNDER

SCOTT MORRISON



Today marks two year since Scott Morrison called the Royal Commission into aged care

but older Australians dealing with the broken system won’t be celebrating.



Scott Morrison promised the Royal Commission would not stop his Government improving

aged care however the devastating evidence shows the system is worse than ever.



“For this reason, our Government has decided to establish a Royal Commission into

Australia’s aged care system. I should stress that conducting the Royal Commission will

not impact any existing or planned actions to improve the standards and quality of care

being provided in aged care facilities.”

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ SCOTT MORRISON, 16 SEPTEMBER 2018

On every measure Australia’s aged care system has gone backwards under Scott

Morrison.



Most tragically more than 600 older Australians have passed away from COVID-19 in aged

care after the Morrison Government failed to implement a plan to deal with the virus.



There were more than 100,000 older Australians waiting list home care when Scott

Morrison called the Royal Commission and there are still more than 100,000 waiting today.



Despite talking a big game, new admissions to home care actually dropped in the year

after Scott Morrison called the Royal Commission.



Complaints in aged care continue to rise every year, including more than 7,800 recorded in

2018-19 alone.



Reported assaults in residential aged care go up every year and shockingly hit 5,233 in

2018-19 or more than 100 a week.



Recent evidence revealed that unreported assaults in aged care are likely to be more than

50,000 every year.



In response to this terrible evidence, Scott Morrison doesn’t even listen to the Royal

Commission.



Shockingly, when the Royal Commission called out the Government’s failure to plan for

COVID-19 in aged care all the Prime Minister did was reject its evidence.



Scott Morrison has failed to properly respond to his own Royal Commission’s call in its

interim report for urgent action on the home care waiting list which the Commissioners

called ‘neglect’.



How can anyone trust this Morrison Government to respond to the Royal Commission’s

final report in February when its not even listening now?



Day after day the evidence mounts of serious neglect in aged care and every day all we

see from the Morrison Government is running away, passing the buck and not accepting

responsibility for its own failures.



Neglect. That’s the legacy of this Government when it comes to aged care.



Australians deserve better.
