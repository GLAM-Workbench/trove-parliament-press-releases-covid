$68.25 million for frontline domestic violence support services

The Morrison Government’s $150 million domestic violence response package is expanding  perpetrator interventions, providing case management for survivors through court processes,  producing tech-enabled support services and increasing safe accommodation capacity.

States and territories have now received the full $130 million allocation, through a September  payment of $68.25 million to help frontline family and domestic violence support services across  Australia adapt to meet changing needs during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Morrison Government has made a total of four payments under the $130 million to states and  territories under the National Partnership Agreement announced in May.

The total funding for each jurisdiction includes:  Ã¯ÂÂ· New South Wales - $39,651,901  Ã¯ÂÂ· Victoria - $31,547,742  Ã¯ÂÂ· Queensland - $25,637,951  Ã¯ÂÂ· Western Australia - $14,243,563  Ã¯ÂÂ· South Australia - $9,796,052  Ã¯ÂÂ· Tasmania - $3,636,144  Ã¯ÂÂ· Australian Capital Territory - $3,024,371  Ã¯ÂÂ· Northern Territory - $2,462,273



Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Women Senator the Hon. Marise Payne said the  Government was ensuring services had the capacity to support women and their children during  the lock downs and as the country opens back up.

“Our response has enabled the states and territories the flexibility to respond to the situation as it  has presented in a localised way,” Minister Payne said.

“Each jurisdiction is working hard to ensure these funds flow through to frontline family and  domestic violence support services and target the areas where funding is most needed.”



Minister for Families and Social Services Senator the Hon. Anne Ruston said the Commonwealth  was using the remaining $20 million from the package to raise awareness of the national helplines  1800RESPECT and MensLine Australia.

“More than half of all Australians have seen our Help is Here campaign which has raised awareness  of 1800RESPECT and MensLine Australia to 44 per cent and 35 per cent of all Australians,  respectively,” Minister Ruston said.

“Our funding has also supported both helplines to respond to changes in demand and how people  are accessing support with more people choosing to use online chat functions.”
