GRANTS HELP PRESERVE AUSTRALIA’S WARTIME HERITAGE

COMMUNITY groups and organisations across the country committed to preserving Australia’s  wartime heritage will share in more than $1 million in funding through the Saluting Their Service  Commemorative Grants Program.

Minister for Veterans’ Affairs Darren Chester said the recipients of this round of grant funding were  making a vital contribution to preserving our military history and bringing the community together  through projects and activities that commemorate our service personnel.

“Community-led commemorative projects play a very important part in helping Australians learn  about the crucial role of our service personnel and recognising their courage and sacrifice in serving  our nation,” Mr Chester said.

“These grants will assist local communities, from funding restoration work and flagpole installations,  to supporting theatre performances and online commemorative websites, which are just some of  the projects receiving support this round.”

The coronavirus pandemic represents a significant challenge for many grant recipients. The  Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) recognises the impact on projects due to social distancing and  other public health measures in place across the country.

“There are a number of challenges that need to be overcome this year, in particular for those  wanting to hold events and commemorative activities, and we as a government are aware of the  need for extra support for recipients and have made provisions for that,” Mr Chester said.

“DVA is committed to working with recipients who are affected to extend their funding agreements  so they have more time to complete their projects, or find alternative options.

“These projects will leave a lasting legacy in communities and educate the next generation - helping  to solidify the memory of Australian service men and women.”

Further information on the Saluting Their Service grants can be accessed on the Community Grants  Hub website. For a list of recipients, see below.
