Warning over imported ’home’ COVID-19 test kits

The Coalition Government is urging Australian’s to be wary of faulty ‘home’ COVID-19 tests  kits after Australian Border Force officers intercepted a number of imported consignments  in recent weeks.

The first consignment of 200 units originated from China and arrived in Perth as air cargo via  Singapore on Monday, 16 March 2020.

Similar detections have now been made in Perth (50 units) on 23 March, and Melbourne (39  units) on 27 March, both originating in Hong Kong.

Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton said these tests could present a serious risk to public  health and warned they would undermine the vital, lifesaving work of health professionals.

“Inaccurate results could prevent people from seeking the medical help they need, or  alternatively, discourage people who should be self-isolating from doing so,” Minister  Dutton said.

“The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has ruled the tests kits as unapproved  medical devices. These are risks the Australian community simply can’t afford to be taking at  this critical time.

“Our ABF officers at the border are on alert for any unauthorised or homemade COVID-19  products and they will continue working day and night to ensure these dangerous goods  don’t make it into Australian households and communities,” Minister Dutton said.

The TGA has confirmed that the test kits are not registered for use in Australia and the  importers did not have approval to import them.

The only approved tests for COVID-19 in Australia currently are laboratory based tests or  tests that can be used by health professionals at the point of care such as in hospitals or  clinics.
