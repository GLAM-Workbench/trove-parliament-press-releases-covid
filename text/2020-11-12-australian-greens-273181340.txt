UNI ENROLMENT SLUMP REVEALS GENDERED DOWNTURN

12 November 2020



The Greens have responded to new ABS data showing an alarming drop in women  studying at university in 2020 as compared to 2019.

Senator Mehreen Faruqi, Greens spokesperson for Education, said:

“I’ve said from the very start that women have borne the brunt of the impacts of  Covid-19.

“These numbers challenge the assumption that people will enrol to study when  there’s an economic downturn. Women are still doing much of the unpaid care  work during these hard times. They are the ones now having to give up the  opportunity to go to uni.

“The government’s plan to hike up university fees and cut funding for courses with  a high proportion of women enrolled will be another barrier to university education.

“With the Covid recession rolling on, the government should be making it easier for  women to go to uni, not hiking up fees and cutting course funding,” she said.

Senator Larissa Waters, Greens spokesperson for Women, said:

“The Morrison Government never thinks twice about how its policies will  disproportionately disadvantage women and widen the gender pay gap, and the  increase in uni fees is a perfect example.



“You don’t find inequities if you don’t look for them, and that’s why this Government  needs more women in Cabinet and a Women’s Budget Impact Statement to reveal  the gendered impacts of their decisions.”
