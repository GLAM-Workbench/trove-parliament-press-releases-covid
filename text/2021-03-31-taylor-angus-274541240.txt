LOWER POWER BILLS FOR HIGH ENERGY USING BUSINESSES

High energy using businesses across Australia are being supported by the Morrison  Government to cut energy costs and improve their resilience as the economy recovers  from COVID-19.

Through the Government’s Energy Efficient Communities Program, 48 businesses that  consume more than 0.05 petajoules of energy annually have been awarded grants of up  to $25,000 to implement energy efficiency opportunities that will help lower their  power bills.

Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said bringing down the cost  of energy for businesses is a priority of the Morrison Government.

“For these businesses in particular, energy costs are a high proportion of their operating  expenses,” Minister Taylor said.

“This program was targeted and designed to help large businesses such as  manufacturers, smelters and food producers to reduce these costs and support jobs and  communities across the country that rely on their operations.”

“Supporting industry to reinvest in their businesses, grow, thrive and employ more  Australians has never been more important as we emerge from the COVID-19  recession.”

Successful applicants will match the grants with an equally-sized co-contribution.

The successful projects include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ upgrading lighting to LEDs at a sawmill in Penola, South Australia;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ insulating piping, steam valves and flanges to reduce heat loss in a production  process at a paper manufacturer in Campbellfield, Victoria; and   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ reducing equipment air leaks and power use at an aluminium smelter in Bell Bay,

Tasmania



The Energy Efficient Communities Program was announced as part of the Government’s  $3.5 billion Climate Solutions Package to deliver on Australia’s 2030 climate  commitments.
