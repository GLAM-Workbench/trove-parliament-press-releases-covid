SECURING FREIGHT ACCESS FOR AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL  AND FISHERIES EXPORTERS

A new $110 million initiative will back Australia’s agricultural and fisheries sector by helping them  export their high-quality produce into key overseas markets, with return flights bringing back vital  medical supplies, medicines and equipment.

In addition, around $10 million in Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) levies will also  be waived for all Commonwealth fishers, ensuring they do not have to pay Commonwealth levies for  the remainder of 2020.

Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said the International Freight Assistance Mechanism  would help secure freight flights into Australia’s key export markets.

“This will help restore key freight routes for our farmers until commercial capacity can be restored  again,” Mr McCormack said.

“We are doing everything possible to help our high-value agricultural and fisheries exporters get their  produce on airplanes and into overseas markets.

“Everything we are doing as a Government in response to this pandemic is focused on saving lives  and saving livelihoods and we know our agriculture industry is key to this.”

Federal Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said the COVID-19 pandemic had led to major air freight  shortages and had disrupted supply chains around the world.

“This temporary action will help Australian producers to protect the jobs of those who rely upon  Australia’s export of safe, quality food into the world,” Minister Birmingham said.

“Getting our export sector back on its feet is crucial to reduce job losses through the crisis and a  critical part of the ultimate economic recovery.



“By getting flights off the ground, full of Australian produce, we’re supporting our farmers and fishers  who have been hit hard by this crisis.”

Federal Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said this initiative would focus on high-demand  agricultural and fisheries exports who have been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis.

“We’re backing our farmers by making sure they can get more of their high-quality product into  overseas markets,” Minister Littleproud said.

“The more agricultural exports we can secure, the more regional jobs we can protect.”

Assistant Minister for Forestry and Fisheries Jonno Duniam said the freight assistance and levy relief  was a lifeline for Australian fishers.

“The fishing industry was one of the first hit when access to China was cut off in January, bringing  many in the industry to their knees,” Assistant Minister Duniam said.

“Unlocking key international markets will get thousands of fishers, divers, deckhands and processors  back on the job, and the levy relief will help to keep fishers financially afloat.

“Our seafood industry has been built on the back of some of the toughest and most resilient  Australians, and this assistance will ensure that the sector can build a bridge to recovery.”

The International Freight Assistance Mechanism will initially focus on the key markets of China,  Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and the UAE, with four key departure hubs: Melbourne, Sydney,  Brisbane and Perth.

It will be overseen by Mr Michael Byrne, who has been appointed as the International Freight  Coordinator General. Mr Byrne has significant international logistics experience as Managing Director  of Australia’s two largest logistics companies Toll Holdings and Linfox plus as a non-executive director  of Australia Post.

Mr Byrne will work with Austrade to help establish arrangements with exporters, airlines, freight  forwarders and industry bodies plus oversee the mechanism’s operations including advising the  Government of destinations, freight selection and prioritisation.

The initiative is part of the Government’s $1 billion Relief and Recovery Fund to support regions,  communities and industry sectors that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

COVID-19 RELIEF AND RECOVERY FUND  AIRFREIGHT SUPPORT FOR ESSENTIAL AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY INDUSTRIES

The Australian Government has set aside $1 billion through the COVID-19 Relief and  Recovery Fund to support communities, regions and industries most significantly  affected by the economic impacts of coronavirus, including those heavily reliant on  sectors such as aviation, agriculture, tourism, arts and education.

Summary

The Australian Government is backing Australia’s agriculture and seafood export sectors through a  new $110 million initiative to help exporters get their high-quality produce into key overseas  markets, with return flights bringing back vital medical supplies, medicines and equipment critical to  the ongoing health response.

Key facts

What produce is  eligible?  The target is high-value agricultural and fisheries exports, predominantly for  perishable products where Australian exporters have important established

customers in markets.

The sort of products that may be eligible include seafood (including  lobsters), premium red meat (including beef and pork), dairy (such as fresh  milk and yoghurt) and horticulture (such as premium fruits and packaged  salad or vegetables).  Food products will be exported subject to adequate  domestic supply.

Given the economics of airfreight, low value products are not likely to be  eligible.  This will include those that are heavy and/or bulky, are  conventionally (or could be) shipped by sea, where the market is not open  to airfreight of the commodity, and export via airfreight is not likely to be  economically viable on an ongoing basis.

This temporary action will help Australian producers to protect the jobs of  those who rely upon Australia’s export of safe, quality and premium food to  the world.

What are the  destination  countries?

Target countries will be determined by demand and freight optimisation  criteria as advised by the International Freight Coordinator General.

The International Freight Assistance Mechanism will initially focus on the  key markets of China, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and the UAE.  This list  may be expanded in future based on demand, operating method and  commercial opportunities.

Where are the  departure points  from Australia?

Departure points will be determined by demand and freight optimisation  criteria as advised by the International Freight Coordinator General.

The initial departure points for freight will be Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane  and Perth.

Noting that many exporters are outside of these hubs, the Mechanism will  provide for other departure points where possible, including departures  from regional airports servicing international markets, depending on  demand and aircraft dynamics.  This will include connectivity from South  Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and Far North Queensland.

How do I apply to  send my premium  goods to these  initial markets?

The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment is setting up an  information line and a process to capture from exporters information on  the products outlined above.

The contact details to express interest are:

Website and dedicated enquiry form:  https://haveyoursay.agriculture.gov.au/

Telephone: (02) 6272 2444

What information  will be required for  me to apply?

Businesses will be requested to supply the following details:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Business name, ABN and contact details

Ã¯ÂÂ· When the business could start exporting

Ã¯ÂÂ· Routes: Preferred departure airport and destination airport

Ã¯ÂÂ· Information on product type, type of freight (i.e. wet or dry),  frequency of despatch per week (and specific day), volume (cubic  meters) and weight (tonnes).

Who will decide  which products are  eligible and when  they will be  leaving?

The Government has appointed one of Australia’s most experienced  logistics professionals, Mr Michael Byrne, as International Freight  Coordinator General.

Mr Byrne will advise the Government on operational aspects such as  departure points, arrival points, freight mix, product eligibility and other  factors.

What is the scope  of Government  financial  assistance?

The Government is mindful that airfreight has been constrained in both  capacity and cost.  This Mechanism intends to address both.  The  Government also recognises end-market prices are currently showing  variability.

The Government expects exporters to make a financial contribution to the  cost of their freight, recognising the historical cost-base for this activity,  likely at a premium to conventional transport rates.

Where possible, the Mechanism will coordinate with airfreight support  being provided by State and Territory Governments to achieve economies  of scale and the most cost effective outcome possible for exporters.

When will the first  flight leave?  The Government is working hard to stand-up this initiative quickly, including  determining demand by location and freight types, negotiations with

aircraft providers, settlement of quarantine and global landing rights and  other issues.

Based on current progress, the first flight is likely to leave within two weeks.

How frequently  will flights leave?  The Mechanism is not limited by a flight schedule.  Flight schedules by  departure point and arrival point will be determined by demand and market

access.

Flights will be expedited as soon as they are full of valuable exports.

Can I organise my  own flight and still  be assisted by  Government?

Once the Mechanism is established, financial assistance will generally only  be available to freight travelling as part of the Mechanism.

In the very near-term, industries organising their own flights with advanced  arrangements for early departure may be eligible for assistance where  excessive costs are threatening the viability of such flights.

What aircraft will  service the routes?  Aircraft types will be determined by demand, end market, and freight  optimisation criteria as advised by the International Freight Coordinator

General.

The Government is mindful that some freight has specialist needs and will  seek to accommodate these where full loads can be arranged.

For how long will  the scheme  operate?

The Government appreciates that exporters need certainty over the  medium-term.

The Mechanism is intended to operate until ordinary commercial markets  return, or for six months, whichever is the earlier.  If demand, value and  need are clear, the Mechanism may be extended.

I have items for  return to Australia,  whom do I contact  to facilitate this?

Backhaul items will be focussed on vital medical supplies, medicines and  equipment as determined by the Department of Health.

Other nationally important items may be designated by the Department of  Home Affairs.

General freight is not eligible for the Mechanism.

Who do I contact  for further  information, or to  register interest?

The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment is setting up an  information line and a process to capture from exporters information on  the products outlined above.
