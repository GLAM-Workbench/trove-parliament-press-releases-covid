Record funding for aged care infrastructure



Senior  Australians  in  regional,  rural  and  remote  areas will benefit  from  the  single  largest   investment in residential aged care infrastructure in Australia’s history.

The Australian Government will invest up to $150 million in capital grants as part of the 2020  targeted Aged Care Approvals Round (ACAR), focussed on key areas of demand.

The 2020 ACAR will also make available 2000 residential care places targeting providers in a  position to bring new beds onto the market quickly.

Additionally, 1028 short-term restorative care (STRC) places, will also be made available.

A further 8000 places will remain on hold pending the final report of the Royal Commission  into Aged Care Quality and Safety.

The $150 million in grants are available to fund a range of activities focussed on improving  access to quality residential aged care services in areas outside of the major cities.

The  residential  care  places  in  this  ACAR  are targeted  to  providers  who can  commence   delivering care immediately or within 18 months.

Priorities for funding include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ upgrades  to  create more spacious  rooms,  increase  privacy and  decrease the need  for  shared living quarters;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ a focus on dementia-friendly services aimed at allowing those diagnosed with dementia  living in the bush to remain in their communities;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ improved infection prevention and control measures; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ help for providers in financial stress to bring their allocations of residential care places  online, including those impacted by bushfires and COVID-19;

Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Richard Colbeck, said the $150 million in grant  funding represents a major commitment to regional, rural and remote Australia.

“Now  is  the  time  to  back  providers  to  develop  and  deliver  quality residential  care  services   where  they  are  needed  most,  as  well  as  boost  the  economy  through  jobs  creation  in  the   construction and aged care sectors,” Minister Colbeck said.

In addition to the grant funding, the 2000 residential care places on offer will accommodate  those providers  which have made significant  progress with residential  care expansion  plans   ensuring care can be provided faster.

“On  top  of  this,  we  have  boosted  the  number  of  STRC places available to  more  than  one   thousand, which assists more senior Australians to improve their independence and limit the  need for higher levels of care,” Minister Colbeck said.

The impacts of the pandemic response, coupled with the generational reforms well underway,  have required a refocus of the 2020 ACAR, he said.

“The pre-COVID-19 landscape for conducting an ACAR looked a lot different to where we  are now.

“We are also drawing closer to the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety’s  final report in February.”

Minister Colbeck said that prior to its postponement due to COVID-19, the 2020 ACAR was  going to make available 10,000 residential care places and 750 STRC places.

“We  are working towards  increasing  supply  subject  to  the  recommendations  of  the  Royal   Commission’s final report

“Residential care places can often take over four years to become operational.

“It  is therefore  pragmatic  to  wait  for  the  preferred  reform  pathway  to  be  in  place,  before  allocating places to projects that take this amount of time.”

Applications for the latest ACAR round open for three months from December 18.
