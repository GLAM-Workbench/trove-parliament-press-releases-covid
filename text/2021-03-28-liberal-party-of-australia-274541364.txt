Over 500,000 Australians vaccinated against COVID-19

Australia’s COVID-19 vaccination program is well under way, with more than 500,000  Australians receiving a free jab as part of the Phase 1 rollout.

There have been more than 507,000 vaccines at the close of business on Friday. 329,000  vaccines have been administered in state and territory vaccination clinics, 97,000 vaccines  have been administered in general practices and more than 80,000 aged care residents have  been vaccinated.

Our GP’s have played a vital role in this expansion and have not only been vaccinating over  the week, but many practices are continuing to vaccinate on Saturday and Sunday this  weekend.

Over 1,100 general practices, GP-led respiratory clinics and Aboriginal Community  Controlled Health Services are already providing vaccinations to people eligible in Phase 1b.

This will grow to a broad national footprint of more than 4,000 general practices by the end of  April. These will be complemented by more than 100 Commonwealth Vaccination Clinics  and more than 100 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community Controlled Health  Services.

The roll out for the next week and further expansion is now well underway. The first of the 50  million Australian made CSL doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine have already been  distributed and will now be distributed on an ongoing basis.

As part of our Vaccination Strategy, Australia placed an absolute priority on sovereign  domestic vaccine production at CSL in August last year.

That decision has ensured that Australia is one of the few countries with strong, clear  domestic supplies going forwards.
