A PARADIGM SHIFT FOR DEFENCE RESERVES



KEYNOTE ADDRESS TO DEFENCE RESERVES ASSOCIATION NATIONAL

CONFERENCE 2020

SATURDAY, 7 NOVEMBER 2020

BY VIDEO



*** CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY ***





Thank you for the invitation to speak to the Defence Reserves Association National

Conference 2020 and provide a video message.



It’s a pleasure to be representing Federal Labor, and our Deputy Leader and Shadow

Minister for Defence, Richard Marles.



Rather like Anzac Day this year, even if we can’t gather physically, I’m sure we will be

together in spirit.



I’m speaking to you today from my Electorate Office in Ipswich, so I would like to begin by

acknowledging the Traditional Owners, the Jagera, Yuggera and Ugarapul peoples, of this

land, and pay my respect to their Elders, past, present and emerging.



I would also like to acknowledge and thank:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢    The conference organisers, in particular, Major General Paul Irving, National President

of the Defence Reserves Association (‘DRA’) and the DRA Executive;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢    The other speakers and contributors; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢    All members of the DRA who will be viewing the conference proceedings today.



Thank you for the contribution you make to policy development and for keeping us

informed and honest when it comes to Defence Reserves.



I note the theme for this year’s Conference is “Quo Vadis - An Integrated Future” - where

we will aim to discuss the progress made and some of the crucial challenges facing

Government, the Australian Defence Force (‘ADF’), the Department of Defence and

employers with a fully integrated Defence Force.



I’m delighted to have the opportunity to set out the Opposition’s position on this.



Of course ‘Quo Vadis’ in Latin means ‘where are you - or we - going’?



It’s an important reminder that, just like navigating towards an objective, we need to ask

ourselves where do we want to be in terms of our Defence and Reserves strategy, and just

as importantly, how do we get there?



This conference and future discussions will help inform Labor’s Reserves policy and our

position on integrating the Reserves in the ADF as we approach the next election.



So I look forward to seeing the outcomes of this event.



For our part, Labor will continue to work with the Government, in a bipartisan way as much

as possible, to ensure our defence personnel have a strong voice in Parliament, and get

the support and the resources they need.



Of course, we will have our points of disagreement from time to time - as you would

expect in a robust democracy like ours.



But we both want to do everything we can to look after our Reservists as they look after us

and ensure that we set them up for success so that they can do their job.



As you know, for more than 100 years, Reservists have played a key role in the defence of

the nation and continue to be a key part of our integrated Defence Force.



Labor has always had a strong commitment to supporting our Defence Reserves and their

contribution to the ADF.



This is why in 2011, the former Labor government launched Project SUAKIN.



This resulted in the Total Workforce Model (‘TWM’) or Total Workforce System (‘TWS’),

which aims to provide Defence with the flexibility and agility it needs to meet its current and

future workforce needs.



Labor knows that people are our most valuable asset, and to attract and retain the right

people, Defence needs a modern, flexible and agile workforce environment.



The TWM is designed to give Defence greater organisational flexibility and give members

better access to flexible workplace arrangements to allow for better work-life balance

between people’s personal circumstances and the organisation’s needs.



Importantly, the TWM encourages mobility between the Regular and Reserve components

of the ADF and enhances the ability of the services to draw efficiently upon different

workforce mixes to meet capability needs.



And by maximising the contributions of all members, the TWM can allow Defence to

maintain an operational edge by drawing on the vast range of skills and experience across

the community - including in the Reserves - in a more agile and integrated way.



But how do we build on that to provide better surge capacity and ensure our Reserve

Forces can be used to build on the success of the total force?



We only need to look at recent events to see how these have helped drive greater

integration of the ADF.



The ADF is a critical part of the national response to emergencies and the Reserves, and

in particular the Army Reserve, have a long history of providing assistance to the

community in relation to serious natural disasters.



And the Australian community rightly expects that the Federal Government will call on the

ADF to assist the various State and Territory emergency response organisations and the

community in dealing with serious natural disasters or other emergencies.



This was never more evident than during the devastating 2019-20 bushfire season, and

more recently the coronavirus pandemic.



As the Shadow Minister for Defence Personnel with responsibility for Reserves, I know our

Reservists have often answered the call when natural disasters strike, at home and in our

region, and provided humanitarian assistance in times of crisis.



That’s why Labor welcomed the compulsory call out of our Defence Reserves to provide

greater support to those communities affected by the catastrophic bushfires last summer -

in fact, Labor had called for more ADF assistance much earlier.



That call out order - the first ever during peacetime - saw around 3,000 Reservists,

together with regular ADF personnel, provide invaluable support to state fire and

emergency services as part of Operation Bushfire Assist.



I had the opportunity to attend a Parliamentary Friends of Defence Briefing from Operation

Commander Major General Jake Ellwood in February.



I remember speaking with General Ellwood at the briefing and telling him how I have seen

first-hand the full spectrum of emergency responses in my own community over the years.



I was a child when the 1974 flood devastated Southeast Queensland and flooded my

family home in Ipswich - the water went over the roof.



I vividly recall soldiers and Army trucks helping to move furniture and belongings from our

house before it was flooded, for which I was extremely grateful.



Then in 2011, my electorate of Blair, based around Ipswich, was heavily impacted by the

Queensland floods that year.

As the Federal Member, I liaised between the different levels of government and assisted

in the coordination of efforts on the ground.



But frankly, I was disappointed by the slow roll-out of ADF support during that flood event.



What this demonstrates is the importance of getting our disaster recovery arrangements

right, and having effective coordination between the Commonwealth, States and local

government, and between Defence and civilian authorities.



And it highlights the importance of taking on board the lessons learned from every

disaster.



This is vitally important because, if anything, the requirement for ADF assistance in relation

to serious natural disasters and other emergencies is likely to expand, rather than diminish

going forward, as a result of climate change with a higher operational tempo.



Of course, Labor - along with just about every other major organisation in the country -

has known for years of the challenges posed by climate change and more frequent and

extreme weather events, and we’ve been ahead of the game on the need for mitigation

and adaptation measures to deal with this.



We know that even Defence has been out ahead of the Government in sounding warnings

for some time of a deteriorating security outlook caused by climate risks.



Regrettably, the Coalition’s stance on the issue has really held back military planning and

preparedness on climate, making it more difficult for Defence to integrate it into its strategic

planning.



So it’s pleasing that the Morrison Government seems to be starting to take this issue more

seriously, even if this has been driven partly by its poor handling of the Black Summer

bushfire crisis.



Flowing from this, the role of the Army Reserve in domestic operations is  likely to increase

with the decision by the Chief of Army on 1 October 2020 to formally assign domestic

operations, excluding counter terrorism, to the 2nd Division of the Army, which is made up

of thousands of Reservists across the country.



Indeed, this was revealed in the final report last week of the Royal Commission into

National Natural Disaster Arrangements (or the Bushfire Royal Commission).



The ADF has been preparing for this increased role, after the Government directed it to

"enhance capacity to support civil authorities in response to natural disasters and crisis,"

as part of the 2020 Defence Strategic Update released in July.



Some in Defence are describing this as a "paradigm shift" or “new normal” that is very

much focused on the security impacts of climate change.



Under this new strategy, many Reservists are likely to play an active role through call-out

orders to support state and territory emergency services responding to natural disasters,

as we saw in the 2019-20 bushfires.



We understand this new strategy will draw on specialist units, including engineers and

logistics, health and communications, which are "light on the ground but in high demand",

and could be reinforced with the engagement of contractors.



This is in contrast to more conventional capabilities like infantry, which are not as ideally

suited to this new paradigm.



Defence has said around 3,000 part-time and 18,000 full-time personnel have now

received training to support domestic response operations.



In the future, we understand the Army expects to prepare more teams to support the Joint

Force, for more tasks, in more places, more of the time.



More capacity will likely come from making use of the total workforce as One Army -

drawing on a mix of full-time, flexible work, part-time, contingent work, contractors and the

Australian Public Service.



I suppose necessity is the mother of invention and here we have an excellent example of

the TWM and an integrated ‘One ADF’ in practice.



To enable this greater integration, the Government recently introduced legislation into the

Parliament to better support Reserve call outs.



The Defence Legislation Amendment (Enhancement of Defence Force Response to

Emergencies) Bill 2020 passed the House of Representatives on 6 October 2020 with

Labor’s support, and is currently before the Senate where it has been subject to a Senate

inquiry.



The Bill seeks to promote a more fully integrated Defence Force.



The measures in the Bill are intended to improve existing arrangements for the ADF and

other Defence personnel to provide assistance during natural disasters and other

emergencies.



As I alluded to earlier, these measures were developed following consideration within

Defence of lessons learnt during the 2019-20 bushfires, and also align with the interim

observations and draft propositions of the Bushfire Royal Commission.



Of course, we now have the benefit of the Royal Commission’s final report.



The measures in the Bill are involve fairly modest amendments to the Defence Act 1903 to

streamline processes for Reserve call outs, and to provide ADF members and other

personnel with protection from liability when they are providing assistance, similar to

protections available to emergency services workers in State and Territory legislation.



The changes will make administration of a Reserve call out easier, and will align conditions

of service between called out Reserve members and Reserve members who have

volunteered.



Labor consulted with key defence personnel and Reserve representative bodies, including

the DRA, which I know is supportive of the changes under the Bill and the increased

flexibility these should provide, in part due to the TWM workplace reforms initiated by

Labor in government.



I note the DRA considers that overall, this will be a positive step for Reservists and

Reserve service.



In particular, the introduction of superannuation benefits to called out Reservists backdated

to November 2019 will ensure Reserve members undertaking Continuous Full Time

Service under a call out order will get the same entitlement to super and related benefits

regardless of whether their service was voluntary or not, which will improve fairness for

these members.



In addition, decoupling Reserve call outs from the requirement for Continuous Full-time

Service (or ‘CFTS’), and allowing the Chief of the Defence Force to direct a Reserve

member’s period of service during a call out - that is, allow call out on the basis of either

Reserve Service Days or CFTS, depending on the nature of the task - allows greater

flexibility in call out procedures, is administratively easier, and may be less costly for

Defence.



Further, the proposed changes and additional flexibility will make it easier to utilise

personnel with niche or specialist skills as part of a call out in response to an emergency to

provide service in disaster relief, particularly in the case of doctors, lawyers and chaplains.



This is entirely consistent with the concept of ‘One ADF’.



In addition, the DRA has made the useful point that Reserve Service Days often involve

less record-keeping on the part of units compared to CFTS, so it will be important to

maintain a paper trail for members using Reserve Service Days during a call out in the

event, for example, of future compensation claims in relation to this service.



While this point does not necessarily go to the substance of the Bill, it is very constructive

feedback for how the legislation should be implemented and administered going forward.



I am very mindful of our duty to look after our personnel, not just during their service, but

after it as well, and also the need for good data and information sharing between Defence

and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs.



So while we are broadly supportive of this legislation, Labor is aware of concerns about

some elements of the bill, including the immunity provisions and that it could give rise to a

greater power on the part of the minister in relation to call-outs generally.



In light of this, we believed there was value in having a short Parliamentary inquiry into the

legislation to address these issues, and we moved to refer it to a Senate Foreign Affairs,

Defence and Trade Legislation Committee inquiry on 8 October.



I note DRA National President Major General Paul Irving made a submission and

appeared before the committee’s public hearing recently, and I want to thank him for his

wise input and contribution.



The Senate inquiry has just reported back, on 4 November, and recommends that the Bill

be passed.



However, it has made a number of suggestions about amending the Explanatory

Memorandum to the Bill to clarify the intention and operation of the legislation.



Labor will reserve its final position in the Senate until we have had an opportunity to

consider the report and the Government’s response to it.



Notwithstanding this, Labor is supportive of the legislation in-principle as it will promote a

more integrated ADF and support a bigger role for the Reserves in domestic operations.



We will always work constructively to ensure Australia is as prepared as possible for

natural disasters and emergencies.



So, now that we know where we want to be, the question is how do we get there?



This is because for a fully integrated Defence Force to succeed, we need to know where

the resources and the people are going to come from.



The 2020 Defence Strategic Update and Force Structure Plan (or ‘FSP’), released in July,

was accompanied by some additional funding and a fairly vague plan to boost personnel

numbers.



When it comes to Reserves, the current workforce total includes around 40,000 personnel,

comprising 29,000 active reservists and 11,000 ‘contingent workforce personnel’.



The FSP emphasised the ‘recapitalisation of Reserves’ in boosting training that is

commensurate with the permanent force to ensure more rapid deployment of Reserve

forces.



However, despite committing Defence to put a higher priority on disaster response and

resilience, the document barely mentions climate change, other than to say it is

compounding threats to human security.



Furthermore, in recent years, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (or ‘ASPI’) has

pointed out that the Government has consistently failed to meet its Defence recruitment

targets, including under the 2016 Defence White Paper.



In addition, it has estimated the personnel component of the Defence budget will fall from

37 per cent to 26 per cent by 2026 based on the 2016 White Paper figures and updated

FSP figures.



ASPI questions how sustainable this balance will be over the long term given the size and

quantity of new platforms in production and the anticipated expansion of the Defence

workforce in order to operate and maintain the new capability.



Labor is concerned that the Government has delayed a detailed new workforce strategy to

grow the ADF until late 2021.



The reality is one of the biggest challenges for Defence remains personnel and skills

shortages, and yet the Government seems to be treating it as something of an

afterthought.



So the Government has serious questions to answer about how it will grow the ADF and

whether we will have enough people, including Reservists, to operate this new strategy

and future force.



We will be looking very closely at the new workforce strategy when it’s delivered next year

to see that it addresses these issues.



It’s possible the new domestic strategy will require more funding, so this is an issue the

Government will need to address too, in particular to invest in the new personnel we are

likely to need.



Again, if we are to achieve a fully integrated Total Force, the Government needs to do

more to recruit, train and retain many more highly skilled service men and women,

including Reservists, or we simply will not be able to meet these future challenges.



At the end of the day, all the capability in the world is no good to a defence force without

the necessary people to operate and maintain it.



In relation to the ADF’s growing role in emergency management, some former senior

defence officials (including former Chief of the Defence Force Admiral Chris Barrie) have

warned that call-outs could make the Reserves less attractive to potential volunteers and

impact recruitment, if people are going to lose their jobs, or find it difficult to run their

businesses.



Of course, Reserves service relies very much on the continued support of the community,

including families and partners, employers and educational institutions - and for that we

thank them sincerely.



And it’s why having structures and systems in place to facilitate this through the TWM and

flexible workplace arrangements is vitally important.



This is where protections in place for Reservists will be critical.



Many existing conditions of service protections for Reservists’ civilian employment under

the Defence Reserves Service (Protection) Act 2001 passed by the Parliament in 2015

were based on an earlier review of the legislation completed by Major General Greg

Garde.



The Defence Legislation Amendment (Enhancement of Defence Force Response to

Emergencies) Bill 2020 that I discussed earlier refines some of these employment

protections under the Act, and extends to Reservists the civil immunities already enjoyed

by personnel from the various state and territory emergency and rural fire services.



As DRA members would know, the Act compels employers to release Reservists when

they are required to undertake periods of service and training.



However, we have heard this is not always reflected in terms of the reality on the ground -

with many workplaces still not required to have a Reserve leave policy, or where policies

do exist, they are not consistent.



So there is still room for improvement in this space.



And at a time when Reservists are likely to be called out more frequently in future, and so

may be in need of greater representation, it was regrettable that the Government decided

to abolish the longstanding Defence Reserves Support Council (or ‘DRSC’) in a shock

announcement late last year.



For more than 40 years, the DRSC had built positive relationships between Defence,

industry, Reserve welfare organisations like the DRA, unions and the community, and

played an important role in increasing understanding and support for Reserve service.



I was very critical of the decision to scrap this body at the time given it followed a secret

review and minimal consultation with the DRSC and its members.



I understand the new replacement body is made up of industry and big business employer

representatives hand-picked by Defence, with next to no Ministerial responsibility or

oversight, so I remain sceptical of just how effective it will be in protecting the interests of

Reservists into the future.



Labor will be following this issue with interest and I would welcome any feedback on this.



Finally, these are interesting times for the Defence Reserves and there are opportunities

ahead in the new strategic environment.



Recent experience shows we have made significant progress towards achieving a more

integrated ADF, but some crucial challenges remain, which I have outlined.



Whatever we decide to do as a nation, in considering force design and planning and

investment for the future, it is vitally important to ensure the capabilities, skills and

requirements of a well-resourced Defence Reserve are taken into account.



In closing, thank you again for the opportunity to speak to you today.



I look forward to working with the DRA and continuing the discussion so that together we

can deliver better outcomes for our Defence Reservists and bring out their best.



My door is always open.



On behalf of the Opposition, I want to take this opportunity to thank all of you who have

served, and who continue to give of their time to serve.



In particular, I would like to acknowledge the outstanding assistance provided by

Reservists during the bushfire season and during the current pandemic.



They are a crucial element of the ADF and the wider community, and stand for everything

that is good about our country.



I want to assure you that Labor has your back and we will always fight for a fair go for our

Reservists.



We will play a constructive role in Opposition and work as closely as we can to ensure

bipartisanship in policy development.



I look forward to your feedback and will value your contribution to policy development

going forward.



To that end, I’m happy to answer any questions that DRA members may have after the

conclusion of the conference.





Thank you.
