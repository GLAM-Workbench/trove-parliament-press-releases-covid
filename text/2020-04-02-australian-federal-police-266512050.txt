An associate of the WA Comanchero Outlaw Motorcycle Gang has been jailed and  declared a drug trafficker after admitting to dealing MDMA estimated to be worth  about $650,000.

The 23-year-old High Wycombe man was sentenced in the Perth District Court last  week (Thursday 26 March) to 12 years’ imprisonment, after earlier pleading guilty to  possessing MDMA with intent to sell or supply and possession of unlawfully obtained  property (cash).

The Western Australia National Anti-Gangs Squad (WA NAGS) arrested the man in  April 2019 as part of investigation into an alleged MDMA drug dealing syndicate  suspected to be closely linked to the Comanchero OMCG.

The 23-year-old was charged after WA NAGS investigators arrested him with seven  ounces of ecstasy (MDMA).

WA NAGS and the Western Australia Police Force Gang Response Team then executed  a search warrant at his family home in High Wycombe, where they found:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ seven kilograms of MDMA in the form of pills and powder, separated into  kilogram, half kilogram and ounce quantities;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ five new  encrypted mobile telephones and five new SIM cards;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ a vacuum sealing machine and packaging;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $3,900 cash.

When the 23-year-old was sentenced, he was declared a drug trafficker, automatically  forfeiting his assets to the State of WA.

He will be eligible for parole in April 2028.

WA NAGS, which includes members of the Australian Federal Police and Western  Australia Police Force, targets Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (OMCGs) involved in moving  illicit drugs into Australia.

The COVID-19 pandemic will not stop the AFP’s work with its law enforcement  partners to disrupt organised crime and the supply and distribution of illegal drugs in  the Australian community.
