Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment available to Canberra workers

Canberrans who can’t earn an income because they’ve been asked to self-isolate or quarantine may  now be eligible for the $1500 Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment.

Following agreement with the ACT Government, workers in Canberra can now access the Pandemic  Leave Disaster Payment arrangements already in place with Victoria, South Australia, New South  Wales, Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland.

To date, more than $17.6 million has been paid in Pandemic Leave Disaster Payments, with over  11,700 claims granted nationwide since 6 August.

As is the case in other states, workers in the ACT won’t be eligible for the payment if they are  receiving income, earnings or salary maintenance from work, receiving JobKeeper Payment or other  forms of Federal or state government income support.

A person may be eligible for the $1500 payment if they:  Ã¯ÂÂ· have been instructed to self-isolate or quarantine, or   Ã¯ÂÂ· are caring for someone with COVID-19;  Ã¯ÂÂ· they’re a parent or guardian of a child aged 16 or under who has been instructed to self-isolate,

and

Ã¯ÂÂ· they have used all appropriate leave entitlements, including any special pandemic leave.

The payment can be claimed again if health officials should extend the self-isolation or quarantine  period longer than 14 days.

The fastest and easiest way to make a claim is over the phone by calling 180 22 66.
