Trio arrested in connection to one tonne meth  shipment

Saturday, 25 July 2020, Publish time: 7:41am   This is a joint media release between the Australian Federal Police, New South Wales Police Force and  Australian Border Force.

Three men have been arrested in Brisbane and charged for their alleged roles in a criminal conspiracy  to import approximately one tonne of methamphetamine into Australia.

A yacht carrying the methamphetamine was intercepted off the New South Wales coast near Lake  Macquarie on Saturday, 18 April 2020, as part of the multi-agency Operation ROMANI.

The investigation comprised the Australian Federal Police (AFP), New South Wales Police Force  (NSWPF) and Australian Border Force (ABF), collaborating with agencies from the United Kingdom and  New Caledonia.

Details of that activity and footage can be found here.

This investigation began when New Caledonian authorities advised the AFP’s International Command  and the ABF about the arrival of a vessel of interest into Pacific waters the previous day. The vessel was  a yacht crewed by three men.

It will be alleged the vessel had been in waters near Norfolk Island and then had travelled to New  Caledonia. The crew declared to New Caledonian authorities they had travelled from Mexico.

As a result of this information, the Australian investigative team identified a second vessel of interest -  a yacht known as the La Fayette. It will be alleged in court that the La Fayette was loaded with border  controlled drugs from the yacht in waters around Norfolk Island.

The La Fayette then sailed toward Australia before being intercepted by the NSW Police Force Marine  Area Command vessel NEMSIS, with two crew members charged with importing the  methamphetamine.

The three alleged crew members of the vessel that met the La Fayette in waters off Norfolk Island - a  37-year-old and a 53-year-old from the United Kingdom and a 30-year-old United States national -  were arrested in Brisbane yesterday (24 July 2020).

AFP and NSW Police Force Organised Crime Squad investigators charged them each with one count of  attempting to import a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, namely methamphetamine,  contrary to section 307.1(1) by virtue of section 11.1(1) of the of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The  maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment.

It will be alleged in court that the three men were responsible for delivering the methamphetamine  from Mexico to the crew of the La Fayette for importation into Australia.

They are schedule to appear before Brisbane Magistrates Court on Saturday, 25 July 2020.

AFP Eastern Command Commander Investigations Kirsty Schofield said despite the COVID-19 pandemic  Australian authorities and our global law enforcement partners have continued to double down on  organised crime and combat the movement of illicit drugs across international borders.

“This operation has delivered a significant blow to organised criminal groups attempting to operate in  Australia. These arrests should serve as yet another warning to these syndicates attempting to import drugs

and harm our communities, despite COVID-19, we’re not only onto you, we are two steps ahead of you,” she  said.

ABF Regional Investigations NSW Superintendent Garry Low said the ABF continues to work closely  with its law enforcement partners in Australia and overseas to ensure drugs aren’t being smuggling  into the country.

“Regardless of how criminal syndicates try to bring illicit substances into Australia, whether it’s through  our airports, international mail or by sea, ABF officers will find them,” Superintendent Low said.

“Every day, the ABF detects drugs when they reach our shores, but officers also have an eye on  criminals and their products before they even reach Australia.”

NSW Police Force Organised Crime Squad Commander, Detective Superintendent Martin Fileman,  commended the combined efforts of law enforcement across Australia in targeting this criminal  enterprise.

“NSW Police, together with our partner agencies, have united to combat this syndicate involved in the  alleged importation of illicit drugs, and who had every intention of supplying these harmful substances  into the community,” Det Supt Fileman said.
