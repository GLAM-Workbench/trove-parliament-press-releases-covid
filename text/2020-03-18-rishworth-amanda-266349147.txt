GOVERNMENT MUST PROVIDE CLARITY TO FAMILIES AND EARLY  LEARNING PROVIDERS

Labor has today written to the Government to urgently provide clarity and  advice to Australian families and early learning providers during this difficult and  uncertain period.

Whilst Labor understands the circumstances surrounding COVID-19 are rapidly  evolving, the Government must address the increasing anxiety in the  community and early education and care sector regarding potential flow on  effects.

There are a number of legitimate concerns being raised by both families and  the sector, in particular:-

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ In the event that a child has to self-isolate, under current child care  subsidy arrangements the family will still be required to pay fees. This  will be a substantial financial burden for families, during a time when  many parents face the prospect of not working and potentially not  receiving income.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If early learning centres are required to waive fees in the event that a  child has to self-isolate or an entire centre is temporarily closed, this will  have a devastating impact on providers. These providers will lose all  revenue and still be expected to pay the salaries and wages of staff.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It has been made clear by providers that the Government’s  announcement that providers can receive $10,000 cash grants from the  Community Child Care Fund is insufficient, as monthly staff payrolls  alone are many times greater than this amount.

It is vital that the Morrison Government urgently intervenes to provide certainty,  ensure families are not worse off and ensure the sector remains viable during



this challenging time.
