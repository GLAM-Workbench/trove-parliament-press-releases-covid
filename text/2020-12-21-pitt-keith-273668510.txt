RESOURCES AND ENERGY EXPORTS REMAIN ROBUST

The outlook for Australia’s resource and energy exports has improved over the past three  months, as global economic activity rebounds from the COVID-19 pandemic, with resources and  energy exports to remain robust after earning a record $291 billion in 2019-20.

The December Resources and Energy Quarterly forecasts resources and energy exports will earn  $279 billion for Australia in 2020-21, and $264 billion in 2021-22, up by $22 billion and $12  billion respectively from the September quarter forecasts, with improved global economic  activity set to drive even stronger demand.

Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia Keith Pitt said the figures, compiled by  the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, underlined the resilience of  Australia’s resources sector, with record forecasts for iron ore and gold offsetting lower returns  for coal and LNG.

“The diversity of Australian commodities and the investment in technology and innovation over  the past 20 years helped producers and exporters overcome the challenging conditions of the  past year and made sure Australia remained a reliable source of resources and energy,”  Minister Pitt said.

“Australia now stands ready to help supply our export partners as they rebound from the global  economic downturn caused by COVID-19, with the development and rollout of effective  vaccines contributing to global optimism.

“Australia’s success in reaching new markets is an important part of our future success.

“The Coalition Government remains focused on pursuing new investment in the sector and new  export markets, which will boost incomes and jobs in Australia’s towns and regions, and  contribute to the prosperity of all Australians.”

The December Resources and Energy Quarterly shows iron ore export earnings are set to reach  an all-time high of $123 billion in 2020-21, as strong demand from China and supply problems  in Brazil keep prices at high levels.

Australia’s gold exports are on track to set a new record of about $30 billion in 2020-21,  making gold Australia’s third largest commodity export behind iron ore and LNG.

The demand for base metals is also expected to rise, as world industrial activity recovers from  the pandemic. Output and consumption are expected to grow for lithium, copper, nickel and  zinc, which are all important to supporting renewable energy, electric vehicles and batteries.

Coal exports have been hit by uncertainty surrounding coal exports to China and a COVID-19  induced slowdown in the steel industry. The value of metallurgical coal exports, used in steel  making, is forecast to fall to $22 billion in 2020-21 from $34 billion in 2019-20, before  recovering partially to $27 billion in 2021-22.

Earnings from thermal coal exports, used mainly for electricity generation, are forecast to fall  from $20 billion in 2019-20 to $15 billion in 2020-21 before rising slightly to $16 billion in 2021-22.

Australian LNG export earnings are forecast to fall from $48 billion in 2019-20 to $31 billion in  2020-21 due to weaker global prices and demand, before a partial recovery to $37 billion in  2021-22.

The latest Resources and Energy Quarterly is available on the Department of Industry, Science,  Energy and Resources website.
