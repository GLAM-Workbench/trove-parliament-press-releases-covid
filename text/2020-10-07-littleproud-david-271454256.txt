BUDGET 2020: THE NATIONALS IN GOVERNMENT DELIVER FOR  REGIONAL AUSTRALIA

The Nationals in Government will continue supporting job-creating, economy-boosting  infrastructure, as part of our Economic Recovery Plan for Australia, rebuilding our economy to  secure regional and rural Australia’s future.

The Nationals in Government are delivering a record $110 billion transport infrastructure program  and $3.5 billion rolling water infrastructure fund to support local jobs and businesses at a time it is  needed most.

Deputy Prime Minister and Federal Leader of The Nationals Michael McCormack said the Budget  delivered on our economic plan for a stronger and more resilient Australia, boosting the economy,  providing water security for regional and rural Australia, meeting our national freight challenge and  getting Australians home sooner and safer.

“The Budget includes new and additional funding in the 2020-21 Budget for projects and initiatives,  supporting more than 30,000 direct and indirect jobs over the life of the projects, to get Australia  back to work and back in business following the pandemic,” the Deputy Prime Minister said.

Minister for Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management David Littleproud said  the Government was boosting farm exports, investment in the agricultural workforce and ensuring  regional Australia could build resilience to drought, floods and bushfires.

“This is a Budget that makes the necessary investments to set regional and rural Australia up to keep  driving the nation’s economic recovery,” Minister Littleproud said.







Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia Keith Pitt said the Budget backed the  resources industry, unlocked Northern Australia’s potential and boosted water security for farmers.

“Our gas-fired recovery plan will deliver more jobs, as we introduce strong reforms to the North  Australia Infrastructure Facility and help farmers lead the recovery effort through a $50 million  extension to the On-Farm Emergency Water Infrastructure Rebate Scheme,” Minister Pitt said.

Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Defence Personnel Darren Chester said The Nationals in  Government were delivering more funding for veterans and our Australian Defence Force.

“We are providing more than $100 million to bolster mental health support for our veterans and  their families, whilst providing Defence with more than $42 billion this financial year - that’s what  The Nationals in Government are able to deliver,” Minister Chester said.

Ends.

Through the Budget, the Australian Government is investing $17.4 million in relocation assistance  and $16.3 million to incentivise young Australians to take up farm work by temporarily changing  Youth Allowance (student) and ABSTUDY independence eligibility criteria.

The Australian Government is also committed to supporting communities impacted by the 2019  North Queensland floods and the ongoing drought.

The Government is investing $155.6 million over four years to support drought and flood-impacted  communities. This includes:

Ã¯ÂÂ· $50.0 million in 2020-21 to extend the On-farm Emergency Water Infrastructure Rebate  Scheme,   Ã¯ÂÂ· $19.6 million in 2021-22 to extend the drought function of the National Drought and North  Queensland Flood Response and Recovery Agency for a further year to continue

THE RESOURCES PORTFOLIO

As part of our gas-fired recovery plan, the 2020-21 Budget includes $28.3 million to develop five  Strategic Basin Plans which will unlock and accelerate the development of vast gas reserves, increase  domestic supply and lower prices for households and businesses.

The Budget also includes $124.5 million to fund an expanded Exploring for the Future Program.

The program, operated by Geoscience Australia, will deliver detailed data on potential resources in  vast areas that have yet to be fully explored. This funding will help unlock new resources along two  major corridors identified as resource-rich in both western and eastern parts of Australia generating  new job and economic opportunities.

In addition, the Government is providing $13.7 million over four years to provide quality assured  scientific research and information to communities living in gas development regions through the  CSIRO’s Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance.

THE NORTHERN AUSTRALIA PORTFOLIO

Reforms to the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) will ensure the $5 billion facility will  have more flexibility to bankroll investment in a wider range of projects across northern Australia,  and will speed up investment approvals. This comes on top of July’s announcement of a five-year  extension to the NAIF until 30 June 2026.

The Coalition Government is committed to creating jobs across northern Australia to help the region  play a stronger role in Australia’s economic recovery.

We are empowering the NAIF to accelerate lending and providing greater flexibility in how it can  support projects driving economic and population growth - during the challenging business  environment due to COVID-19.

The Budget also includes funding for measures announced in August in the Murray-Darling  Communities Investment Package that will build trust and transparency, as well as improve the  health of the rivers and Basin communities.

The package puts communities and jobs at the heart of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan while also  delivering for the environment and agriculture.
