Help for the Child Care sector and parents



The Minister for Agriculture Drought and Emergency Management, David Littleproud has  welcomed the Federal Government’s Early Childhood Education and Care Relief package  announced today.

Minister Littleproud said we want to keep as many of the sectors 13,000 child care and  early learning services as possible to stay open, especially those in regional Australia.

“This is so their businesses survive, their workers have jobs and parents have the peace of  mind that they too can go to work knowing their children are safe,” Minister Littleproud  said.

“This has been an uncertain time for the sector with enrolment and attendance heading  south with the COVID-19 crisis.

“The relief package will mean the child care sector can offer their services for free when  used in conjunction with the JobKeeper payment.

“For those on the frontline in country towns, they now have the comfort in knowing that  their children will be cared for when they go to work.

“It’s important that nurses, ambos and police can continue to keep their community safe  and well.

“We need to support as many jobs as possible in rural and regional Australia so their  economies keep going.

“This relief package part of the Government’s strategy to save lives and livelihoods and is  another section of the bridge that will take us to the other side of this crisis.
