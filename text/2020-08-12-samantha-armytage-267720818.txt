SAMANTHA ARMYTAGE

The Deputy Prime Minister is joining us now from Darwin, Michael McCormack, good morning to  you.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Good morning, Sam.

SAMANTHA ARMYTAGE

It seems that the Federal Government did offer the ADF to Victoria so why would Daniel Andrews  say otherwise?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, that’s a matter for Daniel Andrews and that question would have to be put to him. I appreciate  that it was put to him in a Parliamentary Inquiry yesterday and he answered the way that he did. But  rest assured that the ADF was always there, ready and available to help the Victorian Government in  any which way, in any capacity that the Victorian Government saw fit, or in any way in which  logistics were able to be organised. I know just yesterday, 1,743 Australia Defence Force Personnel  were in Victoria helping that state.













SAMANTHA ARMYTAGE

Okay, so if private security can’t be trusted should all hotel quarantine around the country be using  the ADF? I know my sister is in hotel quarantine in Sydney right now and the Army is on every floor  of the hotel. So the Army is being used in Sydney and it has been a terrific success. Should all hotel  quarantine around the country be using the ADF?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

It is a matter for the States of course, but we stand ready to make sure that if the States request and  require Australian Defence Force personnel to help out with quarantine arrangements, we will  provide that. We have tens of thousands of ADF people that are qualified and rest assured, that  when somebody sees one of those uniforms, they know that the quarantine is serious stuff. They  have that integrity about the uniform that is so important in this whole situation, Sam.

SAMANTHA ARMYTAGE

Too right. Over the past week, 101 Victorians have died from COVID-19. The worst is apparently yet  to come. More people in aged care are likely to pass away. The statistics we are being given today  are horrendous. Is there anything that can be now done to accelerate the help into aged care,  particularly in Victoria?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, I know the Aged Care Minister Richard Colbeck and the Health Minister Greg Hunt are doing  everything they can with the agencies, with the Departments and with the aged care centres  themselves. This is a very, very sad and tragic situation and we are making sure that every effort is  made to get Victoria and get the nation indeed, through this situation, Sam.

SAMANTHA ARMYTAGE

Michael McCormack, thank you.
