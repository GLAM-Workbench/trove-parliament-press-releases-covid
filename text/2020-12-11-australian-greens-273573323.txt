MEDIA RELEASE COVID-19 Vaccines

Health approach must be priority for rollout of vaccines

The Greens are calling on the Government to clearly articulate plans for the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations.

â€œWe acknowledge there is a significant amount of work that needs to be undertaken in rolling out COVID-19 vaccines", Senator Rachel Siewert, the Australian Greens spokesperson on Health said.

"It is critical that the Government's primary goal for vaccine implementation is the protection of the health system. We need to prioritise older Australians, health care workers, essential workers, First Nations peoples and vulnerable Australians."

"We know that different vaccinations require different infrastructure, we need to be ready to roll out vaccinations promptly and the Government has so far failed to demonstrate that they have a roadmap on how they will do this."

"This is a global health issue, Australia needs to look beyond its borders and take a region-wide approach in supporting our pacific neighbours with vaccine rollout."
