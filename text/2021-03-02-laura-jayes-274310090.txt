INTERVIEW WITH LAURA JAYES, SKY NEWS AM AGENDA

Topics: Aged Care Royal Commission Final Report, Vaccine Rollout  .

E&OE…

Laura Jayes:

I want to bring in now Richard Colbeck. He’s the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged  Care Services. Before I get to the Royal Commission, I’m after your reaction to that story  there. There seems a direct link between an increase in the JobSeeker payments in the midst  of the pandemic and an increase in gambling, domestic violence, and alcohol abuse,  particularly in the Northern Territory, but right across Australia. Is this an unintended  consequence that your Government failed to take into account?

Richard Colbeck:

Look, it’s clearly a concern. This is the first report that I’ve seen of it, but obviously, it’s  those sorts of things that we have to consider when we’re looking at what payments we’re  making to Australians and how that should be managed. So, clearly a concern and potentially  an unintended consequence.

Laura Jayes:

Is this always the danger in rolling out stimulus when you have these economic and health  shocks that you’re always going to have these unintended consequences? I mean, we saw it  during the GFC, didn’t we?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, look, it's important that the Government did what it needed to do to support the  community and the economy during COVID, and we made some very conscious decisions in  relation to that. It had to be done quickly. It had to be done broadly. And I think that the

overall benefits of what we did well and truly outweigh any other consequences, and we've  seen that more broadly across the economy. But it just goes to show how careful you need to  be when you're making these broader considerations, including the decisions that we made  last week with respect to what social support levels should be.

Laura Jayes:

So does that say really, with these unintended consequences, that the Government wasn't  careful enough then?

Richard Colbeck:

No. We had to make some very, very quick decisions to make sure that the national economy  more broadly and the community was supported. We did that. We needed to do that. And as  I've said, I think that the benefits well and truly outweigh any other circumstances that have  arisen. We've seen a very strong recovery in the economy. We saw strong saving levels  across the economy from Australians more broadly. We've seen some elements of the  economy do exceptionally well through COVID-19, and that's because of the measures that  we put in place. But of course, we also need to be aware of other elements that might occur as  a part of those decisions, and it appears, based on the reports that you've just shown, that this  may be one.

Laura Jayes:

Okay. We'll pursue that as well, but let's get to the Aged Care Royal Commission. You’ve  been in government for eight years. What has this Government fixed?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, I mean, the royal commission report talks about successive governments of all political  persuasions over a long period of time, basically kicking cans down the road. It's time to pick  those cans up. It's time for fundamental reform. That's why Prime Minister Morrison called  the royal commission [audio skip] as one of his first acts on coming to the leadership. We've  had two years now of royal commission considering the issues, we received the  recommendations last week - released obviously yesterday, along with an initial package to  demonstrate our attention to some of the initial issues that we need to address. And, of  course, we’ll more fully respond to the Royal Commission in the budget, and we've already  said that we'll accept the Royal Commission's request for a response to Parliament by the end  of May. So, there is a series of actions that have already commenced, starting with the 450  odd million dollars that we announced yesterday across the five pillars of the royal  commission response.

Laura Jayes:

But back to my question. You have been in government for eight years. The Royal  commission says this really started- the problem started in earnest back when John Howard

was the Prime Minister. So there is a huge responsibility for your government, is there not?  What have you fixed in the last eight years, or do you concede it's just got worse?

Richard Colbeck:

No, I don't concede it's got worse. In fact, we've had a considerable measure of reform that's  being undertaken while the Royal Commission continued. The Royal Commission said at the  outset that they didn't want to see- have to conduct a royal commission in moving target, but  there were some things that needed to be done. So, in the last two years, for example, so since  2000- mid-2019, we've introduced new resident centred quality standards for the aged care  sector. We've introduced an aged care charter of rights. We've put in place new regulations  around medication management, and there'll be new regulations from the 1st of July because  we made a commitment when the regs came in for medical constraint- a restraint, that we'd  review those regulations. We've done that. And that we put a sunset clause on the regulations,  meaning that we'll have to revise them by the 1st of July this year. All that work continues.

Laura Jayes:

[Talks over] Minister, all that said and that work done, I mean, it's done nothing, has it?  Because one in three people is still receiving substandard care with all these reforms that you  list off.

Richard Colbeck:

Well, I don't accept it’s done nothing because we know, for example- and we're now looking  to measure that with respect to medical restraint and physical restraint. So we have a physical  restraint quality indicator that's been measured since 2019. As of the 1st of July this year,  we’ll have a medication quality indicator that we'll be putting in place. So we've continued to  reform. We've continued to change the way that the system operates. But what the Royal  Commission has said to us, now, it's time for a more fundamental and generational change in  the way that the system operates. We’re looking very closely at that.

Laura Jayes:

[Talks over] And you didn't know that before? You didn't know that before this royal  commission? You didn't know that generational reform was required, a fundamental shift?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, clearly, as the Royal Commission’s commenced, we've been watching it closely. We  looked at the counsel assisting’s draft recommendations to the commissioners that were  released in October last year. They formed part of our thinking with respect to our response  to the Royal Commission. But having called the Royal Commission, which the Prime  Minister did as one of his first acts, I think it was incumbent on us to understand exactly what  the commissioners were going to say. They provided that report to us on Friday. We've now  commenced our intense consideration of those recommendations, and there are some  decisions for us to make, given that there are different recommendations from the

Media inquiries | Aaron Langmaid | 0456 889 018  Authorised by Senator Richard Colbeck, Tasmania





commissioners with respect to some aspects of the reform. And then, the task is to commence  the implementation process.

And the Prime Minister’s committed to doing that. I think that’s appropriate. We set in place  a process to have a forensic review of the entire aged care system. We’ve done that. We’ve  received the report. And now it’s our responsibility to implement the reforms that are  required off the back of that.

Laura Jayes:

Okay. But what- but in the meantime, what do you suggest happens to the one in three  Australians that are receiving substandard care? Do they just put up with it?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, of course, they shouldn’t and the expectation from all of us is that the sector provides  high quality care. There are reforms required to do that, a number of reforms that the Royal  Commission…

Laura Jayes:

[Talks over] So when do things change, Minister? When do things change?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, they will commence changing straight away because we continue to reform the sector.  But as the Royal Commission stated, this is not a simple process. It won’t take a short period  of time. And there are a number of things that we need to put in place to give effect to those  reforms. They themselves will take some time…

Laura Jayes:

[Talks over] Okay. But there’s many elderly Australians watching-

Richard Colbeck:

…including a new Aged Care Act which we’ve committed to do. So, [indistinct]-

Laura Jayes:

[Talks over] Okay. But there’s many elderly Australians watching today, and watching this  program who have got grandparents or parents in aged care. They’re hearing these reports  and they’ve seen it upfront, of spending hours in soiled underwear, going days without  showers, being forgotten when it comes to food service. What do they do in the meantime?  Are the just going to have to put up with that?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, we continue to do- to implement the reforms that A) that we’ve commenced, and B)  that have been recommended by the Royal Commission. So, as I’ve said, we haven’t sat idle

Media inquiries | Aaron Langmaid | 0456 889 018  Authorised by Senator Richard Colbeck, Tasmania





while the Royal Commission has been going through its process. We’ve continued to reform  a new set of quality of standards. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission didn’t exist  before the Royal Commission started. That organisation has-

Laura Jayes:

[Talks over] Sure. But Minister, I want to get to this on a human level.

Richard Colbeck:

[Interrupts] Well-

Laura Jayes:

I want to talk about, you know, we’re talking about aged care centres now. I mean, on a  human level, are you comfortable sitting here knowing that all those things that I just listed  off are going on today in aged care homes, and that, as of today, has not changed? When will  it?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, no, I'm not comfortable, Laura. In fact, I've become increasingly frustrated and  concerned at the continued reports that come out of the sector. It really does distress me, like  it distresses family members. But that's why I'm determined to undertake the reforms that  have come out of this comprehensive process. That's why the Prime Minister called the Royal  Commission in the first place, because he wasn't getting the answers that he wanted when he  asked the questions about the sector. And so it is now our responsibility to get on with those  reforms. It's not an overnight exercise. Just because we’ve received the report, doesn't mean  things change immediately. And there’s-

Laura Jayes:

[Interrupts] Well, no, it's a big shift to turn around and you've committed, as a down payment,  $452 million. The sector, according to the report, is underfunded by- to the tune of about $10  billion a year. That's a long way. That's a big gap to fill. I mean, are we going to see $10  billion a year spent in the budget? Because that's what's required.

Richard Colbeck:

Well, you'll see what's required to be spent in the budget, but one of the measures that we  announced yesterday was a continuation of increased funding to the aged care sector. But one  of the other things the Royal Commission has said and a number of experts have said as part  of that process, that we shouldn't be just giving money to the sector without accountability. I  agree with that. We need to put that accountability in place and rules. But to do that, we need  to build the systems to do it, and we will do that. And those things are all going to be  important. So the underpinning of the sector with appropriate levels of funding, staffing,  training for it, for workforce, all of those things are going to have to be put in place. Some of  them are going to take some time. The Royal Commission talked about a five-year

Media inquiries | Aaron Langmaid | 0456 889 018  Authorised by Senator Richard Colbeck, Tasmania





timeframe, but some things can be done more quickly. And we will continue with the reforms  like, for example, the serious incident response scheme that starts in- just in one month, so 1st  of April, which we legislated over Christmas.

Laura Jayes:

Would you put your elderly relatives in an aged care home, at the moment?

Richard Colbeck:

I have elderly relatives in aged care facilities at the moment, Laura, and fortunately, they're  having a good experience. The tragic thing is that for some people, the experience is not a  good experience. There are a lot of Australians who are getting a good experience in  residential aged care, in particular in the country. But there are those and that's been  highlighted by the Royal Commission that are not and that's not acceptable. We need to  change that. And that's the point of the Prime Minister calling the Royal Commission in the  first place, to get the answers that he wasn't getting, and then to implement the reforms that  will turn that around.

Laura Jayes:

But can you say when? Months, years? When will it be fixed?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, Laura, as I've said to you, we have been continuing to reform the sector to improve…

Laura Jayes:

[Talks over] You’ve had eight years, Minister.

Richard Colbeck:

…the delivery of care while the royal commission situation has been going well.

Laura Jayes:

Forgive my cynicism.

Richard Colbeck:

Well, I can understand your cynicism because when we continue to hear reports of poor  quality care, it exacerbates that cynicism and it distresses all of us, it really does. But we  need- but it's not going to be an overnight exercise. It would be irresponsible of me to  promise that it will be. But we will continue to put in place reforms, to continue to improve  the sector and particularly, a significant response to the Royal Commission's report in the  budget in a few weeks’ time.

Laura Jayes:

And just finally, look, you've been in power for eight years, but you haven't always been the  Aged Care Minister, but you are the Aged Care Minister at the moment. But we've failed  elderly people again this week. Homes, aged care homes haven't been administered all the  vaccines that's required. That's according to the New South Wales at least and some of the  other states. And last week, two elderly residents were given overdoses of the vaccine. It's  another example, isn't it, of us not doing the right thing by our elderly Australians?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, the incident that occurred in Queensland was unacceptable, and I wouldn't blame that  on the aged care sector, that was a doctor who didn't undertake the training that he should  have undertaken before administering the vaccine. It should not have happened. And so that  indicates a broader problem within the system more generally. But I wouldn't blame that on  the aged care system. And similarly, the vaccine rollout is being undertaken and in some  states it's well ahead of schedule. In some states that we're having some issues and working to  bring that back into line and we’re expecting that by the end of this week, we'll be back on  program to complete the rollout in six weeks. But we're in a very fortunate position in this  country, Laura. We don't have COVID in the community. We're able to properly and  methodically rollout and scale up the vaccination process across the country and make sure  that we do it properly because we don't want more incidents like occurred in Queensland last  week, occurring. There will be some logistical issues and some bumps along the way in the  rollout. That's just natural. That's a human part of the process. But we will continue to do  everything we can to rollout the vaccination and gradually scale it up as more vaccine  becomes available. And as I said, in some states, the vaccine rollout in aged care is actually  ahead of schedule. We're having some issues in certain locations around the country. We will  overcome those and we will get the vaccination rollout completed to aged care facilities,  protecting those who are most vulnerable first.

Laura Jayes:

Okay, Richard Colbeck, really appreciate your time as always. We'll talk again soon.

Richard Colbeck:

Thanks, Laura.
