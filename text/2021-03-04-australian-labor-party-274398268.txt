QANTAS AGAIN HIGHLIGHTS NEED FOR AVIATION PLAN



Evidence from Qantas that there may be more aviation job losses to come has once again

highlighted the urgent need for the Morrison Government to provide ongoing support to this

essential sector.



Speaking at the Senate Inquiry into the Future of Aviation, Qantas pointed to ongoing

uncertainty regarding domestic and international travel as posing a risk to the airline and even

more Australian jobs.



With no guarantees that Australia has seen its last COVID outbreak, leaving the essential

aviation sector without ongoing support is negligent.



Throughout the pandemic Qantas has already cut 8,500 workers, along with thousand of

further job losses at Virgin Australia and across the sector.



When JobKeeper is removed this month, the Morrison Government will be leaving aviation on

its own.



The Morrison Government’s shambolic response to COVID’s impacts on aviation has seen

them deny JobKeeper to workers at Dnata and council owned airports, abandon Virgin

Australia to administration and stand idly by as Qantas sacked thousands of workers.





If they now pretend this crisis is over they will be responsible for even more job losses.



The Government needs to get off their hands, listen to the sector and finally come up with a

plan for aviation.
