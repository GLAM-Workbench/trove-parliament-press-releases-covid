GOVERNMENT LAUNCHES NEW COVID-19   MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS IN VICTORIA

From Monday 14 September 2020, Victorians will have access to additional mental health  support with 15 new dedicated mental health clinics opening to the public.

The clinics, announced on 17 August as part of a $31.9 million federal government mental  health package to support Victorians during the COVID-19 pandemic, have been rapidly  rolled out across the state at a cost of $26.9 million.

There will be nine HeadtoHelp clinics located in Greater Melbourne and six in regional  Victoria. The locations are:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Greater Melbourne: Berwick, Frankston, Officer, Hawthorn, Yarra Junction, West  Heidelberg, Broadmeadows, Wyndham Vale, Brunswick East   Ã¯ÂÂ· Regional Victoria: Warragul, Sale, Bendigo, Wodonga, Sebastopol and Norlane.

Our Government recognises that the ongoing restrictions are having a significant impact on  the wellbeing and mental health of individuals and communities in Victoria, and is committed  to ensuring that support is available.

These new clinics, branded with the HeadtoHelp logo, are a free service and, over the next 12  months, will provide a place within the community for people to access mental health care as  early and as conveniently as possible.

The clinics are staffed by multi-disciplinary teams of mental health professionals which may  include GPs, mental health nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and/or other  allied health workers.

The HeadtoHelp clinics will provide on-site mental health support, and will also connect to  other mental health services in their region, including intensive mental health care or social  supports, to ensure people get the help they need when they need it.

The clinics will play a key role in supporting our GPs, emergency departments, and hospitals  by providing easily accessible mental health care.

The rapid establishment of the clinics has been overseen by a joint federal and state Mental  Health Pandemic Response Taskforce co-chaired by Dr Ruth Vine, the Australian  Government Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Mental Health, and Pam Anders, CEO Mental  Health Reform Victoria.

Authorised by Greg Hunt MP, Liberal Party of Australia, Somerville, Victoria.

This collaboration between the Commonwealth and Victorian governments is ensuring that  the new clinics will be integrated with local services and will support other enhancements to  Victoria’s mental health system.

The clinics are being delivered by the Commonwealth Government’s Primary Health  Networks (PHNs) which play a critical role in commissioning mental health services at a  regional level.

In addition to the clinics, $5 million in funding is being provided to enhance existing digital  and phone services for specific groups that are experiencing significant challenges during the  restrictions in Victoria.

These services providers include The Butterfly Foundation, Eating Disorders Families  Australia (EDFA), Q-Life, Perinatal Anxiety & Depression Australia (PANDA), and  Victorian Aboriginal Health Service (VAHS) Yarning SafeNStrong helpline.

This new support builds on the more than $500 million additional funding provided by our  Government for mental health and suicide prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic,  including 10 additional Medicare subsidised psychological therapy sessions for people subject  to further restrictions.

We continue to demonstrate our firm commitment to the mental health and wellbeing of all  Australians, with estimated annual federal expenditure on mental health services and suicide  prevention estimated to be a record of $5.7 billion in 2020-21 alone.

Anyone concerned about their mental health can visit these clinics in person or call 1800 595  212 to talk to a health professional or connect to a service near them.

More information on how to access the HeadtoHelp clinics and additional digital supports can  also be found at health.gov.au/resources or headtohelp.org.au.
