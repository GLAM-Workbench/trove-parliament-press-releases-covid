TIME FOR MORRISON TO CALL OUT PREFERENCE BUDDY CLIVE’S

VACCINE MISINFORMATION



Clive Palmer is now taking out full page ads in national newspapers questioning the safety of

Australia’s TGA-approved COVID-19 vaccines.



Australia’s TGA is one of, if not the best medical regulator in the world.



They have gone through their proper processes to approve the vaccines and Labor supports

their work.



Morrison and Hunt refused to call Craig Kelly out publicly for his spreading of medical

misinformation, so he sacked himself.



Now their preference buddy Clive Palmer is trying to undermine the most important public

health effort in Australian history - but there’s been no comment from Morrison or Hunt.



In his full page ad, Palmer makes absurd and baseless claims about vaccines not complying

with the law.



No one should be taking health advice from Clive Palmer.



This is the same Clive Palmer who previously took out full page ads to spruik baseless claims



about the debunked COVID-19 treatment, hydroxychloroquine.



Australian taxpayers are spending over $20 million for a vaccine information campaign.



Australia’s top health bureaucrats have talked consistently about the growing challenge of

combatting health misinformation.



Our TGA boss John Skerritt has even said that ‘any regulator would like the support of their

elected representatives’.



Public confidence in vaccines is critical to Australia’s recovery from the health and economic

crisis of COVID-19.



This morally bankrupt but cash rich billionaire is doing his best to undermine it.



Will Morrison and Hunt call him out for his misinformation or continue to put Australia’s

recovery second to their billionaire mate?
