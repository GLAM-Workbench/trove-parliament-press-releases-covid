ALBANY JOBS FAIR CONNECTS JOB SEEKERS WITH EMPLOYERS

The employment opportunities in Albany will be on display at a jobs fair to be held this  Friday 5 March 2021.

The Albany Jobs Fair, funded by the Morrison Government, will bring together job seekers  and local businesses in Albany and the surrounding regions.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said many local businesses are looking to hire staff again as the country recovers from  COVID-19.

“The Albany Jobs Fair is a must for locals who want to connect with businesses currently  recruiting,” Minister Cash said.

“As we see COVID-19 restrictions ease, the Morrison Government is committed to  connecting job seekers with businesses looking to hire.

“Creating jobs and boosting Australians’ skills to help them get back into work is at the heart  of our Economic Recovery Plan.

“The Australian Government has held Jobs Fairs in various locations around Australia and  more than 44,000 people have attended these fantastic events since July 2018, both face-to-face and online.

“I encourage job seekers to take advantage of the range of information that will be available  at the event to help them along their employment journey.

“Presentations will be held on a range of topics to help people get a job and assistance with  resume and interview preparation also be available.”

The Albany Jobs Fair is a free event from 9.30 am to 2 pm AWST on Friday 5 March.  Registrations are required for the event and can be made at dese.gov.au/AlbanyJF
