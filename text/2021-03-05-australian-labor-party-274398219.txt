URGENT EXPLANATION NEEDED ON ASTRAZENECA SUPPLY

The Morrison Government must urgently explain what it is doing to ensure supplies of  AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine reach Australia.

Just last month, Greg Hunt assured Australians that “the [European Union] regulatory  steps are not aimed at Australia, and not expected to affect Australia”.

But now, Australia has become the only country in the world to be impacted by the  EU’s export controls.

The situation is concerning because the Therapeutic Goods Administration is yet to  approve the version of the vaccine that CSL is manufacturing in Australia.

The TGA’s experts should take all the time they need to ensure the quality and safety  of the CSL version.

But in the meantime, the Government must ensure that Australians have access to  overseas doses - doses that were meant to arrive in Australia by February.

The Government must also come clean about what it knew about this situation, and  when.

As reported today, Italy lodged its objection last Friday, and AstraZeneca was informed  on Tuesday.

Either the Morrison Government has been in the dark for a week, or it knew but didn’t  tell Australians.

It’s time for Greg Hunt to stop the spin and be honest with Australians about what he  knew, and how he’s resolving this situation.

This Government said 4 million Australians would be vaccinated by the end of March -  they need to get the vaccine rollout back on track.
