AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURING IN NEED OF COMPREHENSIVE PLAN

The Australian manufacturing sector is in critical need of a comprehensive future plan from  the Morrison Government to drive employment and boost GDP as Australia navigates the  deep recession we are in.

Federal Labor welcomes the release today of the AMWU report A Fair Share for Australian  Manufacturing, which outlines a detailed plan for the future of the industry, which is so  critical for encouraging well paid, highly skilled secure jobs.

The AMWU report highlights the critical need for reform of high energy costs, and skills  and training. It explores a plan to deliver, “400,000 new manufacturing jobs, a further  265,000 in supply chains - all of them working together to put that famous Australian Made  label on an extra $180 billion worth of products every year.”

The report stands in stark contrast to the failure of the Morrison Government to outline a  plan for manufacturing in last week’s Budget update.

COVID-19 has demonstrated just how vulnerable Australia is to global supply chain  shocks. The Liberals’ lack of a economic plan is leaving Australia, and the manufacturing  sector, dangerously exposed to turbulence in the global economy.

While some of our manufacturers have adapted to produce much needed Personal  Protective Equipment and other essential suppliers during COVID-19, Australia needs a  more sophisticated manufacturing plan than just responding to crises.

The only plan the Morrison Government currently has is to rip $1.8 billion from research  and development. Research and Development is inextricably linked to a recovery led by  advanced manufacturing, and the manufacturing sector is the second largest spender on  R&D.

As we look to the future and how we best emerge from the health crisis and recession, the



Morrison Government must do more to support the Australian manufacturing sector. A  strong local manufacturing industry will create jobs and long term export and trading  opportunities

They need to come up with a genuine plan to get the economy moving again.
