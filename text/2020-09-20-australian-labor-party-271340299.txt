APPOINTMENTS TO CSIRO BOARD WELCOMED



David Thodey AO has been reappointed to Chairman of the board for 12

months. Professor Edwina Cornish AO has also been reappointed for a further

three years. Quantum physicist Professor Michelle Simmons has been

appointed for five years. Kathryn Fagg AO will become Deputy Chairperson.



These are excellent appointments to the CSIRO Board.



These appointments have a wealth of experience and showcase the

outstanding talent within Australia’s science and research sector.



They come at a time when the importance of listening to science and experts is

pivotal to not only when dealing with the global pandemic, but also as we take

on a number of challenges on the road to recovery and resilience.



The CSIRO board has their work cut out for them, as unfortunately scientists

and evidence are not sufficiently valued by some sections of the Morrison

Government, posing a grave danger for Australia’s future.





Undermining science has taken various forms under Liberals, including cutting

staff at the CSIRO, the very organisation now testing vaccines for the

coronavirus, and sending them to the Centrelink queues.

Listening to and respecting our experts is of the utmost importance, particularly

in response to COVID-19.
