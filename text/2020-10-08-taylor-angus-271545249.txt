ALBANESE LOST IN TRANSMISSION

The Australian Labor Party has today again walked away from its traditional blue-collar  base, choosing to appease inner-city green left voters over the needs of hundreds of  thousands of Australians whose jobs depend on affordable and reliable energy.

Labor’s latest energy policy will see Anthony Albanese hand over $20 billion from  Australian workers to the world’s largest pension and sovereign wealth funds who own  the transmission companies.

The Morrison Government is already supporting all of the priority transmission projects  identified in AEMO’s Integrated System Plan.

Anthony Albanese is trying to play catch up. Yet his scheme won’t deliver a single extra  job while Australia recovers from COVID-19, or a single megawatt of new reliable  generation.

Labor’s Budget-in-reply is notable only for its omissions:  Ã¢ÂÂ No plan for lower energy prices.   Ã¢ÂÂ No plan for gas.  Ã¢ÂÂ No plan for fuel security.  Ã¢ÂÂ No plan to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.

The Morrison Government will continue to deliver practical measures that guarantee  reliable and affordable energy, stimulate job creation and reduce emissions, without  imposing new costs on households, businesses or the economy.

The Government’s investments in energy, fuel security, gas and emissions reduction will  create more than 135,000 new jobs across Australia and drive more than $70 billion of  combined government and private investment as part of our Economic Recovery Plan  for Australia.
