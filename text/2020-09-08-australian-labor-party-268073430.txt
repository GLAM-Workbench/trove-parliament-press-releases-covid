TIME FOR TRANSPARENCY ON AGED CARE

The Morrison Government must be more transparent about older Australians  who have tragically passed away from COVID-19 in aged care homes.

It’s time to end the secrecy and be honest with Australians about which aged  care homes have been impacted by COVID-19, and how many cases and  deaths have occurred at each facility.

The Department of Health has previously tried to defend this secrecy because  of ‘reputational issues’ relating to providers with outbreaks.

The Minister for Health expects transparency from states and territories on  COVID-19 but clearly when it comes to his own Government’s responsibility  with aged care there is a very different standard.

This isn’t good enough - the public have a right to know about the status of  outbreaks of COVID-19 in aged care.

The Morrison Government opposes transparency at every turn.

The Morrison Government has voted against attempts to show where billions of  dollars taxpayers’ money is going in aged care.

The Morrison Government has repeatedly delayed the release of data on the  number of older Australians languishing on the waiting list for home care.

Day after day the evidence mounts of serious neglect in aged care homes and  every day all we see from the Morrison Government is running away, passing  the buck and not accepting responsibility for its own failures.

Neglect. That’s the legacy of this Government when it comes to aged care.



Australians deserve better on aged care- they deserve honesty.
