GOVERNMENT MUST COME CLEAN ON TOURISM FUNDING FOR

BUSHFIRE REGIONS



Tourism businesses in bushfire and coronavirus affected regions have been

thrown into confusion over support promised by the Morrison Government.



Last week reports emerged that the Morrison Government would reallocate $25

million from the $76 million committed to support tourism in bushfire affected

regions, to now fund a campaign in support of tourism businesses impacted by

coronavirus.



These reports were backed by Leichhardt MP Warren Entsch as recently as

today, with his office telling journalists the funding was “part of a wider $76



million national tourism package, aspects of which have already been

announced - bushfire recovery etc”.



But in evidence to Senate Estimates this week, when asked by Senator Watt if

there is still $76 million available to support tourism promotion in bushfire

affected regions, National Bushfire Recovery Coordinator Andrew Colvin said:



“That was the measure. Certainly coronavirus has had a big impact, and now a

double impact, if not a triple impact with other measures, in the tourism

industry, but I’m not aware of funding being diverted from the $76 million, no.”



Minister Zed Seselja also poured cold water over the claim and said: “My

advice is that no bushfire funding has been diverted for coronavirus.”



Scott Morrison must explain how the $25 million campaign announced last

week will be funded, if at all.



The Prime Minister has dropped the ball on supporting a tourism industry

struggling with the impact of coronavirus. He’s either continuing to ignore their

needs, or is plundering much needed funding for regions hit by the bushfires.



He owes it to bushfire victims and tourism businesses to stop the confusing

messages, set the facts straight and clarify how this campaign will be funded.
