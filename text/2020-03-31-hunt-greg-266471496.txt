ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO MEDICINES DURING THE COVID-19  PANDEMIC

The Australian Government has approved a number of temporary changes to medicines  regulation to ensure Australians can continue to access the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme  (PBS) medicines they need, as the COVID-19 outbreak unfolds.

We are also closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on the supply of medicines,  especially those manufactured overseas, so we can take early action to address any potential  supply interruptions.

New temporary measures will improve access to medicines, reduce the burden on GPs and  support social distancing and self-isolation.

The measures include:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Continued dispensing arrangements for the ongoing supply PBS subsidised medicines  without a prescription will be extended to 30 June 2020.

Ã¯ÂÂ· A home delivery service for PBS and Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme  (RPBS) medicines is now in place.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Ongoing work with pharmacists, GPs and the States and Territories to allow medicine  substitution by the pharmacist in the event of a shortage.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Restrictions on the quantity of medicines that can be purchased to prevent unnecessary  medicine stockpiling.

These temporary changes will ensure Australians can access the medicines they need  throughout the coronavirus outbreak.

Continued dispensing  Emergency measures to allow continued access to essential medicines through the PBS will  be extended to 30 June 2020.

These temporary “continued dispensing” arrangements allow people to obtain their usual  medicines at PBS prices, even if they cannot get a new prescription from their doctor.

Under strict conditions, pharmacists will be able to give patients up to one month’s supply of  their usual medicine without a script, at the usual PBS consumer co-payment.

The patient must previously have been prescribed the medicine and the pharmacist must be  satisfied it is urgently needed.

These measures were originally put in place in January in response to the widespread  bushfires and were due to end on 31 March 2020, however will be extended following  consultation with doctors and the community pharmacy sector.

Home Delivery of Medicines  A new Home Medicines Service has been established to provide home delivery of PBS and  Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines, for vulnerable people and people in  isolation.

This will complement the Government’s investments in telehealth, which allow people to see  their doctor remotely, and if necessary obtain a script remotely. Vulnerable people will also  be able to have their scripts filled remotely and delivered to their home.

The Government is fast tracking the roll out of electronic prescribing and dispensing through  medical and dispensing software to make this even easier.

Substitution   The Australian Government is implementing changes to allow community pharmacists to  substitute dose strengths or forms of medicines without prior approval from the prescribing  doctor, if a medicine is unavailable at the time of dispensing.

These changes will relieve pressure on busy doctors and allow patients to receive their  medicines from their pharmacist without delay.

The changes will allow, for example, a pharmacist to dispense different strengths of a product  (such as two 20mg tablets in place of a 40mg tablet), or a different dose form of the same  medicine (such as a capsule instead of a tablet).

The changes will be implemented through the Scheduling Policy Framework and Poisons  Standard, with implementation by States and Territories and the Government through the  TGA. The Australian Government continues to consult on the implementation and the  potential expansion of these substitution measures.

Measures to prevent stockpiling  New measures were also introduced on 19 March to prevent medicines stockpiling.

Pharmacists are required to limit dispensing and sales of certain prescription and over-the-counter medicines to a one-month supply for prescription medicines, and to a maximum of  one unit per purchase of certain over-the-counter non-prescription medicines

Pharmaceutical wholesalers participating in the Community Service Obligation arrangements  are also required to manage the supply of medicines to community pharmacies where there  are significant stock shortages, to ensure equitable distribution of medicines to all Australians.
