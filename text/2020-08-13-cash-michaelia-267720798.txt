LABOUR FORCE FIGURES FOR JULY



Labour force figures released today by the ABS for the month of July demonstrate the  underlying strength of the Australian labour market and show that the easing of COVID-19  restrictions resulted in some improvement in the labour market.

Employment increased by 114,700 (or 0.9 per cent) over the month, exceeding median  market expectations. Full-time employment increased by 43,500 (or 0.5 per cent) and part-time employment rose by 71,200 (or 1.9 per cent).

The effective unemployment rate for July is 9.9 per cent, down from its peak of 14.9 per cent in April.

Encouragingly, female employment increased by 59,500 (or 1.0 per cent) in July, while youth  employment rose by 55,600 (or 3.2 per cent).

While the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose marginally to 7.5 per cent this was  driven by a 0.6 percentage point increase in the participation rate to 64.7 per cent as 130,500  people entered the labour force.



It is important to note that most of the July Labour Force Survey reference period (28 June to  11 July) pre-dates the implementation of Stage 3 and Stage 4 restrictions in Melbourne (on 8  July and 5 August, respectively) that were put in place due to the outbreak of COVID-19  cases.

Despite today’s positive figures, the Government remains acutely aware that the economic  fallout from COVID-19 will continue for some time particularly in light of the outbreak of  cases in Victoria. This is why the Government has moved quickly to protect both the health  and jobs of all Australians and has put in place sustainable measures to help cushion the  impact of the pandemic.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said in order to help keep businesses in business and Australians in jobs, the Morrison  Government committed an initial $70 billion in JobKeeper payments to help support  Australian workers.



“The Government remains cognisant, however, of the need to remain agile and the  importance of responding flexibly to outbreaks of COVID-19, to help mitigate the impact on  the labour market,” Minister Cash said.

“In recognition of the difficulties that businesses and employees are encountering as a result  of the Stage 3 and 4 restrictions in Victoria, as well as the negative economic impact of the  outbreak of COVID-19 in the State, the Government has made changes to JobKeeper  eligibility and is committing a further $15.6 billion over 2020-21 to help keep businesses  afloat and workers in jobs.”

“This builds on the Government’s announcement last month of the $1 billion JobTrainer fund  to help create 340,700 new training places and a further $1.5 billion in support for small and  medium businesses to retain their apprentices.”  Minister Cash said.
