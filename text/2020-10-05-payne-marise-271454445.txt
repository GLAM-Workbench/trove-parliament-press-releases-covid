MEDIA RELEASE

NEW CALEDONIA REFERENDUM OF 4 OCTOBER ON  INDEPENDENCE



Australia congratulates the people of New Caledonia on their second act of self-determination under the Noumea Accord on 4 October 2020.  We recognise the  choice made by New Caledonians to remain a part of France.

We acknowledge the efforts of both the French Government and New Caledonian  leaders to enable the New Caledonian people to determine their own future.

We admire the commitment of all parties to hold the ballot despite the challenges  presented by COVID-19.

Australia is one of New Caledoniaâ€™s closest neighbours, and with this year marking  80 years of diplomatic relations between Australia and New Caledonia, we look  forward to continuing to build a deeper and stronger partnership.

Australia values its close relationship with France as a likeminded partner in the  Indo-Pacific region.  We welcome France's ongoing commitment to the Pacific, and  its significant contribution to regional security and prosperity.
