Celebrating our teachers

Minister for Education Dan Tehan today paid tribute to the outstanding commitment of every  teacher across Australia.

“This year, our teachers have been asked to go even further above and beyond the call of  duty and they did it,” Mr Tehan said.

“On behalf of students, parents, families and the Australian community, I would like to thank  and honour more than 288,000 teachers on World Teachers’ Day in Australia.

“Today we acknowledge our teachers for the resilience, innovation and flexibility they have  demonstrated throughout this year, and every year.

“From bushfires to COVID-19, this has been a school year like no other and our teachers  and school leaders have risen to the challenge.

“I encourage students, parents, families and communities across Australia to say a special  thank you to their teachers and educators today. The future of teaching is certainly bright.”
