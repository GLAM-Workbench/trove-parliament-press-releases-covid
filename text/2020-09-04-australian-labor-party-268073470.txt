US SANCTIONS OF ICC OFFICIALS



Labor objects to the US Administration’s decision to sanction International

Criminal Court officials.



While the world is grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicts and human

rights abuses continue.



The work of the ICC is vital to upholding international law and the multilateral

rules-based order.



The Foreign Minister has prioritised targeting efforts to preserve “norms that

underpin universal human rights, gender equality and the rule of law.”







We urge the Minister to express to her US counterpart that this decision does

not help preserve those norms.



Australia has traditionally been a strong supporter of the Court. The creation of

the Court in 2002 was enthusiastically supported by Prime Minister John

Howard and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer.



Labor calls on the Australian Government to work with aligned nations to

support its important work.
