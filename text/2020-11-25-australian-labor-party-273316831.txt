SENATOR PENNY WONG, SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Good to be

with you, Patricia.



Just before we get to your portfolio, the Home Affairs Minister has confirmed that

the Government has cancelled the citizenship of terrorist Abdul Nacer Benbrika. What is

your reaction to that decision? He's the first person to have his citizenship cancelled under

the laws.



WONG: Well, the laws under which the citizenship has been cancelled are laws which

were passed with Labor's support. In fact, I was on the intelligence committee at the time

that we were dealing with some of those issues. Obviously, my colleague, Senator

Keneally, will be seeking a briefing. I understand from what the Minister said

the Government seeks a continuing detention order for Mr Benbrika, which

the minister averted to in his announcement.



KARVELAS: So Labor supports this move by Peter Dutton. Obviously, this is a pretty

significant issue. Are you concerned at all about the way the Government has handled

this?



WONG: Look, I will leave more detailed comment to my colleague, Senator Keneally. But I

would say that we did understand when we passed those laws through the Parliament that

the cancellation of citizenship was a big step but a necessary step in certain circumstances

and Mr Benbrika's activities and his conviction are well known to all of us. And that is

why Labor supported the passage of that legislation.



KARVELAS: Let's move to a few other issues. What are your concerns around

former Finance Minister Mathias Cormann being given the use of the RAAF jet for his

campaign to become head of the OECD?



WONG: I was somewhat struck by Mr Morrison's double standard today, when defending

the use of the private jet, he said it was because former Senator Cormann might contract

COVID if he used commercial options. I would make the point there are 36,000

Australians who are currently stranded as a result of border closures. They don't get this

sort of treatment, having a RAAF jet. They are required to fly commercial, so I thought that

double standard would be pretty hard to hear for some of those families whose relatives

are in difficult circumstances, stuck outside Australia.



I’d make this point; we have taken the view, a mature view, as an Opposition, that there's a

national interest in having Australians in international institutions. It's a very different view

to the pettiness that we saw when Kevin Rudd's candidacy for the

UN Secretary-General was not supported by the Coalition, including by Senator Cormann.

We think that was the wrong call and we have taken a more mature approach and

indicated we're supportive of his bid. But ultimately, it's for the Government to explain the

costs, the use of the plane, and all the costs associated with this bid.



KARVELAS: You say you took a more mature response, but also that it's double

standards. So, does that mean that, on balance, you accept the Government's

argument that he couldn't use commercial planes because of the risk of COVID-19?



WONG: You know what, I don't accept the fact that the Prime Minister promised to get

36,000 Australians home by Christmas, which he's clearly not going to do, yet another

Scott Morrison announcement which is not being delivered on. I think if the Government

wants to convince Australians that this is value for money, they should simply be

transparent and up-front.



KARVELAS: The argument around COVID-19 being too big a risk, is that fair enough?



WONG: They're not my words.



KARVELAS: I know.



WONG: I think you should be asking Scott Morrison.



KARVELAS: He's not on the show, though, you are.



WONG: Maybe he should be, that would be good, wouldn't it? My point is, if

that is that good enough for Senator Cormann, why is there a different standard being

applied to Australians stranded overseas? I think people want to hear that. There may be

an answer to that and it's an answer the Government should give you.



KARVELAS: Is it in our national interest for an Australian to become the next head of the

OECD?



WONG: Yes, it is. That's why we have taken the decision as I said in answer to you

previously, a decision by an Opposition that shows some maturity and some focus on the

national interest over partisanship to support Mathias Cormann's bid for this position. We

have different views, but it is in our interest. Again, it was disappointing or extraordinary,

actually, that the Abbott opposition opposed Australia's bid for the Security Council. These

are matters that should be beyond domestic partisanship. And we have shown that we're

prepared to do that.



KARVELAS: Is it appropriate for Greens MPs to lobby against Mathias Cormann's

appointment over the Coalition's record on climate change?



WONG: Well, Mr Bandt can explain why and I'm sure there are many Australians who

share my concern and Labor's concern with the behaviour of this Government when it

comes to climate. I think I would rather continue to advocate for a Labor Government that

would deliver action on climate. It's been extraordinary, hasn't it, we've seen a US election

with the most ambitious policy on climate ever put forward by a Presidential candidate, and

that really has served to underline just how isolated Australia is on this. I would say this; if

former Senator Cormann does not succeed in his bid, I would venture this view, which is

that the fact that Scott Morrison has been so isolated on climate, refused to be part of the

solution, simply continues to be part of the problem - that would be a big reason why.



KARVELAS: You mention the Australians trying to get home. Do you believe all

Australians will be home by Christmas? Particularly given the addition restrictions on

hotel quarantine?



WONG: Tomorrow we have another Senate Select Committee which will hear evidence

from Departments and some stranded Australians. And we will

get a better handle on what the current status is. What I can tell you from the numbers

we've seen to date, is the numbers are going the wrong way and the only thing that's really

happened since Scott Morrison made that announcement is the number of people trying to

get home has increased. So, in fact, more people are stranded than when he made the

announcement that people would be home by Christmas. He'll try to get out of it, as he

always did, he’ll say I didn't mean everybody, I just meant the vulnerable people. We'll get

a chance tomorrow to listen to what departments had to say on it and see whether the

Prime Minister's announcement turns out to be as hollow as his previous announcements.



KARVELAS: So, is it time now to explore other options outside of city hotel

quarantining, not only because hotel quarantining has proven perhaps to be quite

vulnerable, and also to maximise those numbers?



WONG: We’ve said this for some time. It's not just Labor who has said this for some time -

that the Commonwealth needed to step up and take some federal responsibility for

quarantine. One of the Government's own handpicked advisors, Jane Halton, who

undertook a review, did make a recommendation about greater federal involvement in

quarantine. The reality is, Scott Morrison could show some leadership here. He’s left it to

the states and there's been some pretty dreadful consequences of some of what has

occurred. But more importantly, there hasn't been federal leadership and we

have seen both more people stranded overseas and problems in some of the state-run

facilities.



KARVELAS: What did you make of the Prime Minister's article in the Australian Financial

Review, arguing that China and the US should respect our decision not to pick sides?



WONG: If you have read or heard anything I’ve said over the last year, I’ve said for some

time we shouldn't let our foreign policy be defined by the strategic competition between the

US and China. We should be looking to building the region we want. The reality is our

region is being reshaped, in part by strategic competition, in part also by the pandemic,

and by climate change. This strategic change is something we have to take responsibility

for. Australia has to be more self-reliant and more ambitious. And we shouldn't allow our

foreign policy to be entirely defined by competition between the United States and China. I

think the way I phrased it was, when people say there's a choice, I say, well, we’ve already

made a choice, we're a US ally, but that's not the end of the matter.



KARVELAS: Do you think the Prime Minister's words will have an effect on Beijing?



WONG: I think China observes very carefully the discussion in Australia. But really, the

resolution to the challenges that we face in the bilateral relationship with China really have

to be resolved at the leadership level. John Howard put it pretty clearly, he said this has

been to be dealt with between President Xi and Prime Minister Morrison - it needs to be

resolved at that level.



I would say this; we're seeing ongoing trade disputation. There are many people whose

jobs and livelihoods depend on a productive trading relationship with China, and there's a

fair way to go before those people have confidence in the Prime Minister's leadership on

this issue. There seems to have been a bit of a view about ‘there's nothing to see here’.

Well, we know there are challenges, and the Prime Minister should take

former Prime Minister John Howard's advice and seek to resolve them at leadership level.



KARVELAS: Do you welcome the decision by Qatari authorities to charge the airport



security officials who conducted those invasive medical examinations of women at Doha

airport?



WONG: I think that the people who engaged in these actions should be held to account.

And justice should be done and be seen to be done. That is what the women who

experienced such a horrific, went through a horrific experience expect and deserve. I've

been disappointed by the response of Senator Payne, the Foreign Minister, and

the Government more generally. They didn't act until this became public. As you know,

Senator Payne didn't call her counterpart until she was asked to and it was suggested

to her she should publicly, by me and the Opposition, when Parliament was sitting. I'm

disappointed by the lack of support these women feel they received from

the Government. In fact, phone calls are reported not to have been made until the Minister

indicated that they would provide help and really, given the horrific experience these

women went through, I would have hoped we would have seen more empathy and more

private and public support from the Australian Government.



KARVELAS: Penny Wong, thanks for joining us this afternoon.



WONG: Good to speak with you, Patricia.
