$1.3 BILLION SUPPORT PACKAGE TO KEEP APPRENTICES AND  TRAINEES ON THE JOB

The Morrison Government is backing apprentices and trainees as part of the Government’s  Economic Response to the Coronavirus.

The $1.3 billion measure will ensure up to 70,000 small businesses can keep around 117,000  apprentices and trainees across the country in work and training. The investment is part of the  broader $17.6 billion package, designed to keep Australians in jobs and businesses in  business.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said apprentices and trainees are critical to meeting the skills needs of Australian  employers.

“We want them to keep learning, keep getting those essential skills that our economy needs to  keep business turning over, not just now, but well into the future,” Minister Cash said.

A 50 per cent wage subsidy of up to $21,000 will be available to small businesses which  employ fewer than 20 full time employees, including those using a Group Training  Organisation, to retain their apprentice or trainee. The subsidy will also be available to  businesses of any size and Group Training Organisations that re-engage an eligible apprentice  or trainee who would otherwise lose their job.

The new measure is in addition to existing apprenticeships incentives under the Australian  Apprenticeships Incentives Program.

Businesses can register to be assessed for eligibility from 2 April 2020. To be eligible for the  wage subsidy the apprentice or trainee must have been in-training with a small business as at  1 March 2020.

Assistant Minister for Vocational Education, Training and Apprenticeships, the Hon Steve  Irons MP said, that along with our $585 million Delivering Skills for Today and Tomorrow  package, this measure will ensure the Morrison Government continues the heavy lifting of  building the skilled workforce our economy needs.

“We know that industry needs more workers with technical, trade and practical skills. We are  backing Australians through incentives, funding and reform to ensure that the sector can  deliver the skilled and responsive workforce to meet these needs.”
