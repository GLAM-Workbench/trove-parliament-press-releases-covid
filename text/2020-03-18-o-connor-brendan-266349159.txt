SMALL BUSINESSES AND SOLE TRADERS SERIOUSLY CONCERNED

THAT STIMULUS PACKAGE FALLS SHORT



Many small businesses and sole traders have raised concerns with Federal Labor that they

are not receiving any or sufficient government support, yet are already being seriously

impacted by COVID 19.



Otherwise viable small businesses that are struggling or have ceased trading have raised

concerns the original small business economic stimulus package is not enough to keep

them going let alone filter through to their employees.



Sole traders are exasperated that not one single cent of support from the government’s

stimulus package will go directly to them.



Labor has been supportive of the Government’s original stimulus package but it has

become clear that it is not sufficient and we are concerned about the lack of direct support

for sole traders in the original stimulus package.



While we do have some concerns with the package, we are prepared to work with the

Government to resolve these issues to help sole traders receive the support they need - to



keep a roof over their heads, keep staff, and pay rent.



A welcome, although belated, step from Treasury is the establishment of a Business

Liaison Unit to provide information and advice to businesses.



Labor’s priority will always be to protect jobs, help Australian workers, businesses, families

and communities through this difficult time, and ensure vulnerable Australians are

supported.



The need for immediate and meaningful assistance for small businesses and sole traders

is vital.
