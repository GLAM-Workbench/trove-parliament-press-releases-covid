$30 million already paid to support travel agents

The Morrison Government is delivering emergency support to Australian travel agents, with  more than $33 million in COVID-19 Consumer Travel Support Program payments already  made.

Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Dan Tehan said more than 800 travel agents  had already received payments since the program opened in December. Another 1,500 are  currently being processed.

“Our Government is supporting travel agents as they deal with the extraordinary challenge of  COVID-19,” Mr Tehan said.

“I encourage all travel agents who haven’t applied yet to go online and start an application.  There are more than 2,500 small businesses with turnover below $500,000 who are eligible,  but many may not yet have applied.

“Providing support to travel agents will also protect Australians who have cancelled travel  plans and hold credit with agencies.”

The COVID-19 Consumer Travel Support Program provides a one-off grant ranging from  $1,500 up to $100,000 to support travel agents impacted by COVID-19.

“The program was designed in consultation with the Australian Federation of Travel Agents  (AFTA) and complements around $700 million in support already provided through  measures like JobKeeper, PAYG cashflow boosts, and loss carry back provisions,”   Mr Tehan said.

“I also encourage all Australians to support the local tourism industry by booking a domestic  holiday this year.

“All levels of government and industry are working together, to provide national policy  certainty so Australians have the confidence to make holiday plans.”
