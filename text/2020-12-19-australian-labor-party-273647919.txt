685 OLDER AUSTRALIANS DIE IN AGED CARE HOMES BUT COLBECK  KEEPS HIS JOB

Scott Morrison has failed every older Australian by keeping Richard Colbeck as a Minister  and continuing to give him responsibility for our nation’s broken aged care system.

If Morrison had any respect for the 685 older Australians who have tragically died from  COVID-19 in aged care homes, Richard Colbeck would no longer have his job.

The Royal Commission found the Morrison Government didn’t have a plan for COVID-19 in  aged care but the Minister has kept his job.

Does anyone take responsibility for anything in this Government?

Richard Colbeck will still be responsible for aged care services and Greg Hunt will be  looking over his shoulder.

Greg Hunt’s fingerprints are all over the Morrison Government’s aged care failures. Today’s  shuffling of the deck chairs will sadly change nothing for older Australians.

Greg Hunt will now be responsible for leading Australia’s response to a once in a century  global pandemic, and a once in a generation chance to fix our nation’s broken aged care  system.

Day after day the evidence mounts of serious neglect in aged care and every day all we  see from the Morrison Government is running away, passing the buck and not accepting  responsibility for its own failures.

Neglect. That’s the legacy of this Government when it comes to aged care.
