PETA MURPHY MP  MEMBER FOR DUNKLEY





E&OE TRANSCRIPT  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  SEAFORD  THURSDAY, 21 JANUARY 2021

SUBJECT: Scott Morrisonâ€™s failure to deliver infrastructure promises.

PETA MURPHY, MEMBER FOR DUNKLEY: Good morning. I am Peta Murphy  the Federal Member for Dunkley and I am really pleased to have Catherine King  here today to talk about the Morrison Government's failure to deliver on the  promises that it made in the election and the lead up to the election in 2019. We  are in beautiful Frankston and we are here at Kananook Station, one of the sites  of a thought bubble promise for a car park at the train station and locals know  that there's been a promise but nothing's been delivered. So, thank you very  much Catherine for being here today.

CATHERINE KING, SHADOW MINISTER FOR INFRASTRUCTURE,  TRANSPORT AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Thanks Peta. Well in the  2019 Election Campaign, Scott Morrison made much of his Urban Congestion  Fund and that he was going to get more commuters into car parks around public  transport. Well, I'm here in Dunkley with Peta Murphy today at Kananook  Station to see what an absolute lie that was. The Morrison Government is all  about spin and little about delivery. They promised in the 2019 election  campaign 67 commuter car parks across the nation. We're here at one of them,  and there is no sign of any building being done at all. We know from Senate  Estimates that of the 67 car parks that Scott Morrison promised communities  across this country that only four, four, have actually started having any work  done on them at all and there is no sign of any work being done here at  Kananook Station or across the many car parks that the Morrison government  promised. Here again we have the Morrison Government all about spin, all



about the media release, but not about the delivery. They have underspent in  the Urban Congestion Fund, and the Commuter Car Park fund in particular,  underspent by over $500 million last financial year alone. That's money that  could have gone into infrastructure throughout this COVID crisis, money that  could have gone into the economy and money that could have helped pay to  actually get car parking at important railway stations like Kananook. Again, we  see the Morrison Government all spin and no delivery. You can't park on press  releases, you actually need to have the car parks built, and that's what they've  failed to do.
