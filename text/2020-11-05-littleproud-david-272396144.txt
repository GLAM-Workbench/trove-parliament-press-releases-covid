Extraordinary meeting of Ministers for Emergency Management to  discuss the response to the Bushfire Royal Commission

The Commonwealth has today chaired a meeting of all Australian Emergency  Management Ministers regarding the findings of the Royal Commission into National  Natural Disaster Arrangements, also known as the Bushfire Royal Commission.

The meeting provided an important opportunity to establish an environment of cooperation  for Ministers to discuss the Royal Commission’s findings and to set expectations that all  governments will respond meaningfully, comprehensively and urgently, as our  communities would expect.

I am pleased that there was broad agreement amongst jurisdictions about the need to  work collaboratively in responding to the report’s findings and recommendations.

Ministers acknowledged that a number of actions recommended by the Royal  Commission, such as streamlining fire warning systems across the nation along with  consistent disaster payments, are already underway.

The Commonwealth looks forward to this work continuing, including greater efforts to  streamline and coordinate preparation and recovery mechanisms across the country.

Emergency Management Ministers also wished to reassure the public that significant  response plans are in place this disaster season, and that those plans take into account  the current COVID environment.

Following today’s meeting, National Cabinet will meet next week to further discuss our  collective response to the Royal Commission.
