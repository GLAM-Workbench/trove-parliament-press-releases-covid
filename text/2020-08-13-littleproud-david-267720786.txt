More than $36 million for Queensland bushfire recovery

Under the backdrop of the worst economic disaster in a generation, Queensland’s ongoing  recovery efforts from the 2019 bushfires continue with a $36.8 million investment to  support the state’s most heavily bushfire-impacted communities.

The Queensland Reconstruction Authority (QRA) will administer the $36.8 million Local  Economic Recovery Fund, which is jointly delivered by the Australian and Queensland  Governments on a 50/50 basis through Category D of the Disaster Recovery Funding  Arrangements (DRFA).

Councils and state agencies within 13 local government areas can apply for up to             $5 million in funding, including Bundaberg, Gladstone, Gympie, Ipswich, Livingstone,  Lockyer Valley, Mareeba, Noosa, Scenic Rim, Somerset, Southern Downs, Sunshine  Coast and Toowoomba.

Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management David Littleproud said the  bushfires of 2019 had a devastating and ongoing impact on many Queenslanders.

“This bushfire recovery funding is about ensuring the recovery of the most heavily  impacted communities can continue, especially in light of the COVID-19 situation,” Minister  Littleproud said.

“Today’s announcement is part of the Commonwealth’s $448.5 million commitment to fund  recovery projects around Australia so towns and regions can get back on their feet  following last summer’s fires.

“The allocation to Queensland will see more than $36 million shared between projects in  the 13 most heavily impacted local government areas, supporting their local economic  recovery.

“This joint funding is for projects that support local and regional recovery, with funding  allocated based on community needs.

“That could be economic or social, in relation to the rebuilding of infrastructure, or to do  with the natural environment,” he said.

“Local councils will have a key role in putting the right projects forward and I encourage  communities to engage with their local council on recovery priorities.”

Queensland Treasurer and Minister responsible for the QRA Cameron Dick said the Local  Economic Recovery Fund would prove crucial in helping Queensland bounce back from  one of its toughest ever periods.

“The crippling economic effects we’re now seeing as a result of COVID-19 have only  added more stress to parts of our state that were already pushed to the limits,” Mr Dick  said.

“Battling severe bushfires in 2019, and drought for an extended period before that, these  affected regions were hurting long before the current pandemic arrived.

“That’s why we’re getting this funding out the door fast, to create more work in  communities as we Unite and Recover for Queensland Jobs.

“Our government is focused on delivering its economic recovery plan for Queensland, and  this funding partnership with the Commonwealth will be a real boost to our ongoing efforts.

“Every project backed through this fund will help Queensland businesses, workers and  families,” he said.

“So whether an eligible council or state agency is looking to build or strengthen  infrastructure, deliver local support services or host community activities and events, I  encourage them to submit an expression of interest.”

Expressions of interest can be made until 7 September 2020.
