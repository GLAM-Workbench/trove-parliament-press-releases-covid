INTERVIEW ON THE TODAY SHOW  12 August 2020

Subjects: Coronavirus, Border Closures;

KARL STEFANOVIC

Closed until Christmas, that's the minimum forecast for Australia's current border closures with  some State leaders revealing it could be up to 18 months before we see the tough controls lifted.

ALLISON LANGDON

For more on this, we are joined by Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack, who is in Darwin and  infectious disease expert Dr Paul Griffin in Brisbane. Gentlemen, thanks for joining us this morning.  Michael, WA says a year, the Northern Territory says at least another 18 months, seriously?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

We will take the best medical advice and I appreciate that this is very much the role of the States  and Territories to make these determinations for their own areas, for their own people. But, we've  said all along that we'll take the best medical advice and that's what we'll do. One thing will be sure  and that is people will be holidaying at home and across Australia, so for our very much coronavirus-ravaged tourism industry, that is at least some little bit of a shining light.

KARL STEFANOVIC

Michael, if the borders are closed for that long, some are saying Christmas in Queensland, Northern  Territory, WA, that's going to be catastrophic to tourism and it’s going to be catastrophic to the  budget.









MICHAEL McCORMACK

It is indeed. And what I was saying before is that, intra-state travel will be possible but let’s not get  too far ahead of ourselves -

KARL STEFANOVIC

But will it?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves. I realise the health crisis has to be contained and minimised.  State Premiers and Chief Ministers have made those border closures to protect their own regions,  their own jurisdictions. It's an unfortunate situation but I think they're putting the worst-case  scenario there, Karl.

ALLISON LANGDON

We keep talking about what this is going to do to the economy, but I keep thinking about the  families. Families who live in different states. You’ve got grandparents who haven't met  grandchildren. People with sick or dying relatives that they can't get to. From a family point of view, I  don't understand how you can do this to people.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

It's awful. It is absolutely awful, but the important thing is that people stay healthy as best they can.  Follow the advice. Download the COVIDSafe app. Do everything they've been asked to do. If they're  in self-isolation, follow the rules. Look out for not just themselves but for others indeed, the most  vulnerable members of society, our aged.

ALLISON LANGDON

Michael, are there conversations taking place behind the scenes between the Premiers, the Prime  Minister and yourself as to what can be done to ensure that these borders can re-open sooner?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Indeed, on a daily, if not hourly basis. We will continue to do that. Of course, the National Cabinet  process has worked so far so good. We need to be our best selves. As we've just heard, we need to  make sure absolutely that we do all the right things. Not just for our own sake, our own family's sake  but indeed for those other members of society. If people are being asked to quarantine, for  goodness sake, stay in quarantine. Do the right thing. States ought to take every available assistance  that is being provided by the Commonwealth and also they're going to need to do a lot more  themselves as far as economic assistance for businesses and for those industries to help get through  this. The Commonwealth has provided so far $314 billion of assistance. This is not just a health





situation, it is also very much an economic situation which we need to address, which we are  addressing but we need everybody to be on board.

KARL STEFANOVIC

And Deputy Prime Minister, did Daniel Andrews lie about the ADF being called-in?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

You'd have to ask Daniel Andrews that. I know that the ADF were there ready. Yesterday, 1,743 ADF  personnel were helping out in all sorts of areas in Victoria. What a difference they make. Just for  reassurance - if that was the only thing they provided, that integrity of the uniform, they were  always there ready to serve, to assist. Linda Reynolds made that point very clear yesterday. That was  always the case.

KARL STEFANOVIC

Good to talk to you, thank you, really appreciate it.
