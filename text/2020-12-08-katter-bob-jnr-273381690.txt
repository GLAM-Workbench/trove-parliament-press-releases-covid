Katter questions Qantas outsourcing of 2,000 jobs to Chinese  company  KENNEDY MP, Bob Katter has used question time to question the decision of Qantas to outsource  2000 ground-handling jobs to a Chinese owned company.

Mr Katter questioned whether Attorney-General and Industrial Relations Minister, Christian  Porter, would step in to save Australian jobs.

“Mr Speaker! Attorney-General, surely the two Cs—COVID and China's bullying, intimidation and  degradation—now make self-reliance a national imperative?” Mr Katter asked.

“Consequently, would you overrule Mr Joyce and Qantas's sacking of 2,000 baggage handlers and  the offshoring of this high-security work to a Chinese corporation? With most of our mining  reserves, sugar mills, major farms and 55 per cent of our electricity already gone, doesn't  government need urgently to demonstrate a slowdown in the sell-off of Australia?

“As at June this year, Qantas had received more than $531m from the Government due to Covid-19 impacts, and yet they continue to favour profits and foreign companies over Australian workers  - with 8,500 sacked this year.”

Last week Mr Katter met with the Transport Workers Union and three Qantas workers in his  Canberra office.

“These are the workers that the Government must look in the face; that the Board and CEO of  Qantas must face up to,” he said.

“The major parties have overseen the offshoring, outsourcing and casualisation of aviation jobs.  This is a national disgrace.”
