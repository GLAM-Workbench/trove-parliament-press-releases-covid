Statement on Cabinet Appointment

29 March 2021

I am honoured by the Prime Minister’s announcement of my appointment to the Cabinet.

The elevation of the Defence Industry portfolio is recognition of the critical role defence  industry plays in the Morrison Government’s plans for post-COVID economic recovery and  capability delivery for the Australian Defence Force.

Since my appointment as Minister for Defence Industry, I have focused on identifying the  barriers and opportunities available to Australian businesses, ensuring that they get a fair go  in the roll out of our $270 billion defence investment.

I will continue to build on the reforms that I have already delivered including changes which  hold defence giants to account, ensuring they deliver opportunities for Australian  businesses, increasing support and access for Australian SMEs to ensure they are defence  ready and delivering a truly sovereign industrial capability.

I look forward to working closely with new Minister for Defence, Peter Dutton and working to  deliver the best outcomes for the Australian Defence Force and generations of Australians  seeking exciting jobs in defence industry.

The Morrison Government has delivered for defence industry, but there is more to do and I  will be using my position in Cabinet to ensure Australia’s defence industry delivers the  economic prosperity and world class capability needed to defend the nation and our  interests.
