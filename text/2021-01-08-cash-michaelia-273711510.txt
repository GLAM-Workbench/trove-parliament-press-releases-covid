SUPPORTING GREATER BRISBANE  THROUGH COVID-19

The Australian Government will lift mutual obligation requirements for job seekers  in the Greater Brisbane area from today 8 January 2021 until Sunday 17 January 2021.

This follows an announcement by the Queensland Government that Greater Brisbane will  undertake a three-day shutdown to curb a COVID-19 outbreak in the area.

No job seeker in the affected areas will face payment suspension or financial penalties for  failing to meet their mutual obligation requirements - such as not being able to  attend appointments or activities.

Job seekers are still being encouraged to remain connected to employment services to ensure  they are supported to access the full range of assistance including mental health services, if  required.

This will apply to job seekers in jobactive, Online Employment Services and Disability  Employment Services and participants in ParentsNext.

The Australian Government will continue to closely monitor the situation in Queensland.
