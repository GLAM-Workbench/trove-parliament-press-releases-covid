E&OE TRANSCRIPT

DOORSTOP INTERVIEW

PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA

MONDAY, 24 AUGUST 2020



SUBJECTS: Crisis in aged care; branch stacking allegations in the Liberal party;

Scott Morrisonâ€™s leadership.



SENATOR PENNY WONG, SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Good

morning. It's good to be back here in Canberra.



Can I say first, to the many people who are worried about their grandmother, grandfather,

a relative in aged care: we will ensure that this Government takes some responsibility.



To all those who have lost someone, to the 313 families who have lost someone to date,

as a result of a death in an aged care facility we say you have our deepest sympathies and

we will hold this Government to account.



Because when it comes to aged care what we can see yet again, is that Mr Morrison is a

leader who is much more interested in headlines than helping. It's all photo op and no

follow up.



And he has appointed an incompetent Minister, a Minister who doesn't even know how

many people have passed, a Minister who's not across his brief to preside over a system

which is broken, which was broken before COVID happened, and in which the Government

did not prepare for the pandemic.



So it's time for Mr Morrison to show some leadership. It's time for him to take responsibility



for the crisis in aged care. It was a system that was already broken. And it's a system

which they did not prepare for what was coming.



I also want to make some comments about Michael Sukkar. The revelations on television

last night were deeply concerning.



They were appalling. They were shocking.



They were what Mr Morrison previously described as corruption, in June. The same

behaviours he described as corruption.



Well Anthony Albanese and the Labor Party acted. Ministers lost their job. The Labor Party

intervened in the Victorian branch.



This is a test for Scott Morrison. This is a test for him to stamp out the corruption in the

Victorian branch.



And if he fails to do so it will speak volumes about his leadership, or lack of it. It's a test for

Scott Morrison as Prime Minister of the day.



Thanks very much.
