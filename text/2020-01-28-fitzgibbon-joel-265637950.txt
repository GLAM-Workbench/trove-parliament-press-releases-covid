THE HON JOEL FITZGIBBON MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCES  MEMBER FOR HUNTER



MCKENZIE MISSING IN ACTION AGAIN

The Agriculture Minister should urgently explain her absence from today’s Drought and  Flood Recovery Roundtable in Orange and press conference with the Prime Minister, says  Shadow Agriculture Minister Joel Fitzgibbon.

“Our drought-affected farmers are right to expect their Minister to be energetically engaged  in all announcements and discussions about the impacts of climatic events on their  livelihoods,” said Mr Fitzgibbon. “Today, Bridget McKenzie is missing in action again.”

Mr Fitzgibbon said Minister McKenzie’s attention had to be on issues such as the long-running drought, recent bushfires, the presence of African Swine Fever and a biosecurity  emergency such as the Coronavirus outbreak in China.

The Drought and Flood Recovery Roundtable called by the Prime Minister was intended to  update the Government on progress in the recovery effort for the 2019 Queensland floods  and the recent bushfires.

“The sports-rorts controversy has sent the Minister into hiding at a crucial time for our  farmers. The Prime Minister must act to replace her with someone capable of representing  our farmers in the Cabinet and willing and able to speak out on agriculture issues.”
