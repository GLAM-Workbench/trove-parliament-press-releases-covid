2020-21 BUDGET: FAR-REACHING BENEFITS FOR INDIGENOUS  AUSTRALIANS

The Morrison Government is empowering and supporting Indigenous Australians through the  2020-21 Budget.

The Budget delivers investments in health, housing, education, employment, all while  strengthening the capability of Indigenous organisations and communities that support this  work.

Minister for Indigenous Australians, the Hon Ken Wyatt AM, MP, said “Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander people will continue to be front of mind as the Government rebuilds the  economy through the COVID-19 pandemic and charts the course to economic recovery.”

Across the Commonwealth’s portfolios, Indigenous Australians will benefit from:

Ã¯ÂÂ· The continued commitment to the $5.4 billion Indigenous Advancement Strategy to  support programmes that reduce the rates of Indigenous incarceration, youth suicide,  family and domestic violence; and improve health, safety, wellbeing, education,  employment and economic opportunities.

Ã¯ÂÂ· The continued commitment of $4 billion in Indigenous health funding over the coming  four years through the Department of Health, including $975.5 million in 2020-21.

Ã¯ÂÂ· $16.7 million will be provided to states and territories for targeted and specific  programs to improve the health of Indigenous Australians.

Ã¯ÂÂ· $4 million to continue the Remote Point of Care testing program, reducing the risk  COVID-19 presents to remote Indigenous communities.

Ã¯ÂÂ· $150 million over three years to expand Indigenous Business Australia’s (IBA)  Indigenous Home Ownership Program (IHOP), providing 360 new construction home  loans and supporting jobs in regional Australia. This helps Indigenous families move  into their own home and start to build intergenerational wealth, while addressing  overcrowding and stimulating the economies of regional and remote Australia.

Ã¯ÂÂ· $100 million to finalise the agreement with the Queensland Government to deliver  more housing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in remote Queensland.

Ã¯ÂÂ· $46.5 million over four years to support the National Agreement on Closing the Gap  and build the capacity of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community-controlled organisation sector to improve local service delivery. This funding will be  complemented by co-contributions from state and territory governments.



Ã¯ÂÂ· $10.1 million over four years for the Productivity Commission to provide independent  oversight and accountability of progress under the National Agreement on Closing  the Gap. As well as supporting the comprehensive review of progress every three  years, this measure includes developing and maintaining an information dashboard  and an annual data report that all parties can use in reporting their performance  against the Agreement.

Ã¯ÂÂ· $39.8 million over four years for the Clontarf Foundation to support young Indigenous  students improve their self-esteem, confidence, leadership skills and engagement,  delivering a further 2,000 places on top of the 10,500 already on offer.

Ã¯ÂÂ· $10.1 million over four years for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander Studies (AIATSIS) to continue its highly successful Return of Cultural  Heritage initiative, bringing back to Australia objects of great significance to  traditional owners.

Ã¯ÂÂ· The bringing forward of $5.4 million over four years to support the Office of the  Registrar of Indigenous Corporations to upgrade its systems and implement a  Director Identification Number. As part of the Government’s Digital Business Plan,  this will provide traceability of a director’s relationships across companies, enable  better tracking of failed companies and prevent the use of fictitious identities.

Ã¯ÂÂ· $3.9 million to extend the Time to Work Employment Services program to 2022,  helping Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people prepare for employment  following their release from prison.

Ã¯ÂÂ· $4.1 million over two years to create four new Indigenous River Ranger groups in the  Murray-Darling Basin, improving access to water and ensuring Aboriginal people are  part of the delivery of the Basin plan.

Ã¯ÂÂ· The extension of children and parenting support services by $40.1 million over three  years from 2021-22, providing specialised early intervention and prevention support  to at-risk children and families with complex needs.

Ã¯ÂÂ· $27 million for a regional arts package that will include support for Indigenous Arts  Centres that have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.

Ã¯ÂÂ· $3.5 million over two years for land management and hazard reduction works and  engagement activities at the Rum Jungle mine site near Batchelor, Northern  Territory.

Ã¯ÂÂ· $2.2 million over four years to expedite assessment of applications and improve the  administration of new applications under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  Heritage Protection Act 1984.

Ã¯ÂÂ· $2 million as part of the Perth City Deal to progress designs for the Noongar  Indigenous Cultural Centre.

Additionally, the Government’s Indigenous Procurement Policy continues to grow with more  Indigenous businesses winning higher value contracts and contributing an ever-increasing  amount to government supply chains. In 2020-21, the value target increases to 1.25 per  cent, working towards 3 per cent of all Commonwealth contracts being awarded to  Indigenous businesses by 2028.

Indigenous Australians will also benefit from increases to mainstream services, including  more funding for mental health and suicide prevention initiatives, expedited handling of  family law matters, more support for victims of domestic and family violence, increased  numbers of apprentices and trainees, and a package of measures to support regional  Australia recover from impacts of COVID-19 and recent natural disasters.

Tax relief, wage subsidies for young workers and enhanced asset write-offs for businesses  will provide further economic and employment opportunity for Indigenous Australians and  support Australia’s growing Indigenous business sector.

The 2020-21 Budget is delivering the jobs and essential services Australia needs to turn  around the COVID-19 recession and respond to the incredible challenges of 2020.
