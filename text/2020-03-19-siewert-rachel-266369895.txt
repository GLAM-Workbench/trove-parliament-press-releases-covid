Close the Gap Day and COVID19

COVID-19 has the potential to cause severe harm to First Nations communities

particularly in regional and remote areas, older Australians, disabled people

and people with mental health issues.

“Preventing and slowing the spread of the virus to First Nations communities

must be a priority given that First Nations communities already suffer higher

rates of chronic and respiratory illness than the general population,” Senator

Rachel Siewert, spokesperson on First Nations issues said.

“We have a narrow window of opportunity to prevent the spread of the virus in

First Nations remote communities.

“We already know that current policy approaches have failed to Close the Gap

in health and education outcomes. We cannot get this wrong at such a critical

time and Government must listen to the experts particularly First Nations health

experts and be led by First Nations communities.

“The Australian government must exercise its duty of care.”

On Close the Gap Day the Greens support First Nation calls for:
