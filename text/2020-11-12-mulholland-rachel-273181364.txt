Trust in government institutions has tripled during COVID-19 crisis











AUSTRALIA -



Ã¢ÂÂ



Trust in government institutions has been on the rise in Australia during the







COVID-19 crisis with ‘high trust’ increasing from 18 per cent in 2018 to 46 percent in October 2020,







according to a new PwC survey.















Most notable, despite dramatically increased Government involvement in citizens' lives highlighted by







lockdowns, the PwC 2020 Citizen Survey of 3,800+ Australians finds trust in the Federal Government







rose from 39 per cent during the bushfires to 54 per cent during the ongoing pandemic.











Responsive actions from government institutions to citizen needs and increased perceptions of







honesty during COVID-19 has driven this result.  Almost half of citizen’s responding to the survey also







reported that the government response to COVID-19 has made them feel highly secure.















PwC’s Citizen Survey questioned trust in government over a range of perceptions including whether







they see government as honest, use personal data responsibly and ethically and spend taxpayer funds







efficiently.











The biggest increase in government trust from 2018 to 2020 came from citizens agreeing that “I can







depend on government institutions to be responsive to support me when I am in need” (+21% pts),







followed by “government institutions are honest” (+20% pts).















Diane Rutter, PwC Australia Partner says “Our different levels of Government, Federal, State and Local







Council, have supported Australian citizens during the pandemic through coordinated health







responses and targeted economic support for those most impacted.











“If citizens do not trust governments, it becomes harder for government policies to succeed - policies







that exist to support the very wellbeing of the citizens they are designed to benefit.















“Our survey suggests that trust in all levels of Government has increased and government entities







should consider how they repay, maintain and increase this trust in a sustainable way.”











The data shows that more responsive services is a clear path to achieve this. Government leaders can







focus on a number of high-impact areas to achieve this, including:











Ã¢ÂÂ



Communicate and influence:



Ã¢ÂÂ



Ensuring communication with citizens is timely, informed,







relevant and consistent whilst being empathetic to their immediate context and needs.







Ã¢ÂÂ



Listen and take decisive action:



Ã¢ÂÂ



Capture and respond to feedback from citizens in real







time to adapt and action quickly to their needs.
