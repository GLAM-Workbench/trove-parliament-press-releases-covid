AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE FOR BUSHFIRE  AFFECTED COMMUNITIES IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA

The Australian Government has activated the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment  (AGDRP) and Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA).

One-off payments of $1000 per adult and $400 per child will be available to people living in the  Mundaring and Swan local government areas, which the fires have hit the hardest.

Minister for Emergency Management David Littleproud said the package provides assistance to  those who have suffered a significant loss, including a severely damaged or destroyed home.

“Our first concern is for the safety and needs of those directly affected, particularly those who have  lost their homes in this bushfire,” Minister Littleproud said.

“This will give dignity to those who have suffered the worst in the fires and help them through the  next few days.

“We’re also making the Disaster Recovery Allowance available to people who have lost their  income because of the bushfires.”

People eligible for DRA can access income assistance for up to 13 weeks, equivalent to the  maximum rate of JobSeeker or Youth Allowance.

Equivalent financial assistance will also be available to eligible New Zealand citizens   (‘non-protected’ Special Category Visa, subclass 444 holders) affected by the bushfires.

The Australian Government Crisis Committee and Australian Government Disaster Recovery  Committee are also meeting today to ensure that the Commonwealth can be prepared for any  further assistance that may be required by Western Australia.



For more information visit www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/disaster. Due to COVID-19 restrictions,  the best way to make a claim is to call 180 22 66. The hotline will be open business hours 8 am to  5 pm from Thursday 4 February 2021.
