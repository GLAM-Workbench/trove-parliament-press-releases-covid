INTERVIEW WITH LEON COMPTON, ABC HOBART

Topics: Aged Care Royal Commission, Vaccine rollout.

E&OE…

Leon Compton:

It's been amazing, over the past couple of nights, trying to read through and digest the  findings of the Royal Commission into Aged Care. Amazing because of the breadth of  reforms that were recommended in terms of administration and bureaucracy and oversight. I  mean, the central philosophy of aged care was invited to be reviewed in this country. The  expansion, as I say, that was recommended to improve the conditions for those falling upon  the aged care system in this country was staggering. So what is the process from here?

Liberal Party Senator, Richard Colbeck, the Liberal Party Senator for Tasmania, is from this  part of the state and joins us in William Street this morning. Minister, good morning to you.

Richard Colbeck:

Morning, Leon.

Leon Compton:

There's a big question that comes to you as you read the recommendations in this report.  Even, Minister, if your Government was competent to drive the reforms recommended, the  massive reforms by the royal commission, ideologically, how would you convince your party  to embrace the expansion of bureaucracy, the administration, the oversight, the operational  demands in this document?

Richard Colbeck:

Well Leon, I don't think it's necessarily a matter of an expansion of bureaucracy. One of the  principle questions that sits within this report is how the bureaucracy works and how it  engages with government. And that's one of the key points of difference between the  commissioners, whether it's a bureaucracy that's managed more directly by government  through the ministerial process that we have now, or whether the administration of aged care  is moved to a separate bureaucracy with its own governance structure.

Leon Compton:

[Talks over] Either way, Minister, that was enormous.

Richard Colbeck:

So it's a huge philosophical question. You're right. It is a big question. And it's one of the  questions that we are going to have to answer as a part of our response to the royal  commission report. We've said that we would respond to the report fully by the end of May.  But the fundamental response is going to come in the budget, whereas- which is where we  will lay out our response to the reforms, the changes that are proposed within this  commission report, and also the financing of it as well.

Leon Compton:

Ultimately, this report seems to make a suite of recommendations anathema to the writing,  [indistinct] the way that the Liberal Party approaches government in terms of administration  and bureaucracy, in terms of a better and more stringent oversight of the private sector - if the  private sector continues in the aged care space at all - a growing of services, not a shrinking  of them. How will you be able to convince your fellow cabinet ministers that any of the paths  recommended by the commission are ones to go down?

Richard Colbeck:

Well look, I don't think it's going to be such a stretch as you might consider. Obviously, the  Prime Minister was very concerned about this particular area of our society. When he came to  the role as Prime Minister it was one of the very first acts that he undertook, was to call this  royal commission and set the terms of reference. I know he remains extremely concerned  about this area. I have had an extraordinary amount of interaction with him and my  ministerial colleagues over the course of the royal commission and particularly over the last  12 months with what we've been through in aged care. And we've been, obviously, watching  very closely what the royal commission has been saying through its hearings; we've been  looking very closely at the draft recommendations prepared by the counsel assisting that were  presented to the commissioners last year; and we've been working to consider how we will  respond. This sector does need a lot of reform, Leon, there's no question about that. The issue  around the scale and the capacity of it is a real one. But we've invested, since the Prime  Minister came to the job, more than $5.5 billion just in home care packages - 87,000 home  care packages into the system.

Leon Compton:

[Talks over] Yeah, Minister, lets

Richard Colbeck:

So it's a significant investment which-

Leon Compton:

[Interrupts] Lets pick up that issue for a moment.

Richard Colbeck:

Sure.

Leon Compton:

Because you and I over years have spoken about home care packages, and you have made the  argument over years on the Mornings programme that there wasn't enough money to pay for  everybody that needed home care packages and was eligible for them to get those packages.  You've argued that personally and, as the Minister responsible for years. Now, you've got a  royal commission telling you it should take 30 days at the most and that should start from the  end of this year. Isn't that a repudiation of the way your Government, you as Minister, have  approached these issues specifically?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, I can test the premise of your point to start with, Leon. We have continued to grow  home care, as I've been able to convince my colleagues around the Cabinet table to put in  additional resources. And I have to say, over the last 12 months or so they've been extremely  receptive - there will be nearly 40,000 new packages going to the system this financial year  alone. When I came to the Ministry we were projected to get to 157,000 home care packages  by 22-23. We're going to get to 197,000 home care packages by the end of this financial year.  So there has been a recognition of the need to grow. But there's also been a recognition, and I  said this when the royal commission's interim report came down, that we had to grow this  sector- this part of the sector responsibly and that 1200 new home care packages we’re  offering a week is 200 jobs a week. So we have to grow-

Leon Compton:

[Interrupts] But Minister, it’s not about growing it responsibly.

Richard Colbeck:

Well, actually, Leon, it is. Because one of those things-

Leon Compton:

[Interrupts] It’s about growing it to respond to the needs of the people, and to accommodate  the needs of everybody that is deemed eligible.

Media inquiries | Aaron Langmaid | 0456 889 018  Authorised by Senator Richard Colbeck, Tasmania





Richard Colbeck:

Well actually, actually, Leon, it's both. Because if we- One of the things that this- the final  report talks about is the oversight and regulation of home care, and the requirement for that to  have the appropriate level of oversight. We also want to reform the way that home care is  delivered, and we indicated that when the interim report came down. And we were looking  forward to the recommendations of the final report because the royal commission has said  that they wanted to have a say in how home care was going to be reformed. So we now have  that report. So we need to reform the sector, and then - going to your point - we need to  provide the capacity of the home care sector to provide the appropriate level of support for  people when and as they need it. And that's one of the fundamental questions that we have to  answer as part of the royal commission report.

Leon Compton:

I'm thinking about our listeners this morning who'll be waiting for a knock on the door and  it'll be their home care provider coming in to help them, well, depending on whether their  category 1 through to category 4, with a range of tasks. That worker who knocks on the door,  they might be rostered on for a two hour shift and they might be earning as little as $15 an  hour. How can you attract the workforce of caring, competent people that you need to knock  on that door? Is there, in the payment [indistinct]…?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, I doubt they’d be earning, I doubt they’d be earning $15 an hour, Leon, because that's  less than minimum wage. So, if they’re earning that someone's not paying them properly,  which is not appropriate. But look, I- to take your core point, we do need to reform this  sector, and I think even COVID has changed the way a lot of these systems operate because  we've had to - it's forced us to change. So the reform of the home care sector is a big piece, is  a significant piece. But if I look at, and we talk about the capacity of the system, if I look at  my community or a community here in Burnie, where we've got providers who are providing  home care services; they're providing CHSP; they're providing veterans care; and, they're also  providing NDIS. So we are we are looking a bit broader than just the aged care sector. How  do we make very, very good community-based businesses viable to provide care across these  different categories; ensure that they're viable; and, make sure that that's done at most  affordable cost to the taxpayer, which is one of the questions that we're going to have to deal  with; and, most efficiently? So this, as you quite rightly indicate, is a huge reform.

Leon Compton:

I ask you this question respectfully. Are you, as Minister; are you, as a Government, actually  up to the scale of reform?

Richard Colbeck:

Oh absolutely. And I think that we are, as I said, we’ve been looking very closely at the  commission as it’s gone on. We’ve been looking at the draft recommendations and we

Media inquiries | Aaron Langmaid | 0456 889 018  Authorised by Senator Richard Colbeck, Tasmania





needed to do that because we’ve said that we would respond more fully to the  commissioner’s report in the budget. Now, that’s only about 10 weeks away. So, yes, there’s  a fair bit of work to be done in that period of time but we’ve got some very fundamental  questions to answer as a part of that process, including how it’s paid for.

Leon Compton:

The Federal Minister for Aged Care, Senator Richard Colbeck is our guest this morning. And  from this part of the state, he joins us from William Street in Devonport and it’s lovely to  have your company this morning. Can you name one achievement by the Government, since  2013, that has approached this scale of complexity and size, in terms of federal reform?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, I think you only have to look at the last 12 months and the way that this country,  through National Cabinet, has managed to get through COVID, using the National Cabinet  process. There’s been some challenges along the way but we’ve stepped up to them and met  them. We’re starting, over the last week or so, the biggest- one of the biggest logistic  exercises that you’ll ever see, which is the vaccination of 26 million people. So, everybody  who’s living in this country will be offered a vaccination. So look, I-

Leon Compton:

[Interrupts] Does that even come close to approaching the scale and complexity of the policy,  the suite of policies that you’ll need to embrace to start to scratch the sides of the  recommendations of this royal commission? I’m asking if this is the biggest task, by some  margin, the Government’s been set since 2013.

Richard Colbeck:

Look in a policy sense, I think it’s pretty big. There’s no question about that. But can I say, in  my own mind, working with my colleagues and the work that I know that we’ve done so far,  I think we’re in a pretty good space to be able to manage this. It is a huge job. There is a lot  of work to do. The royal commission said it’s a five-year reform task. Some in the industry  have been saying to me that it’ll take longer; I don’t think that’s acceptable. But I think  you’re right and the royal commission is right, and I said this when the report was released on  Monday, being in the portfolio and the events of the last 18 months or so have really made  me question, fundamentally, the way that we deliver aged care in this country, including  whether or not residential aged care, for example, is something that we should maintain. So,  my thought process has gone right back to fundamentals as part of this process.

Leon Compton:

Sorry, can you just tease that out for me? Including whether residential aged care is  something we maintain - what do you mean by that? Can you tease that out for me?

Richard Colbeck:

Media inquiries | Aaron Langmaid | 0456 889 018  Authorised by Senator Richard Colbeck, Tasmania





Well, it’s a question one of the commissioners asked as well and I’ve done some reading on  that. So the scale and the intensity of residential aged care is something that is probably a  convenience for the community as much as anything else. And so the report, when it was  brought down, the interim report when it was brought down, questioned society’s approach to  aged care, which has changed over many years. I mean, once upon a time, people used to  look after their older family members in their own home. So all of those things that have  changed. So it took me back to first principles and then if we’re going to continue to operate  in that sense, how do we change it for the better? What are the systems that make it better?  Commissioner Briggs, for example, was talking about smaller scale facilities. You’ve talked  to Lucio(*) [indistinct] on a number of occasions with the work that they're doing down at  Korongee in a dementia sense. So what are the things that we do to change the way that we  deliver, particularly residential aged care?

Leon Compton:

Minister, can you imagine a time when the private for profit providers are out of the  provision of residential aged care?

Richard Colbeck:

No, I don't. I think they still have a place. But one of the things that comes through in the  royal commission's report is the accountability of the taxpayers’ money that goes into those  providers and how it’s spent. And my view is that that's one of the things that you'll see in the  context of change. We don't have good enough financial accountability and reporting. I found  that to be an issue in just my administration of the portfolio since I've been in it. So that is  something that needs to improve, along with so many other things that the royal commission  talks about.

Leon Compton:

Just to follow on- a couple of final [indistinct] questions - I walked down the street. You were  listening to those before we spoke this morning. Everybody that we spoke to, and I made sure  that we spoke to some young people as well who’d look at 50 working years of paying an  extra 1 per cent to support reforms in aged care, said we should do it. Should we do it?

Richard Colbeck:

Look, we clearly need to reform the sector. There's no question about that.

Leon Compton:

But to the specific question, a 1 per cent extra levy, like a Medicare style levy to fund aged  care. Should we do it?

Richard Colbeck:

Media inquiries | Aaron Langmaid | 0456 889 018  Authorised by Senator Richard Colbeck, Tasmania





Well, that's one of the questions that we'll answer and you'll get the response to that in the  budget. Clearly, one of the major considerations of the reform of this sector is how we pay  for it and who pays. And it's clearly a big question. It’s [indistinct] question-

Leon Compton:

[Interrupts] Will you be recommending to the Prime Minister that we go down this path to  give you the money you need to start considering [indistinct]?

Richard Colbeck:

It's been a big question for a long time. I sat down with someone that you would know,  former Tasmanian Warwick Smith who was the minister in ‘97, when the last act came in and  the concept of bonds was first brought into place and Australians making a contribution  themselves to part of their aged care. So that remains one of the key debates that we will have  to have within the government as we lead up to our announcement in the budget.

Leon Compton:

Will you be recommending that 1 per cent levy?

Richard Colbeck:

I'll have more conversations in the room, but clearly, significant additional resources are  going to be required to conduct the reforms that we need to make to this sector. And the  Prime Minister’s acknowledged that; I've acknowledged that and I do it again today.

Leon Compton:

A final question on a different matter, and I think you might have reasonably expected this  question this morning. You just heard in ABC News that there is an expectation a cabinet  minister facing historic- an historic rape allegation, will speak today. Can you confirm that  that is going to happen?

Richard Colbeck:

The only thing that I've seen is the reports in the media, Leon. I have nothing over and above  that that I can offer you, unfortunately.

Leon Compton:

Are you expecting that that minister will speak today about the historic allegation?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, that's what's- that's what I've been told through the media. I don't have any other formal  indication of that or otherwise. You know, there's been a lot said about this over recent times  and obviously-

Leon Compton:

Media inquiries | Aaron Langmaid | 0456 889 018  Authorised by Senator Richard Colbeck, Tasmania





Can I ask you a personal question about it, Minister?

Richard Colbeck:

Sure.

Leon Compton:

You're of a certain age. You're a man in cabinet. What has it felt like since these allegations  have aired over the past, let's say, six or seven days? This allegation has aired over the past  six or seven days. What’s it been like for you? Have people been asking you the question?

Richard Colbeck:

Well, I've certainly had some fairly unattractive emails come to me. But the whole question  around personal conduct within Canberra and Parliament House over the last few weeks has  really put a pall over the place. It's really quite disturbing, concerning. When I heard what  had happened to Britney Higgins, for example, my heart just sank for her. And it really is a  very, very difficult circumstance for us all because nobody wants to see those sorts of  activities going on in their workplace, doesn't matter what workplace it is, you just don't want  to see those sorts of things occurring.

So it has cast a pall over the place. And, you know, we've just been talking about, as you say,  one of the most significant reforms of a policy area in a long time. I would prefer to be able  to have my complete focus on dealing with that rather than these other things that have been  part of the news cycle over recent times.

Leon Compton:

I appreciate you coming down this morning. It's good to see you.

Richard Colbeck:

Thanks, Leon.
