COVIDSAFE APP: $4 MILLION DOLLARS PER CONTACT TRACED



Under questioning today, Department of Health officials confirmed the COVIDSafe app has only  been used to trace 17 unique cases that were not otherwise identified by manual contact tracing.

The Government has spent up to $70 million on the COVIDSafe app, (most of it on marketing), for  17 traces.

This is $4 million dollars per unique contact.

Australia has had 27,520 recorded cases of COVID-19 - presumably having had hundreds of  thousands of contacts.

Yet the COVIDSafe app has on its own tracked down just 17.

This is despite seven million COVIDSafe app downloads and registrations.

Prime Minister Morrison has said “downloading the app is like putting on sunscreen to go out into the  sun. It gives us protection as a nation. It protects you, it protects your family, it protects your loved  ones, it protects our health workers, and it protects your job”.

Morrison’s marketing of the COVIDSafe app is wildly inconsistent with its delivery.

No one would use sunscreen with this level of effectiveness.

COVID-19 has had disastrous impacts on our nation’s health and economy.

Labor is supportive of any tool to alleviate this burden and get to COVID normal.

But this app has been a huge bungle.

The Liberals call themselves good economic managers, but they buy land worth $3 million for $30

million, and spend up to $70 million on an app to trace 17 people.

All the while accumulating a trillion-dollar deficit.

The Government needs to put its money where its mouth is, and tell the Australian people how they  are going to make this app work.
