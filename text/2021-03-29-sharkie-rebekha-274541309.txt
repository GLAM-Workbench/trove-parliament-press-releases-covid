MP CALLS FOR TAX RELIEF  FOR LOCAL DISTILLERS  Federal Member for Mayo Rebekha Sharkie met with the Treasurer last week to advocate for a  fairer tax regime on Australia’s local craft distillers to be included in the Federal Budget.

The meeting followed debate in Federal Parliament on a motion calling for a cut in the excise  tax rate on spirits, a freeze on indexed tax hikes for three years, and an increase in an excise

refund scheme for small distillers in line with what is available to small winemakers.

"Given the impact of COVID-19 on our hospitality industry, it makes practical sense to support

our local craft distillers," Rebekha said.

"At present, the Government is taxing the lifeblood out of this industry.

“It is simply absurd that our spirits distillers are subjected to the third-highest spirits tax in the  world.

“They are taxed four times more than wine and cider producers and twice as much as brewers in  Australia.”

Distillers say the tax regimen hurts their competitiveness and ability to grow and create jobs.

One of the biggest issues is distillers have to pay excise to the Government well before they are

paid for the product.

A winemaker sells its product to a wholesaler who is taxed when they onsell.

Modelling commissioned by the industry shows the tax on spirits is now so high it is having a  perverse impact on consumer behaviour with Australians buying fewer local products because of

the higher price.

Rebekha said the tax regime on spirits was a legacy from the time when the vast majority of hard

liquor was imported from overseas and the Government was attempting to establish the local  wine and brandy industry.

“We all recognise the importance of the wine sector in regional Australia and the significance the  industry has for our international reputation for quality," Rebekha said.

“In recent years, we have witnessed the development of craft breweries and distilleries.

“A decade ago, we did not have a single commercial distillery in Mayo. Today, more than a

dozen craft distilleries operate and, like their wine cousins, are among some of the best in the  world, producing some of the finest craft gin and whisky on offer.

“There are more than 300 locally owned distilleries across Australia, supporting more than 5,000  direct jobs and a further 15,000 indirect jobs.

“This growth has occurred despite the inequitable application of the spirits excise causing  unnecessary financial burdens on hardworking Australians.

“Most people don't realise that, when they go to a winery and at the cellar door they are poured a  sample, that sample is excise free—there is no tax paid on that for the producer.

“However, if you go to a gin distillery door, they need to pay excise on that small taste that you  have—bottle after bottle.

“That’s in addition to the tax they have to pay upfront for products such as whiskey that has to  age in a barrel. Some products are taxed eight times before being sold.

“It is costing our distillers a fortune just to keep the doors open.

“The changes for craft distillers put to Treasurer last week just bring the sector in line with what is

available to small winemakers.

“We received a positive hearing from the Treasurer and I remain hopeful that the Government

will consider these changes in the context of the 2021/22 Budget in May.”

Wine tax regime:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The wine tax (Wine Equalisation Tax) is based on value not volume (for example a

bottle of Grange pays considerably more tax than cask wine).

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  It’s based on 29% of the wholesale price of the product (in the example below, I’ve

used half retail price method, which is a common measure to show how the tax is  applied as wholesale prices are rarely published)

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  It is generally only payable if you are registered or required to be registered for GST.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  It's designed to be paid on the last wholesale sale of wine, which is usually between

the wholesaler and retailer.

Spirits tax regime:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The current spirits excise rate is $87.68 per pure litre of alcohol (note: Most products

such as gin, are distilled down to 40 per cent before being released to market).

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The spirits tax is payable 21 days from when the product leaves the distillery for sale.

This is a cause of huge cash flow issues for distillers as they are generally paying tax

before they receive payment from wholesalers and retailers (for example, Dan  Murphy’s sales terms are 90 days).
