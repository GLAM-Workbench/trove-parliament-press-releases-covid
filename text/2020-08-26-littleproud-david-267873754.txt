TRANSCRIPT

PARLIAMENT HOUSE PRESS CONFERENCE  26 August 2020





E&OE

Subjects: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Review;

WITH: HON. DAVID LITTLEPROUD MP, MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE, DROUGHT & EMERGENCY  MANAGEMENT & MEMBER FOR MARANOA.

DAVID LITTLEPROUD

Today is a very important day for Australian agriculture. Today we are announcing that the ACCC will  undertake a review, firstly, into the dairy code of conduct to investigate whether it should now be  extended from the farm gate to processors through to the supermarkets to continue to make sure  that there is fairness for our dairy farmers. But while we are doing that, we are also now going to  extend it to all perishable agricultural goods - that is seafood, eggs, chicken, meat, horticulture, to  make sure that there is fairness in the market.

The National Party believes in free trade, believes in markets, but we believe in fair markets. We are  making sure that after continued evidence and claims by farmers that they have been mistreated by  the processing sector and the supermarkets - it is time for us to clear that up. This is not going to go  on forever. This is a three-month inquiry and we are saying to farmers that you can have confidence  to come forward and to give your evidence in confidence to the ACCC where supermarkets and  processors will not know that you have done it. You can have the confidence that it will be held in  confidence and then once we are able to understand the extent of what the problem is, quantify and  validate it, then we will consider what the next step may be.

And that may be an agricultural perishable code of conduct that gives them protection. This isn’t  about regulating prices, this is just fair prices, a fair go for everybody. I do not think we should be  frightened that this will put pressure at the supermarket checkout.  This just means that when  farmers go and negotiate with supermarkets that it is done in an equitable way, that there is  guidelines for everyone to note.  There will be no increased regulatory burden.  We will simply be  making sure that the rules are clear.







Everyone plays by it, but if someone steps out and uses their market power against the goodwill and  the nature of those negotiations then there has to be consequences. So I just say to the agricultural  sector, this is about protecting you in a sensible way that is not over the top, making sure that we  can continue to grow agriculture in a fair way.  Not in a regulated way. This will not be a regulation  crisis.  This is simply making sure that you get fair prices. That is the Australian way and that is the  National Party way.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, it’s great to be here with the Deputy Leader of the National Party and the hardworking  Agriculture Minister, David Littleproud. This is an important milestone day because the ACCC is going  to do a body of work - a three-month inquiry - as the Agriculture Minister has just indicated, to  ensure that there is fairness in this sector. We want our farmers who have always been price takers,  not necessarily price makers, to get a fair go.

Of course, consumers who go to the supermarket, they also want to know that there’s going to be  continuity of supply.  They also want to know that Australian farmers are being given a fair go when  it comes to producing the fine produce that consumers so readily rely on.  We know that in the  National Party that this is important policy work. We know that it is an important delivery outcome.

We have worked with the Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, to bring this about. David and the team have  worked so hard to ensure that it has been brought about. And one of the things that I am so pleased  about is that the farmers are going to have confidentiality arrangements when they do, if they do,  provide advice, provide claims, provide evidence to this inquiry.  This is so important, to be able to  do it in such a way that it won’t impinge upon their future work, their future outcomes is such an  important thing for those farmers.

I spoke to one of the largest dairy procedures in my own electorate, Simone Jolliffe who, with her  husband, Neil, have 250 cows at Euberta.  She welcomes the announcement today.  She welcomes  what the Nationals and the Government are doing.  She has been a head of dairy’s peak body, one of  the peak bodies, for some time. She has experience in that regard, so she knows what it’s like at an  organisational level.  She knows what it’s like when you’re down there milking the cows early in the  morning and all she and her colleagues want is a fair price for their labour, for their sweat. And I  know that this inquiry in dairy, in grocery and perishables is going to be so important for her and so  many other people right across the nation.

JOURNALIST

What kind of underhand tactics do you think has gone on in some of these other industries, like  horticulture as well?











MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, what we want to do is make sure that there is fairness of price, fairness of delivery and fairness  of outcomes.  And so whatever has gone on in the past, well, we want to make sure that it doesn’t  go on in the future. And so that’s why there are those confidential arrangements put in place so that  if people do have claims and allegations, that they can bring them forward in a way that is not going  to harm their outcomes in the future.  So let’s see what comes about from this inquiry.  The ACCC, it  is going to do this body of work and if there are things that are found to be, as you’ve just said,  underhanded, well that will be stamped out.

JOURNALIST

Minister, just following on from that question, I think everyone’s pretty across what’s going on in the  dairy industry, but what’s going on with those other perishables?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, what we’re going to see through this three-month inquiry is just that - if there are things going  on in other perishables, in meat and all the other outcomes that David Littleproud has just indicated  - eggs, poultry, whatever the case might be - then we want to hear about it.  The ACCC wants that  evidence to be able to form their decision-making as part of this process of getting a fair price for  farmers.

JOURNALIST

If you are ruling out regulation what are you suggesting that you might do at the end of this inquiry  to address some of these imbalances?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, as always, we will take on board the ACCC’s advice and David Littleproud as the Minister, the  appropriate Minister, will act upon it. And if things aren’t as they ought to be, well then there’ll be  penalties, there will be repercussions.

JOURNALIST

Can you give any more details?

DAVID LITTLEPROUD

This has been a long time in the making because we continue to hear from farmers through Senate  inquiries or through evidence to the ACCC, you know, the big supermarkets have used their market  power to get them into contracts and then to pull them out from under their nose after they’ve  made significant investments, capital investments that have then sent them broke and so what this  is about is fairness and about acting in good faith.





So there is currently already a horticultural code of conduct and there’s a dairy code of conduct that  only goes from farm gate to the processor.  The processors tell us of that some of the challenges that  they have to put pressure back on the farm gate is growing into actions of the supermarkets.  So this  is also an opportunity for processors to come forward and talk about what supermarkets have done  to them.

JOURNALIST

So will you extend the code to supermarkets, is that what you’re -

DAVID LITTLEPROUD

Well, there already is a voluntary grocery code of conduct, but let me just say that that is voluntary  and the fines are very small.  And it is designed for big companies like Nestle and Unilever to be able  to have and act in negotiating in good faith with the supermarkets.  It doesn’t protect small family  farms. They don’t have the financial means if they have been wronged to test that in a court of law.

What we are saying is we need to create a framework, if there is evidence that we can validate that  supermarkets have mistreated farmers in some of their actions, we can work through that and that  we may get to a juncture whereby a perishable goods code of conduct with supermarkets is created.   That will be up to the ACCC, but that may be one of the mechanisms that they recommend. And this  is not simply putting regulations but putting guidelines around the supermarkets and how they  should treat and how they should act in good faith in negotiations with farmers to make sure they  don’t abuse market power.  They’re about 67 per cent of the grocery market at the moment, the big  two supermarkets, so they wield a lot of power. And when you are a little small family farmer, you  don’t have the financial means or resources in which to protect yourself.  And Government shouldn’t  interfere in marketplaces, they should simply make sure that the guidelines are there to protect  everyone, that there is fairness and that is what we are trying to ascertain the extent of any  misappropriate behaviour by anyone through the supply chain against those family farms. They are  the backbone of regional Australia. They are the backbone of the agricultural sector. This is not  doing anything other than making sure there is fairness and a level playing field.

JOURNALIST

Deputy Prime Minister, just on the National Press Club today, the Deputy Head of Mission from  China is going to be appearing. On the menu we’ve got wagyu, we’ve got barley and we’ve got a  shiraz from McLaren Vale.  Is it good that we showcase some Aussie products that the Chinese  market may be missing out on?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, absolutely and as always, the Chinese are our largest trading partner and it’s always good to  showcase Australia’s fine products, whether it’s wines, whether it’s beef, whatever the case might  be.  I’m sure that some of those products probably emanate from Maranoa and Riverina, two fine  electorates producing food and fibre that is the envy of the world.  And there’s something that I





know China as our largest trading partner also recognises and acknowledges that Australian food  and Australian fibre is something that they can’t do without. We need China as much as China needs  us. I have said that all along.  We want to make sure that we continue trading with our largest  trading partner because our farmers would want nothing else.

JOURNALIST

Do you think China’s increasingly hostile language towards Australia is a mistake?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

We will always work through relationships with China in a diplomatic fashion, as we always do.  As I  say, there are 149 billion reasons why we need to continue those relationships with China.  They’ve  got a bourgeoning middle class. They want our protein and we’re there ready and willing to give it to  them.

JOURNALIST

Are you concerned they’re targeting Australia’s agricultural sector?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, we will always work through these things in a diplomatic fashion. I know the Trade Minister,  Simon Birmingham, is working very hard to make sure that not only the trade we’ve already got in  existing arrangements is there for the future but to build on those, not just with China but with  other nations as well. And that’s why that work with the international freight assistance mechanism  has been put in place through COVID-19 to ensure that we can look at other markets. That we can,  whether it’s a Geraldton lobster or sheep meat from Victoria, or whatever the case might be, that  we get it out, not only to China but to other markets as well.

JOURNALIST

Minister, did you say yesterday that you couldn’t lie and say you never had ambitions to lead the  Nationals. Mr McCormack, how do you feel about that?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, we’re here together. I mean, we’re great mates. David and I have been mates ever since we  got into the Parliament together when David was first elected and we will continue to do that.  But  the focus for David and I, as you have seen today, is the people that we serve, the people we  represent, those hardworking farmers who get up every morning at the crack of dawn - even before  it - to grow the food and fibre that our nation and other nations need. That’s the focus of David  Littleproud. That’s the focus of Michael McCormack. That’s the focus of every one of The Nationals  in Government. That will continue to be our focus going forward.





JOURNALIST

Do you see him as your successor?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, look, that will be a matter for the party room. I’ve always said that the leadership of the  National Party is a matter for the party room. I am humbled to be the Leader of the National Party, I  know David is humbled to serve as the Deputy Leader of the National Party.  They are positions that  have served our party well for a hundred years. The National Party, through its forebears the  Country Party, have served regional people and the nation well for a hundred years.  And you know  what?  We’ll be there for the next hundred years too. David and I won’t be there for the next  hundred years, but we’re going to be here for a long, long time to come serving our people, serving  our nation in the best interests of regional Australia.

JOURNALIST

You’ve constantly told your colleagues to stop backgrounding, put your name to it. They’re still doing  it. What does that say about your ability to unite the party?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, our party is united and we’re here today, David and I making an announcement that I know the  National Party are very pleased about.  I know the National Party have fought hard for this outcome.   We always fight for fairness for farmers, for fairness for prices. And we will always do that, for and  on behalf of regional Australia. Let’s leave the personality and the politics aside. The people in  regional Australia do not want to think that politicians are talking about themselves. They want to  know that we’re there representing the interests of regional Australia and David and I and the rest of  the Nationals team always are.

JOURNALIST

Have they ever questioned your ability to lead, your constituents?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

No, I don’t believe so. I mean, I’m not going to get 100 per cent of the vote in the Riverina. You only  have to get 50 per cent plus one. I am very, very pleased and humbled that they have sent me to  Parliament four times to serve their interests. And I know that the people of the Riverina are pleased  that I am in there, fighting hard for and on behalf of their interests each and every day of every  week. And I know that the people of Maranoa are just as pleased to have David Littleproud  representing their interests. But it is a greater challenge as well.  It is also in the national interest.   And there are wonderful opportunities.  I said just the other day, there are jobs in regional Australia  if people just go and look for them and not just in the agricultural and mining sectors.  There are so  many jobs in regional Australia and for those people who are living in cities, bursting at the seams,





for those people who want a fresher and brighter outlook, go to a regional centre. Have a look.   There are jobs there. There are opportunities waiting. Regional Australia is big enough in which to  get a good cup of coffee and it’s small enough to still care.

JOURNALIST

Mr McCormack, do you think if public money is being spent on manufacturing that it should be spent  in Australia, paying Australians?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, I know Karen Andrews is doing a great job in having an industry blueprint for the future for the  post-COVID world in which we will eventually live in. And I know that she’s working very hard with  the Small Business Minister, Michaelia Cash, to boost manufacturing, working with The Nationals, of  course because we know how important manufacturing is to our nation’s relief and recovery efforts  out the back of COVID-19.

And, of course, we are spending a lot of money on manufacturing here, but of course, there are  many businesses, too, which feed into Australian input, which feed into Australian manufacturing  which may well be based offshore.  But what we want to do is make sure that we get best value for  taxpayers’ dollars and that’s what we do for every decision made around the Cabinet table around  which David and I sit and around which David and I make decisions for and on behalf of not just  regional Australia, but in the national interest.

JOURNALIST

Are we at the point where we need to mandate things like trains being built in Australia, especially in  the regions where youth unemployment is up around 20 per cent in some places?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, again, you have to have the skilled labour force to do it in Australia, too.  And that’s why we’re  working on blueprints all the time. That’s why we’re investing so heavily in skills. I had a meeting  with the Prime Minister just this morning and David was at it as well, where we were focused on  skills and focused on making sure that whether it’s through TAFE, whether it’s through small  business, that we improve the skills regime of Australians. I know Dan Tehan and Andrew Gee have  been working so hard to make our graduates from university job ready when they come out and get  their tertiary degrees so that there are jobs for there for them for the future.  And we will continue  to do that.  We will continue to work hard through this pandemic every day, of every week and every  night too, to make sure that we get the best outcomes for Australians. And David and I will be in  there focused particularly on regional Australia.

JOURNALIST

Will you lead the National Party to the next election?





MICHAEL McCORMACK

Yes.

JOURNALIST

Keith Pitt said this morning that you were his leader and he was ambitious for you, that’s the kiss of  death around here isn’t it?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, I’m glad that Keith’s ambitious for me. I’m sure he’s also ambitious for the people that he  represents in Hinkler. I’m sure that he’s representing that fine state of Queensland.  What we need  in Queensland - and Keith knows it and David knows it, he comes from Queensland too - is for those  border restrictions to be eased, for practical solutions to border management so that our farmers  can get their equipment over the border. These border issues are really affecting our aviation sector.   hit first, hit hardest by COVID-19. What we need to do, is have the border restrictions lifted and  eased such that we can get planes back in the air, such that we can get tourism, agriculture, every  other sector, firing again. This is just common sense.

JOURNALIST

I guess the question is also then for Minister Littleproud, are you ambitious for your leader or do you  have your own ambitions?

DAVID LITTLEPROUD

I mean, these silly games just have to stop. I mean, this is just a story created by some bored  journalist, bored about reporting on COVID-19.  Now you might be bored about reporting on COVID-19, but we’re not. These are real Australians’ lives that we’re playing with and we are trying to deal  with.  And I just think that everyone just needs to take a cold shower and get back to what we’re  here for, which is focusing on them. The National Party is not changing their leader.  We are getting  on with the job. So, you know what, it might give you some titillation while we’re here but we don’t  give a rats. We are simply focused on regional Australia. We are delivering today for farmers. We  delivered for regional Australia this week for the education sector. And Michael and I stood up and  made sure that those farmers who were egregiously impacted by that live trade decision didn’t have  to go through an appeal. That’s what the National Party is achieving in under two months, because  of this leader and the others in the Cabinet. So, you know what, you can titillate all you like. We’ve  had a gutful. We’re going to focus on those people out there, not you, not your silly games, but just  work for them.

JOURNALIST

It’s not us though, it’s your colleagues that are backgrounding, again.





DAVID LITTLEPROUD

Well, good luck to them.

JOURNALIST

Who do you think is doing it though?

DAVID LITTLEPROUD

You’re the ones in the know. We don’t really care. We’re focused on outcomes. The Australian public  want outcomes and they want us to deliver them. The National Party has just delivered three major  outcomes in the last two months. Now that’s a functioning party that is really delivering for their  constituency and I’m very proud to be the deputy leader of a party that is actually making a  difference in the lives of rural and regional Australians.

JOURNALIST

Just on the ACCC inquiry, you’ve had your issues with the big supermarkets over the years. Have you  had a discussion with them about this inquiry and what do you expect their reaction to be?

DAVID LITTLEPROUD

I couldn’t care less what the response is.

JOURNALIST

So you haven’t talked to them?

DAVID LITTLEPROUD

No. I’ll leave that to the Treasurer. I represent the agriculture sector and when they come to me with  grievances that they haven’t been fairly treated, my job’s to stand up for them. And that’s what I’ve  done today and that’s what the National Party’s done today. Supermarkets are big enough and ugly  enough to look after themselves. But let me say, they are the ones that created this culture,  particularly in the dairy industry, destroying the livelihoods of so many dairy farmers across this  country with this dollar a litre of milk stuff that I broke. We we’re having some pretty tough  conversations with the CEO’s 18 months ago and I’m not against people making profits but you have  to do it fairly. That’s all farmers want. They’re not a charity.  They just want a fair go and what the  National Party is about is putting in that environment and giving them a fair go. I think that’s the  Australian way and I don’t think anyone out there would begrudge what the National Party has  achieved today.  I think they’d say this is the right thing, the right thing not just for rural and regional  Australia, not just for farmers but for everybody. That’s our nation, that’s a fair nation and we live by  those principles.
