LITTLEPROUD’S FARM LABOUR SHORTAGE HITS THE HIP POCKET



The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES)

forecast predicting a sharp rise in the price of fruit and vegetables underscores the growing

cost of Minister Littleproud’s failure to address farm labour shortages.



According to ABARES, farm labour shortages will hit production, hurting farmers and causing

prices of fruit and vegetables to increase 7-29 per cent.



Under the Morrison Government, wages are flat but the cost of living just keeps going up.



These stark figures must force action. It’s time Minister Littleproud took responsibility for this

issue and showed some leadership.



Minister Littleproud should stop passing the buck. The cost of crop losses has already reached

$45 million.



The Morrison Government has failed to take responsibility for labour shortages. Farmers just

want this fixed.



The Morrison Government is still yet to release or respond to the recommendations of a critical

agriculture workforce strategy report it received last year.



It’s unacceptable that, despite huge losses on farms across the country, the Minister has yet to

release the report.





Labor has written to Minister Littleproud calling for him to finally step up and respond to this

report with a real plan to address gaps in Australia’s agriculture workforce.



Minister Littleproud and the Nationals are more interested in shameless politicking than

showing leadership for Australian farmers.



Restrictions related to COVID-19 have highlighted longstanding issues in Australia’s

agriculture workforce, which is why action is needed now.



The Morrison Government must do better for Aussie farmers and consumers.
