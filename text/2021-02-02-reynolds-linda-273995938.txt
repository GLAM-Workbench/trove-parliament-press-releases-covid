Australian Government Bushfire Support for WA



Communities in Western Australia remain under threat from the Wooroloo bushfire,  currently burning out of control in the Perth region.

Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management David Littleproud said  weather conditions have been hampering firefighting efforts.

“The Australian Government has acted swiftly to support the Western Australian  Government’s response,” Minister Littleproud said.

Minister for Defence, Senator the Hon Linda Reynolds CSC said arrangements are  underway for the Australian Defence Force to transport fire retardant to WA.

“Emergency Management Australia, at the request of WA authorities, has asked Defence  to deliver fire retardant via airlift from RAAF Richmond to Busselton Margaret River Airport.  Defence is working through the details now so the fire retardant can be delivered to  directly support firefighting efforts,” Minister Reynolds said.

“Defence stands ready to provide additional support at the request of the WA Government  as these fires burn out of control.

“Defence is well-equipped to provide assistance at the request of states and territories,  which was demonstrated last year as ADF men and women directly supported  communities throughout Australia during the Black Summer bushfires.

“This latest support is in addition to the hundreds of ADF personnel currently deployed  across the country, including more than 150 in Western Australia, assisting with the  Government’s response to COVID-19.”

The Australian Government Disaster Response Plan—COMDISPLAN—has been  activated to enable the movement of the fire retardant to support the efforts of Western  Australian firefighters.

“Once again, our emergency services personnel are showing their professionalism and  dedication in the face of very difficult conditions,” Minister Littleproud said.
