INTERVIEW ON THE TODAY SHOW  4 February 2020

Subjects: Coronavirus;

ALLISON LANGDON

Well, more now on Melbourne's fresh COVID blow. Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack joins  us in Canberra. Good morning to you.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Good Morning.

ALLISON LANGDON

Look, another leak, possibly this dangerous UK strain. Hotel quarantine is a problem for us. What did  you think when you learnt of this last night?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Well, indeed and I know Daniel Andrews stood up very late last night and talked about the outbreak.  It is only one and hopefully - very, very hopefully - we will be able to ensure that the Victorian  Government and the health officials will be able to track and trace everywhere where that person  has been and to ensure that people who have been to similar locations can go and get tested  immediately and we can nip it in the bud.











ALLISON LANGDON

Michael, every outbreak we have seen has been linked to hotel quarantine. We know it is a problem.  It is your constitutional responsibility. We just had Professor Bill Bowtell on the show and he was  pretty strong on this that, you guys a year ago, the system you introduced was fine. It is not fine any  more. How are you working on it? Have you got a plan? He was talking about potentially looking at  Howard Springs in the Northern Territory.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Yes, we have got a plan. Minister Greg Hunt has been very diligent on this every day. We have taken  the best possible advice by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, working through  National Cabinet. I know that Professor Paul Kelly, the Chief Medical Officer, has been extremely,  extremely hard-working on this and making sure that we have got every provision in place. But  unfortunately, sadly, there will be outbreaks. Every day across the world there are half a million new  cases, community cases of COVID-19.

ALLISON LANGDON

Yes, but - sorry to interrupt there - we don't have community transmission in Australia -

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Because we have been very diligent.

ALLISON LANGDON

Until we get a leak from one of these quarantine hotels. It is a big, big problem and the one we have  just heard of overnight in Melbourne now means the Australian Open is in doubt. We have got limits  on how many people you can have at your house. Do you know if the Australian Open will go ahead  now?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

No, well that's going to be a matter for the Victorian Government and, of course, for Tennis  Australia. But I think right across Australia a tennis tournament is probably the last thing they are  thinking about. We just saw the fires in WA - very, very tragic for those people who have lost homes  - 71 properties affected and six firefighters injured, as I understand it and that's very, very sad. Of  course, we have got this case in Victoria where, of course, it has concerned the Premier, it has  concerned the entire state. Melburnians - Victorians indeed - are now facing new limitations and  restriction, as you would expect to be announced by the Victorian Premier. But I say again, no  system is going to be perfect. No system is going to be flawless. This is a disease and a virus which, of  course, has virulent strains. We are doing our very best and of course, we have changed to ensure  that there is testing prior to people coming to Australia. We have put in restrictions on people all the  way through and we have had one death in just several months. Of course, that is very sad for that -





that was an historic case - but that is very sad of course, for that family. But when you compare  what we have done as a country, 909 deaths compared to in other countries elsewhere where they  are getting almost two a minute, we have done very well. And we have done very well because  Australians have done largely the right thing. And I say to all of those Australians, thank you. We are  certainly not out of this yet and we certainly won't be for a long time. We have got the vaccine roll-out schedule very much planned and we are working through the Therapeutic Goods Administration  to do that with Pfizer, with AstraZeneca. We have not placed all our eggs in one basket. We have got  several different doses of the vaccine. We have got millions of those jabs. We will have them ready  to go, to be rolled out later this month. We are doing everything we can as a nation and I know the  State Governments are working hard, too.

ALLISON LANGDON

Look - there was a lot in that answer - I note this morning four European countries have now  banned the AstraZeneca vaccine for use in the elderly. Do you have a back-up plan for our  vulnerable?

MICHAEL McCORMACK

We will go through the TGA - the Therapeutic Goods Administration - and what they will tell us, we  will follow. We have always, right from the word go, we have taken the best possible medical advice  available and that's why Ally, we have kept Australia as COVID-free as possibly we could.

ALLISON LANGDON

All right. Thank you for joining us this morning, we really appreciate it and as we said, hopefully  Melbourne can get on top of this outbreak very quickly.

MICHAEL McCORMACK

Indeed, it is a pleasure.
