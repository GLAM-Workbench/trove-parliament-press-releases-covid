Update on novel coronavirus in Australia

Four cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have now been confirmed in Australia - one in  Victoria and three in New South Wales.

The first case was confirmed in Victoria yesterday, with the three in New South Wales  confirmed later in the day.

The Commonwealth Department of Health is in close contact with Victorian and NSW health  authorities and has notified the World Health Organization of the cases.

All four cases are men who flew to Australia on separate flights from China between 6  January and 20 January. All four had either spent time in Wuhan, China, or been in close  contact with someone from Wuhan.

The virus originated in mainland China, and the overwhelming majority of cases are there.  The only clear evidence of human-to-human transmission is in the Hubei province, where the  City of Wuhan is located.

Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, said NSW and Victorian authorities are taking all necessary  precautions to limit the transmission of the virus.

“Australia has processes in place to identify and treat cases such as the novel coronavirus,  including isolation facilities in each state and territory,” Minister Hunt said.

“Yesterday I convened a meeting of State and Territory Health Ministers to coordinate the  ongoing national action and response.”

“As a consequence the Government has written to doctors’ groups today to provide them with  updated information and advice.”

“The Commonwealth is working closely with Victoria and New South Wales to facilitate  contact tracing of individuals who may have been in contact with these men since they  arrived in Australia or on the relevant flights.”

“This will include contacting individuals in close contact with the four confirmed cases, and  providing other passengers with advice on what to do if they begin feeling unwell,” Minister  Hunt said.

Australian Chief Medical Officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, said Victorian and NSW  authorities had acted swiftly, following strict protocols.

“All four affected patients have been placed in isolation. I understand the men are stable and  doing well,” Professor Murphy said.

Professor Murphy also acknowledge that other cases may be confirmed in Australia over the  coming days or weeks.

“Symptoms include fever, coughing, sore throat, vomiting and difficulty breathing. Difficulty  breathing is a sign of possible pneumonia and requires immediate medical attention,”  Professor Murphy said.

In response to the emerging situation the Australian Government has taken immediate action  which has been based on the best available evidence and advice:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Minister Hunt convened a meeting of State and Territory Health Ministers on 25  January to coordinate the ongoing national action and response.  Ã¯ÂÂ· DFAT has raised the level of travel advice for Wuhan and Hubei Province in China to  ‘level 4 - do not travel’ and has issued a Smartraveller bulletin on the virus outbreak.

The advice level for China as a whole has not changed.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Border measures are already in place to detect travellers who are unwell coming into  the country.  Ã¯ÂÂ· While Chinese authorities have now stopped all traffic from Hubei province, as an

added precaution, the Australian Government is ensuring that all flights from other  parts of China will be met and all passengers provided with information on arrival.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Information is also on display at all major international ports around Australia, with  instructions on what to do if travellers have symptoms or if symptoms develop.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Human coronavirus with pandemic potential is now a Listed Human Disease under

the Biosecurity Act 2015, enabling the use of enhanced border measures.  Ã¯ÂÂ· The Department of Health has provided primary and community health care workers  and Emergency Departments in Australia with updated advice.

If people think they have been exposed to the novel coronavirus and have serious concerns  about their health, they should immediately contact their local health professional and they  can also ring healthdirect on 1800 022 222 to receive a health assessment by a registered  nurse.
