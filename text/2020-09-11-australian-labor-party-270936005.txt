MORRISON GOVERNMENT’S LACK OF JOBS PLAN FAILING YOUNG

AUSTRALIANS



Coronavirus has seen the number of people relying on unemployment

payments double.



But it seems young Australians are experiencing some of the most dramatic

changes in their circumstances, according to the latest Department of Social

Services data.



In the year to June 2020 the number of people relying on unemployment

payments increased by 110 per cent overall.



But the increase was 169 per cent for people aged 21-24 and 168 per cent for

people aged 25-34.





The largest cohorts of those on JobSeeker by age are 25 to 34 year olds

(367,570) and 35 to 44 year olds (301,633).



The Morrison Government plans to return JobSeeker to its old base rate of $40

per day.



This is the wrong time to be cutting payments, especially when the Government

doesn’t have a plan for jobs or a plan for the economy.



Snapping back JobSeeker and winding down JobKeeper are not plans for jobs

- measures from the Government that are no replacement for investing in jobs

and education .



This is yet another challenge disproportionately impacting young people during

the pandemic, and yet another reason the Morrison Government must urgently

implement a COVID-19 Youth Recovery Strategy.



Its failure to deliver a plan for jobs is leaving young Australians behind.
