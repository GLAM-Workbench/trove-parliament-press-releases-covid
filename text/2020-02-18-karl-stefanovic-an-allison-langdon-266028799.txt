KARL STEFANOVIC:

We're joined now by the Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton. Peter, good morning to  you.

PETER DUTTON:



Morning Karl.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

You've got to kind of feel for those people?

PETER DUTTON:



It's a terrible situation and obviously the Government wants to help them out of that  situation as quickly as possible. We want to bring them back to safety in our country, but we  also want to make sure that we protect Australians here.

I've just received advice this morning that there are now 454 cases off the ship and that's a  dramatic ramp up - another 99 cases overnight as I understand. So it's a very difficult  situation. We want to get people out of there as quickly as possible.

ALLISON LANGDON:

Yeah I mean, I think that what that shows us, the fact that you've got so many more new  cases being confirmed and we're hearing this daily is that this ship has actually been an

incubation den. I mean, should we have done more for the Aussies who are trapped on  board sooner? Or was there basically no other option than to let it play out as it has?

PETER DUTTON:



Well it's always hard unless you're on the ground there. But obviously the isolation  arrangements haven't worked and we're incredibly grateful though to the Japanese  Government for the support that they've provided to Australians that have been  hospitalised, that have been taken off the vessel.

We're going to uplift people on Wednesday - tomorrow - but we're not going to bring  people on to the plane who have a confirmed case of the coronavirus. We're going to make  sure that those people can receive the medical attention in the Japanese health system so  that they're isolated and that gives us the best chance of making sure that we don't spread  the virus when people come back to Australia as well.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

You can't be certain though, can you? I mean, given 99 more cases overnight, you can't be  certain that these people don't have or haven't been infected though given the incubation  period?

PETER DUTTON:



You're right. Some people could be carriers and they could be in that incubation stage and  that's why we've taken the difficult decision - because I know these people want to get back  home to see their families as quickly as possible - to make sure that we can isolate these  people in much better arrangements than they've had in confined spaces on the vessel.

But we need to do that. It's been effective on both Christmas Island and in Darwin and we  want to make sure - particularly given that this is a group where older Australians, people  over 70, over 80 years of age make up this cohort that we're bringing home - we want to  make sure that they're healthy and safe and that they're not spreading the virus to their  families.

So you're right Karl, it's a very difficult situation, but I think the Prime Minister's made  exactly the right call.

ALLISON LANGDON:

Yeah I think the people we were just chatting to on board are very understanding of the  predicament they're in.

Minister, do you regret spending $2 billion to keep Holden afloat when the company just  turned around and dumped on its workers and us?

PETER DUTTON:



Well Ally, I think it's really disappointing and I think a lot of people are shattered. All of us  grew up as Ford or Holden families. I was a Ford family. So it was a bad thing to hop into Mr  Johnson's Commodore next door. But that was the era in which we grew up, right? So it's  devastating for those families.

And yes, we've put a lot of money in to make sure that that company can continue to  employ Australians and produce a product. But if you look at your own family make-up now  where people have got cars from different markets and companies all over the world, it's  just a different environment than it was in the '70s or '80s.

ALLISON LANGDON:

Well I'm still reeling from the fact he's a Ford guy.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

No, no. He was Mr Johnson's car next door, but he had a what car? Dick Johnson's or what?

PETER DUTTON:



He had a Commodore. It wasn't Dick Johnson unfortunately. He wasn't leading a double life  at that time. But it was a five-speed Commodore. That was a pretty impressive vehicle which  I can admit now. I never did then.

ALLISON LANGDON:

But with all that money that we taxpayers gave them, how is it that we didn't get some sort  of commitment from General Motors to remain open in Australia? And where did all of that  money go?

PETER DUTTON:



Well Ally, if you look back at Mitsubishi for example, there are other examples where we've  provided industry assistance. There have been tax breaks for research and development.  And a lot of the companies have really done quite well in our market because, whilst we've  got a high wage cost, they've been able to invest into that research and development piece.  And I think we've added a lot of value to these companies over a period of time, which  ultimately has resulted in many thousands of Australians being employed.

So we've had a significant return on our investment in that sense. People have paid back  into the tax system and we've been part of growing that research and development sector  here which is really very important. And it bleeds into other areas as well, not just the  automotive industry, and we've got a return on our investment there.

But I think people are bitterly disappointed. None more than the people who were involved  in the dealer networks, in production, in every part of the Holden business. We didn't want  this outcome, but I think it's a global reality when you look at what's happening out of  China, out of other markets now where many cheaper vehicles are being made and  consumers are wanting to buy those cheaper products or a different product than what  Holden's able to provide.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Pete, just on another matter really quickly before we move on, Dustin Martin's dad. Given  the High Court's decision last week that Aboriginal people can't be deported on character  grounds, will you be letting him back in the country at any point?

PETER DUTTON:



No we won't Karl. We've been very clear about making sure that we can keep Australia safe  and part of the reason that we kick out people with severe criminal histories like Mr Martin  is that we want to make sure that people don't commit crimes again in our country. And if  you come to our country as a New Zealand citizen…

KARL STEFANOVIC:

…can you do that legally? Can you do that legally?

PETER DUTTON:



Absolutely. Under the Migration Act, we've now cancelled the visas of about 5,000 people,  many of them involved in outlaw motorcycle gangs, who are the biggest distributors of  amphetamines, ice in our country, destroying young lives.

And it's a very clear message that if you come to our country as a Kiwi, as a US citizen, as a  citizen of anywhere else in the world, and you commit crimes in our country then you can  expect to be deported.

I think he's got a spurious claim, but that's a claim for him to put. It will be tested and the  advice I've got is that he, along with many others, don't deserve to be in our country and  that's why they've had their visas cancelled.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Peter Dutton, thank you so much for your time today. Appreciate it. Busy day.

PETER DUTTON:



Thanks guys.
