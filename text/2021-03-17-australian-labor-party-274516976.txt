TIME TO END WORD GAMES ON WOMEN’S SAFETY

It’s time Scott Morrison stopped playing politics with women’s safety and ruled out once and for  all his plan to get domestic violence victims to use their superannuation to escape abusive  relationships.

His Minister for Superannuation Jane Hume told the ABC’s Fran Kelly this morning: “If there is  a chance it will put women at risk, then we won’t proceed with the measure.”

If, as the Minister claims, the Morrison Government has spent “years” consulting with  stakeholders about its plan, Scott Morrison would know there is more than a chance of being  put at risk.

He would know that many women in abusive relationships have already been violently coerced  into handing over their super through his poorly conceived COVID early access to super  scheme.

He would know that women’s superannuation nest eggs already lag far behind men’s.

He would know financial security is already the number one barrier to women leaving abusive  situations.

Scott Morrison’s desperate political fix will do harm and “reviewing” it is not enough to assure  at-risk women that they will not be asked to provide for their own safety by running down their  financial security.

He must commit to what stakeholders and Labor have been asking for for years: Proper



funding for housing and support services and paid domestic violence leave for every worker in  Australia.
