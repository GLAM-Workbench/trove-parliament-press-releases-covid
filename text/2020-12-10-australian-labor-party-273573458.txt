TOURISM HIT HARDER THAN MOST, BUT LEFT BEHIND BY MORRISON

GOVERNMENT



New Tourism figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics again highlight how

devastating the past twelve months have been for the sector.



Operators who were still recovering from bushfires were among the first and most

severely impacted businesses when the COVID-19 pandemic hit - ongoing

international travel restrictions mean they are likely to among the last to recover.



Today’s new statistics confirm that tourism has been disproportionately impacted

by last summer’s devastating bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic, compared

with the broader economy.



For the first time in 16 years, all recorded measures show tourism far worse off

than the economy overall.

But the Morrison Government has failed to provide a plan to protect jobs or any

targeted support for this vital industry and things will only get worse as JobKeeper

and JobSeeker payments are wound back.



The hit tourism has taken has slashed its contribution to the Australian economy to

just 2.5 per cent of Gross Value Added in 2019/20, the smallest proportion the

sector has contributed in the past 16 years.



Tourism has already suffered significant job losses, shedding some 136,500 jobs.



That’s 136,500 Australians out of work in the tourism sector since December last

year - around one in seven jobs lost in 2020.



It is way past time for Simon Birmingham and Scott Morrison to tell the over one

million Australians employed in the tourism sector what their plan is to support the

industry and save their jobs.





The Government must deliver a clear plan to support the entire sector through this

crisis, preventing hundreds of thousands more jobs being lost and ensuring that

operators survive to drive our national economic recovery into the future.
