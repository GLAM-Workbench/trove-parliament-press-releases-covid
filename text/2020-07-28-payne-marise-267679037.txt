AUSMIN 2020 Global Health Security  Statement  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Joint Statement

28 July 2020 Minister for Foreign Affairs, The Hon Marise Payne MP

The text of the following statement is released by the Governments of the  United States of America and Australia regarding progress towards health  security cooperation to be discussed at the 2020 Australia-U.S. Ministerial  Consultations (AUSMIN) to be held on 28 July.

“At no other time in recent history has collaboration been more critical to prevent,  prepare and respond to the collective threat posed by infectious diseases and  pandemics. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of the United  States and Australia are taking joint action to prevent, detect, and respond to  infectious disease threats, including those of zoonotic (animal) origin particularly the  Indo-Pacific region. COVID-19 is just one example of the rising trend of diseases  caused by viruses that have jumped from animal hosts into the human population.  The bilateral partnership between the U.S. Department of State and the Australian  Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) remains vital to preventing the risks  of future infectious diseases outbreaks and pandemics and their devastating health,  economic and social costs.

Recognising that much pivotal work remains to be done to strengthen and accelerate  capacity building for health security in the Indo-Pacific, the United States and  Australia remain deeply committed to transparency, accountability and collaboration  in this area. This includes commitment to a One Health approach that fosters  cooperation between environmental conservation, human health, animal health and  plant health.

On the occasion of AUSMIN 2020, and in support of the goals of the United States  Global Health Security Strategy and Australia’s Health Security Initiative for the Indo-Pacific region, our two governments reaffirm our strong partnership, and welcome  strengthened cooperation throughout 2020 and beyond, by way of a joint plan of  activities including:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Virtually co-convening a second Southeast Asia Health Security Donor

Coordination Meeting in 2020;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Exploring opportunities to collaboratively build Indo-Pacific partner

capacity in biosecurity, biosafety, and bio-surveillance to prevent, detect,  and respond to infectious disease outbreaks caused by especially dangerous

pathogens, through laboratory placements for participants from the Greater  Mekong Subregion in Australian research institutions, as well as joint  biosafety training;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Working together in third party countries to improve hygiene conditions, stop

the selling of high risk wildlife in ‘wet markets’, and immediately encourage  the enforcement of laws addressing the sale of illegal wildlife in all markets.  This includes support to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United  Nations (FAO) to develop a targeted risk assessment and mitigation plan  for identified wet markets in Indonesia to reduce risks of zoonotic disease  spillover events;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Exploring collaboration between the Indo-Pacific Centre for Health Security

(CHS)’s implementing partners and the upcoming USAID Strategies to  Prevent (STOP) Spillover program as well as an upcoming USAID private  sector engagement program to identify and help partner governments  mitigate zoonotic disease spillover risks with pandemic potential in the region,  including through support for market solutions in the prevention of zoonosis  and antimicrobial resistance along the livestock value chain;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Extending collaborative support for a three-year program to strengthen

community pandemic preparedness in Indonesia through the Red Cross in  Indonesia, which builds on the U.S.-supported Community Epidemic and  Pandemic Preparedness Program (CP3);   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Extending the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Stop

Transmission of Polio (STOP) program to the Indo-Pacific region, particularly  in Papua New Guinea;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Supporting the Global Field Epidemiology Roadmap and exploring ways to

strengthen the secretariat role of the Task Force for Global Health, further  building on a CHS-supported high-level workshop in Geneva in February 2019  that brought together key players for this task;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Strengthening public health emergency operations centers and conducting

simulation exercises in selected partner countries including Cambodia, Laos  and Myanmar;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Working with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)

to accelerate the development and distribution of vaccines against emerging  infectious diseases, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to improve access to new  and under-used vaccines for the most vulnerable children and cohorts in the  world’s poorest countries;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Australian Defence Force (ADF) and US Indo-Pacific Command co-

convening a series of webinars for counterpart agencies on Health Security in  the Pacific with a focus on Pacific Island countries, and culminating in an in-person Pacific Regional Health Security Workshop in 2021;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The ADF and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command co-convening Military Health

Security Summit 2021 in Sydney, Australia, building on the outcomes of the

successful Australia Defence Force-USINDOPACOM co-hosted Military Health  Security Summit in June 2019.

These activities will continue to expand Indo-Pacific health security engagement and  capacity building and build on the significant progress achieved under this bilateral  multi-sectoral partnership over the last two years. We welcome in particular the focus  on the Pacific where, in response to the vulnerabilities of Pacific Island countries,  Australia and the United States have successfully collaborated to:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Co-procure, along with other partners, nearly 100,000 GeneXpert cartridges

and testing machines to enable in-country COVID-19 testing;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Coordinate contributions to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) assisting

on the ground in countries in their COVID-19 response;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Coordinate ventilator and oxygen supply donations to match needs;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Provide complementary support for the establishment of air transport and

logistics services for the Pacific Humanitarian Pathway, which will assist the  Pacific Islands Forum with the delivery of humanitarian and critical medical  supplies, including personal protective equipment, within the region, and;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Coordinate support efforts through participation in regular U.S.-Affiliated

Pacific Islands teleconferences.

Australia and the United States have demonstrated their commitment to  transparency and accountability in global health security over the past twelve months  by:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Conducting regular interagency health security dialogues to share

information, policy perspectives, and best practice from our respective health  security investments, with the engagement of the U.S. Department of State,  the U.S. CDC, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Defense Threat  Reduction Agency (DTRA);  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Commencing staff exchanges, with Australia’s Indo-Pacific Centre for Health

Security (CHS) hosting a U.S. Government Science Fellow for three months in  2019 from DTRA;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Conducting consultations between CHS and U.S. government country teams

and other in-country experts to support DFAT’s 2018 Health Security Scoping  Missions in the Indo-Pacific;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Providing joint leadership within the Steering Group of the multilateral Global

Health Security Agenda (GHSA 2024; including through Australia’s  Secretariat role and rotating membership of the Steering Group from 1  January 2019 and the U.S. government’s permanent membership), supporting  the GHSA 2024 health security capacity improvement target and furthering  the objectives of the GHSA Action Packages for Antimicrobial Resistance,

Biosecurity and Biosafety, Sustainable Financing for Preparedness, and  Workforce Development;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Coordinating support for One Health capacity building through multilateral

partners to enhance understanding of emerging zoonotic disease and  antimicrobial resistance risk, and enable targeted risk-based mitigation along  animal value chains and in live animal markets in the Greater Mekong sub-region;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Aligning U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) Oceania and ADF Joint

Medical Command Strategies, including executing joint health workforce  development activities and collaborating on a regional health security forum  at the inaugural Global Health Security Conference in Sydney in June 2019;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Co-convening the first-ever Southeast Asia Health Security Donor

Coordination Meeting in September 2019, involving the Australian  government, the U.K. government, multilateral organisations and six U.S.  government agencies;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Developing an Indo-Pacific Collaborative Engagement Plan for DTRA’s

Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP) and CHS, which may extend to  other agencies in the future.

The United States and Australia look forward to continuing to work together  bilaterally, and regionally including in relevant regional organizations, and in  international forums, to promote an Indo-Pacific region that is safe and secure from  the threats posed by infectious diseases and to reduce the risks of future pandemics.  There has never been a more vital time to strengthen global health security.”
