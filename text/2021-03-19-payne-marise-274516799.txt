MEDIA RELEASE  AMBASSADOR TO AFGHANISTAN

Today I announce the appointment of Mr Paul Wojciechowski as Australia’s next  Ambassador to Afghanistan.

Australia and Afghanistan enjoy a strong friendship and respectful relationship based on  more than 50 years of diplomatic relations.

Australians in civil and military roles have served in Afghanistan for almost two decades,  working towards Afghanistan’s shared commitment to peace, prosperity and security.  Australia strongly supports the Afghanistan Peace Negotiations and a comprehensive  ceasefire as a vital first element of a just, resilient and durable peace arrangement.

Australia has provided $1.5 billion in development assistance to Afghanistan since  2001. For 2020-21, Australia has allocated $52.5 million in official development  assistance. This will support health security, economic recovery, stability and resilience,  and a continued focus on women and girls as outlined in the COVID-19 Response Plan.

Mr Wojciechowski is a senior career officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and  Trade and was most recently Assistant Secretary, COVID-19 Coordination Unit. He  previously served as the Australian Ambassador to Poland and earlier in our Embassies  in Brussels, Jakarta and Seoul. His career demonstrates a depth of experience  including in South Asia, trade and development matters.

Mr Wojciechowski holds a Master of Arts from Monash University; a Bachelor of  Economics and a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Queensland; and a Graduate  Diploma of Foreign Affairs and Trade from Australian National University.

I thank outgoing Ambassador Geoff Tooth for his contributions to advancing Australia’s interests  in Afghanistan since 2019.
