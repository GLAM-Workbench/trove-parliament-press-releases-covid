NATIONAL CABINET STATEMENT



The National Cabinet met today to discuss Australia’s COVID-19 response and the Australian  COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy.

National Cabinet continues to work together to address issues and find solutions to the health and  economic consequences of COVID-19.

The Chief Medical Officer, Professor Paul Kelly, provided an update on the latest epidemiological  data and medical advice in relation to COVID-19. There have been 29,390 confirmed cases in  Australia and, sadly, 909 people have died. More than 16 million tests have been undertaken in  Australia.

To date Australia’s existing systems built around social distancing, testing, tracing, local health  responses and quarantine have effectively mitigated the broader spread of COVID-19 virus and new  variants of COVID-19 into the Australian community. COVID-19 vaccines will further strengthen  Australia’s ability to control the virus.

Australia has done well on both the health and economic fronts compared to most countries around  the world. National Cabinet noted the significant increase in COVID-19 cases in many countries and  the comparative strength of Australia’s effort in addressing COVID compared to most other  developed economies.

Globally there have been over 133 million cases and sadly over 2.9 million deaths, with around  816,000 new cases reported in the last 24 hours.

Australia’s COVID-19 vaccine roll out is expanding. To date 1,077,511 doses of COVID-19 vaccines  have been administered in Australians, including 81,297 in the last 24 hours.

National Cabinet received a detailed update from Professor Brendan Murphy, Chair of the Science  and Industry Technical Advisory Group, and the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer, Professor  Paul Kelly on the Australian Vaccination and Treatment Strategy and the Australian Technical  Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) advice on the use of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.  National Cabinet agreed to continue the Australian Vaccination Strategy for 1A and 1B priority  populations. National Cabinet agreed that the new ATAGI advice will require a recalibration of the  Australian Vaccination Strategy for future phases, with changes worked through in consultation with  states, territories and medical experts over the coming weeks.



The Commonwealth Government has allocated over $7 billion to support the COVID-19 vaccine  strategy with contracts for over 170 million COVID-19 vaccine doses, through a diverse vaccine  portfolio including the AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Novavax and through the COVAX facility.

National Cabinet welcomed the announcement of a two-way quarantine free travel arrangements  with New Zealand. National Cabinet further reiterated support for the ongoing outbreaks in PNG and  Timor Leste.

National Cabinet will meet again on Friday 7 May 2021.

Respect@Work

National Cabinet considered the Sex Discrimination Commissioner’s Respect@Work report, along  with the Australian Government’s response, Roadmap for Respect: Preventing and Addressing Sexual  Harassment in Australian Workplaces. States and Territories have now agreed to provide a formal  response to the Respect@Work report including recommendations specifically relevant to their  jurisdiction by the end of June.

National Cabinet also considered the next phase of the $150 million COVID family and domestic  violence package. The Commonwealth provided $130 million of this funding to States and Territories  for frontline services to 30 June 2021. State and Territory Governments will now urgently provide  updated reports on their acquittal of this spending, as well as future spending on these priorities and  ongoing spending. This will assist the Commonwealth as it considers funding commitments and also  ensure the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments are all working together on this  important issue.

National Cabinet noted that Women’s Safety Ministers met this week and discussed the next  National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children, including a National Summit  scheduled for 29 and 30 July. In July, National Cabinet will discuss women’s economic security and  consider all of the Commonwealth, State and Territory initiatives, programs and spending. As part of  that discussion, National Cabinet will also consider establishing whether we embark on a National  Plan process for women’s economic security.

National Cabinet’s work on women’s safety and economic security recognises that all governments  have responsibility for these important issues.

Update on Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) Advice on AstraZeneca  COVID-19 Vaccines

National Cabinet noted the advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation  (ATAGI) on the use of the AstraZeneca COVID-19.

The ATAGI advice is clear that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective in preventing  severe disease caused by COVID-19.

The medical advice to the Government is that the risk of blood clotting side effects from the  AstraZeneca vaccine is around 5 in one million people, in the first four to 20 days post the vaccine.  This is a rare but serious side effect.

The ATAGI advice is that the Pfizer vaccine is preferred for adults under the age of 50. The  AstraZeneca vaccine should be given as a first dose to adults under the age of 50 where the benefit  clearly outweighs the risk for that individual.

AstraZeneca is recommended for those over the age of 50.

National Cabinet agreed that the new ATAGI advice will require a recalibration of the Australian  vaccination strategy, with changes worked through in consultation with states, territories and  medical experts over the coming weeks.

The vaccination program for 1A and 1B Priority populations will continue, particularly for the most  vulnerable Australians in Phase 1B including those over the age of 70 who are not impacted by this  revised advice. Changes will be made to allow Australians under 50 years of age in priority  populations 1A and 1B to receive the Pfizer vaccines reflecting the new ATAGI advice.

COVID-19 Data Releases

National Cabinet agreed to release daily and weekly COVID-19 vaccination data. Detailed daily data  will be released from today with weekly data released from next week.

Daily data will include a breakdown of doses delivered by the Commonwealth and by states and  territories, and also by administration source.

Weekly data will also include:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ State, territory and Commonwealth weekly breakdowns of vaccines distributed, available  and administered and dose utilisation  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ State and territory weekly breakdowns of doses administered, as well as to aged care and

disability residents and primary health care (GPs)

National Cabinet noted that the Commonwealth had previously provided states and territories with  a 12-week forward plan and dose distribution under the revised vaccination program. National  Cabinet agreed that the Commonwealth will now provide states and territories with a 10-week  forward vaccine dose supply schedule, updated every four weeks.

COVID-19 Risk Analysis and Response

National Cabinet received an update from the COVID-19 Risk Analysis and Response  - led by the  Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Phil Gaetjens and comprising his  State and Territory counterparts.

Based on this update, National Cabinet agreed to principles for reopening Australia, updated for the  current risk environment.

The first principles prioritise the vaccine rollout. The rollout should occur as quickly as possible and  take up be encouraged as a priority, with safety as a paramount objective. Progress on an effective  vaccine rollout will be key to maintaining the easing of domestic restrictions, easing and opening  international borders, and unlocking economic opportunities.

The second principle is to maintain readiness to ensure suppression. Even as the vaccine rollout  accelerates, we will continue to minimise community transmission through our key lines of defence:  high quality quarantine, contact tracing and testing.



These lines of defence are working well. Australia has received over 430,000 arrivals into quarantine  since March 2020. Of these, over 3,000 have tested positive for COVID-19, with only 14 transmission  events.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The remaining principles echo the principles adopted in November:   o Proportionate measures | Responses to new outbreaks are proportionate to the risk  of harm and transmission.

o Consistent approaches | Wherever possible, consistent approaches will be used,  linked to transparent risk assessment to retain public confidence, while maintaining  health protection and supporting economic recovery.

o Protect national wellbeing | While protecting the community, decisions should  minimise the impact on jobs, businesses, mental health and social isolation.

o Effective and coordinated communications | We will continue to strive to provide  clear and balanced communication of risks and responses to the pandemic.

o Maintain and support confidence | Maintaining community, business and consumer  confidence is key.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The National Cabinet also made several specific decisions to take us further down the path  of reopening Australia. Each of these decisions were based on AHPPC advice prepared for  the Taskforce.   o Density restrictions: easing venue restrictions to be no stricter than the 2 square

metre rule.

o Capacity restrictions: Large, ticketed and seated gatherings can have 100 percent  capacity.

o Outbreak responses: Jurisdictions will prioritise local containment measures and aim  for outbreak responses that keep internal borders open.

National Cabinet tasked First Secretaries to work with AHPPC to provide advice on the implications  for quarantine arrangements and reopening Australia following the successful vaccine rollout to the  most vulnerable Australians (phase 1A and 1B).

Data Sharing

National Cabinet agreed that jurisdictions will work together to capitalise on the value of public data  to achieve better outcomes for Australians. In order to achieve this, First Ministers committed to  develop an intergovernmental agreement which will be considered at a future National Cabinet  meeting.

International Passenger Arrival Caps

National Cabinet welcomed the recommencement of international passenger flights into Melbourne.  Victoria is initially receiving 800 international arrivals per week, increasing to 1000 arrivals per week  as soon as possible.

National Cabinet agreed that the existing arrangements on International Passenger Arrival Caps in  other jurisdictions would remain in place until 17 June with the exception of Queensland.

Until 11:59pm on 13 April the cap in Queensland is set to a maximum of 650 international arrivals  with a return to 1,000 arrivals combined with a surge capacity of 300 arrivals, as soon as possible.
