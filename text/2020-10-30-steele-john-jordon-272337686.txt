GREENS WELCOME DISABILITY ROYAL COMMISSION EXTENSION



Friday 30 October 2020

Australian Greens Disability Rights and Services spokesperson Senator Jordon

Steele-John has welcomed the Chair's request for an 18 month extension

to the Royal Commission into the Violence, Abuse, Exploitation and Neglect of

People with Disability  ahead of the release of the Commission's interim report.



"Disabled people and the community have been campaigning for this for a

really long time; it'r great to see that the Commission is listening," Steele-John

said.



"We've known for some time that our Royal Commission would need more time

to examine the violence, abuse, exploitation and neglect of disabled people; I

am glad the Chair has seen the writing on the wall and taken steps to ensure

that these important issues are given the time time they deserve



"Not only has COVID-19 caused significant delays to the important work of the

commission, it has also created new areas of investigation and these must be

examined in full.



"Furthermore, failure by the Morrison government to address privacy concerns

has - in the Chair's own words - impeded the work of the Commission so far.

This extension will give more people the opportunity to come forward and testify



once that privacy issued is resolved.



"The Commission is yet to hold public hearings in Tasmania, South Australia,

Western Australia, the ACT or the Northern Territory. and it has not yet had an

opportunity to engage properly with First Nations Australians, people from

culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds nor with people who live in

rural and regional Australia.



"These intersections are critical to gaining a full understanding of the

experiences of disabled people, and in ensuring that the final recommendations

of our Royal Commission deliver justice for the community and contribute to the

development of a more inclusive Australia for everyone."
