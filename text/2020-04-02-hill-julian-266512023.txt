LABOR REQUESTS AUDIT INTO GOVERNMENT’S COVID-19 ECONOMIC  RESPONSE MEASURES

Labor has written to the Australian Auditor-General to request that the Australian National  Audit Office (ANAO) instigate an audit program to scrutinise government spending in  relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the last three weeks alone, the Government has announced just over $200 billion in  direct financial support, designed to support workers and businesses during the COVID-19  outbreak.

Labor has consistently said that we will be constructive, responsible and supportive of the  economic responses the government has announced in response to the health and  economic crisis caused by COVID-19.

The priority of course must be to get help to those who need it quickly. However, it’s also  important to ensure that such eye-watering sums of taxpayer money are spent as  efficiently and effectively as possible.

Due to the unprecedented amount of taxpayer funds being spent over the next 12 months,  and with the extra ministerial powers to change government payments which could lead  overnight to billions more in spending without Parliamentary approval, Labor believes that  appropriate scrutiny by the ANAO is needed to ensure the highest levels of accountability  and good governance are met.

Such scrutiny is particularly crucial at a time when the Parliament is sitting less regularly  due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation.

A comprehensive audit program by the Auditor-General can improve public confidence,  transparency and help the Australian Public Service in efficiently and effectively delivering  stimulus and support.



Labor calls on the government back this request.
