4 Budget 2020-21   |   COVID-19 and the Australian Government’s Response

COVID-19 and  the Australian  Government’s response

Australians have experienced a year like no other.  The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound  impact on Australia’s health system, community,  and economy, as it has all around the world.

The Government acted quickly and decisively  to address the consequences of COVID-19. As  a result, Australia has achieved some of the  best health and economic outcomes in the  world. However, the impacts of COVID-19 will  continue to be felt in the Australian economy  for years to come. The Australian community  also continues to feel the effects of COVID-19,  through disruption to their lives, education  and health.  The global economic outlook  remains highly uncertain, with many countries  experiencing their worst downturns since the  Great Depression.

The Government has recognised that this once-in-a-century shock warrants an extraordinary  level of support across the economy.

The Government’s economic response was  designed to support Australian households and  businesses through an exceptionally difficult  period. It has helped keep businesses in business  and Australians in jobs through the JobKeeper

Payment and Boosting Cash Flow for Employers,  and supported Australians in need with the  Coronavirus Supplement and Early Release of  Superannuation.

The Government’s response is now transitioning  to ensure the Australian economy recovers  strongly by targeting additional temporary  support measures to boost household incomes,  bring forward business and infrastructure  investment activity, and drive the unemployment  rate back down.

The Government is continuing to support those  sectors, regions and communities that face  significant challenges.

8 Budget 2020-21   |   COVID-19 and the Australian Government’s Response

Protecting the health  of all Australians Preventing, detecting and treating  COVID-19

The Government is continuing to strengthen the  COVID-19 health response, committing additional  funding of $4.9 billion in this Budget to provide  critical health care and support to protect the  health of all Australians.

COVID-19 testing The Government is providing funding for  primary care, including over $750 million for  COVID-19 testing and $171 million for the  continued operation of up to 150 dedicated  respiratory clinics.

These measures will continue to ensure access  to testing for all Australians, including in regional  and remote communities. Australia’s testing  rate is among the highest in the world which has  helped us to contain the spread of the virus and  record relatively low known cases.

Supporting our hospitals The Government is continuing to support our  hospitals to respond to COVID-19 by providing  a further $1.1 billion to states and territories,

including funding to ensure private hospitals are  available to support the health response.

COVID-19 vaccines and  medical research The Government is committed to providing all  Australians access to safe and effective   COVID-19 vaccines and treatments as soon   as they are available.

The Government is providing $1.7 billion to  secure access to over 84.8 million doses of  potential vaccines being developed by the  University of Oxford and the University of  Queensland. The Government is also investing  $123 million to join the international COVAX  facility, securing access to a large portfolio of  potential vaccine candidates around the world.

The Government is investing in research and  development into COVID-19 vaccines and  treatments. Funding of almost $6 million from  the Medical Research Future Fund’s Coronavirus  Research Response, will support research and  development of COVID-19 vaccines at   Australian universities.

10 Budget 2020-21   |   COVID-19 and the Australian Government’s Response

Protecting the health of  all Australians Access to personal protective  equipment The Government has invested $3.2 billion in  personal protective equipment. Over 76 million  masks, and other protective equipment, has  been distributed from the National Medical  Stockpile to protect frontline workers. The  Government has invested in over 9,000 additional  ventilators to ensure capacity is available.

Delivering telehealth The Government is providing $112 million to  support the continuation of temporary Medicare  rebated telehealth services, ensuring access  to GP consultations, specialist appointments,  mental health and other allied health services.  To date, more than 30 million telehealth services  have been delivered to over 10 million patients.

Supporting access to  medicines The Government is ensuring vulnerable  Australians continue to receive free home  delivery of essential medicines by their local  pharmacy through the Home Medicines Service.  This service has delivered more than one million  medicines to patients’ homes at no additional  cost to patients.

Protecting senior Australians  The Government has provided $1.6 billion to  ensure the safety of senior Australians accessing  aged care since the start of the pandemic. The  Government is ensuring the aged care sector’s  preparedness during COVID-19 through the Aged  Care Emergency Response Plan.

This Budget includes $245 million for residential  aged care providers to assist with additional  costs, including infection control training and  outbreak preparedness. This builds on the   $205 million provided in June this year.

In recognition of the ongoing pressure and  challenges faced by workers delivering frontline  aged care services, the Government will provide  $205.1 million for the Workforce Retention   Bonus Payment.

The Government will provide $10.8 million to  improve pathways for new nurses to pursue a  career in aged care and enhance the skills of  existing nurses and care workers in aged care,  including through a new Skill Development  Program for aged care staff.

The Government is supporting the operation of  the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre, with  $9.1 million in this Budget.

Supporting Australians’  wellbeing during the  pandemic Ensuring the provision of essential  mental health and disability services  through the COVID-19 pandemic

Access to mental health  services In this Budget, more than $148 million in  additional funding is being provided for  mental health supports to help individuals and  communities through the pandemic.

All Australians will now be able to access  10 additional Medicare rebated psychology  sessions, with the support of their GP. This  will increase access to mental health care for  Australians who are experiencing more severe or  enduring mental health impacts as a result of the  COVID-19 pandemic, at a cost of $101 million.

The Government has provided $48.1 million to  support the implementation of the National  Mental Health and Wellbeing Pandemic  Response Plan, to ensure individuals are  connected to the care they need.

Critical frontline services, including headspace,  Lifeline, Kids Helpline and Beyond Blue have  been provided with more than $14 million in  additional funding in this Budget to ensure they  can continue to provide digital and telephone  support to individuals, particularly in Victoria.

More young Australians with a mental illness will  be supported to participate in the workplace with  $45.7 million to expand the headspace individual  placement and support program.

Supporting those with  disability through the  pandemic During the pandemic, the Government is  ensuring essential supports are in place for  NDIS participants and workers. The Government  has delivered financial assistance to disability  providers to support the retention of workers.

Delivering support   for families Ensuring our child care sector  remains strong and viable to support  Australia’s economic recovery

Supporting the child care  sector The Government has implemented measures  to help the early childhood education and care  sector and families manage the impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic.

During the early stages of the pandemic, families  received free child care through the Early  Childhood Education and Care Relief Package.  The package provided $1.9 billion to support the  viability of the sector including weekly Business  Continuity Payments to child care providers  worth 50 per cent of the sector’s fee revenue  pre-COVID. The Relief Package meant that   99 per cent of Australia’s 13,400 child care  services remained operational and were able to

provide care to vulnerable and disadvantaged  children and the children of essential workers.

On 13 July 2020, the Government re-established  the Child Care Subsidy arrangements to ensure  sufficient childcare places were available to  all families. To support child care services, the  Government provided $708 million in Transition  Payments, equal to 25 per cent of the service’s  pre-COVID revenue until 27 September 2020.

The Government introduced an Employment  Guarantee to support the early childhood  workforce through the pandemic and a freeze  on fee increases where services are in receipt of  Transition Payments.

COVID-19 and the Australian Government’s Response   |   Budget 2020-21  15

In light of the second wave lockdown, the  Government introduced a further $372 million  Child Care Recovery Package for Victoria.  Victorian services receive a 25 per cent Recovery  Payment through to 31 January 2021, on the  condition that they maintain a fee freeze at  pre-COVID levels, and continue the Employment  Guarantee to ensure services retain their staff.

The Government is also extending the easing of  the Activity Test requirements for all Australian  families to 4 April 2021 so they can continue  to receive the same level of subsidised care as  before the pandemic.

Early access to super The Government is allowing  individuals access to their super early  in times of hardship

To complement other support measures, such  as the JobKeeper Payment and the Coronavirus  Supplement, the Government has allowed  eligible individuals to gain early access to a  portion of their superannuation.

This measure recognises that for those  suffering adverse financial effects from the  COVID-19 pandemic, accessing some of their  superannuation today may outweigh the  benefits of maintaining those savings   until retirement.

Eligible Australian and New Zealand citizens  and permanent residents were able to apply for  early access up to a maximum of $10,000 of their  superannuation before 1 July 2020. They are also  able to access a further $10,000 until   31 December 2020.

Eligible temporary visa holders were also able to  apply for a single release of up to $10,000 before  1 July 2020.

Close to 3 million individuals have so far  accessed their superannuation early under this  measure, withdrawing over $35 billion to support  themselves through the pandemic.

The measure has delivered support to people  in a timely manner with 95 per cent of all

applications being processed and paid out by  superannuation funds within five business days.

For many people in acute financial distress, the  amounts released have provided a critical means  of support to help them meet their expenses at a  time when they need it most.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)  Household Impacts of COVID-19 Survey showed  that 57 per cent of those who had accessed their  superannuation had used or planned to use it to  pay household bills, mortgages, rent and other  debts. A further 36 per cent planned to save it.

Reduction in social security  deeming rates The Government has provided additional  payments of around $876 million to income  support recipients by reducing social security  deeming rates. From 1 May 2020, the lower  deeming rate has been 0.25 per cent and the  upper deeming rate has been 2.25 per cent.

This measure assists around 900,000 income  support recipients, including around 565,000  pensioners, who benefit from an increase in their  payment rate.

Temporary reduction in  superannuation minimum  drawdown requirements The Government has reduced the  superannuation minimum drawdown rates for  account-based pensions and similar products by  50 per cent for the 2019-20 and 2020-21 financial  years. This measure helps retirees manage the  impact of volatility in financial markets on their  retirement savings.

Providing income  support Supporting Australians through the  COVID-19 pandemic

Targeted and demand driven income assistance  programs will continue to ensure that support  remains appropriate to the economic and health  conditions. Temporary additional payments to  those most in need are supporting the economy  during these tough times.

Economic Support Payments  The Government provided $9.4 billion in support  through two Economic Support Payments of  $750 to eligible social security, veterans, income

support recipients and concession card   holders. Around half of those who benefited  were pensioners.

The first payment, from 31 March 2020, went to  over 7 million Australians to help them manage  the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The second payment from 13 July 2020 has  benefited around 5 million Australians.

Additional income support for  individuals The Government is providing $16.8 billion to  support new and existing income support  recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic,   with the temporary Coronavirus Supplement   and expanded eligibility for income   support payments.

The Coronavirus Supplement has been extended  until 31 December 2020 at a rate of $250 per  fortnight from 25 September 2020.

The Coronavirus Supplement is currently  benefiting around 2.2 million Australians who  receive an eligible income support payment,  such as the JobSeeker Payment, Youth Allowance  and Parenting Payment.

To date, the Government has provided   over $14 b illion in Coronavirus   Supplement payments.

Supporting pensioners The Government will provide $2.6 billion for   two additional Economic Support Payments of  $250 to pensioners and other eligible recipients.

These payments will assist them through the  financial challenges they continue to face as a  result of COVID-19 and benefit around 5.1 million  eligible pensioners and veterans, and low income  families and eligible concession card holders   who are not in receipt of a primary income  support payment.

These payments are additional to the $9.4 billion  in support provided through the two previous  Economic Support Payments of $750 to social  security and other eligible recipients.

Pandemic Leave Disaster  Payment The Government is partnering with states and  territories to deliver the $34.3 million Pandemic  Leave Disaster Payment to help stop the spread  of COVID-19.

The Payment is a one-off grant of $1,500 to  eligible workers who are unable to work and earn  income while under a direction to self-isolate or  quarantine or who are caring for someone who  has tested positive for COVID-19.

To date, the Government has made around  10,000 payments to residents of Victoria, New  South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia.

HomeBuilder Supporting residential construction jobs

The Government recognises the residential  construction sector’s important role in the  Australian economy - industry sources estimate  that the residential construction sector provides  work to around one million people including  builders, contractors, property developers,  construction materials manufacturers,  engineers, designers and architects.

The Government introduced HomeBuilder in  June 2020 to help the residential construction  sector recover from the effects of the COVID-19  pandemic. HomeBuilder is playing a key role in  building confidence in the sector and supporting  tradies’ jobs.

HomeBuilder is designed to encourage those  who may have understandably pulled back from  undertaking a new build or rebuild when the  COVID-19 pandemic hit, to enter the market and  keep the construction pipeline flowing.

HomeBuilder provides eligible owner-occupiers  (including first home buyers) with a tax-free  grant of $25,000 to build a new home or rebuild  an existing home.

HomeBuilder complements existing state and  territory first home owner grant programs,  stamp duty concessions and other grant  schemes, as well as the Commonwealth’s First  Home Loan Deposit Scheme and First Home  Super Saver Scheme.

By giving Australians confidence and support  to enter the new home market, or make  it more affordable to add to their existing  home, HomeBuilder is protecting jobs across  the construction industry at a time when the  economy needs it most.

JobKeeper Payment Keeping businesses in business   and Australians in jobs

The Government’s JobKeeper Payment has  been an essential lifeline in helping businesses  impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic retain their  employees and in assisting sole traders.

The JobKeeper Payment is one of the largest  fiscal and labour market interventions in  Australia’s history. The JobKeeper Payment  is currently supporting around 3.5 million  individuals, in over 900,000 businesses. To date,  payments have totalled around $60 billion. The  JobKeeper Payment has been well targeted to  businesses that have experienced a significant  decline in turnover and has helped those  businesses to recover where restrictions have  eased.

The Government announced on 21 July 2020 an  extension of the JobKeeper Payment for a further  six months until 28 March 2021, with the Payment  tapered and targeted to those businesses that  continue to be most significantly affected by the  economic downturn.

A two-tiered payment has also been introduced  to better align the payment with the hours  worked by employees and business owners  before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Higher  Payment

Lower  Payment

28 September 2020  to 3 January 2021 $1,200 $750

4 January 2021   to 28 March 2021

$1,000 $650

While the Government’s JobKeeper Payment  has so far provided unprecedented support to  Australian businesses and their employees, the  impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are still being  felt by many.

Further changes made to the JobKeeper  Payment, announced on 7 August 2020, make  it easier for those affected by COVID-19 related  shut-downs to receive the support they need.  Employees that were employed before   1 July 2020 can now be eligible and the turnover  test has been changed, improving accessibility   for businesses.

These changes, combined with the effect of the  restrictions imposed in Victoria, bring the overall  program cost to an estimated $101.3 billion over  2019-20 and 2020-21.

Supporting Apprentices  and Trainees Maintaining Australia’s skills pipeline

As part of its COVID-19 Economic Response,  the Government invested $2.8 billion in the  Supporting Apprentices and Trainees wage  subsidy to support business to keep their  apprentices and trainees employed.

Apprenticeships and traineeships are a critical  part of Australia’s skills pipeline and are a key  pathway into the workforce, particularly for  young Australians. The Supporting Apprentices  and Trainees wage subsidy ensures apprentices  and trainees already in work remain engaged  and are in a position to support the   economic recovery.

The Government extended and expanded the  Supporting Apprentices and Trainees wage  subsidy as part of the July 2020 Economic and  Fiscal Update.

The subsidy is available to support small and  medium-sized businesses with fewer than

200 employees, including those using a Group  Training Organisation, who retain an Australian  Apprentice engaged as at 1 July 2020.

Eligible employers can apply for a wage subsidy  of 50 per cent of an apprentice’s or trainee’s  wage paid from 1 July 2020 to 31 March 2021, up  to a cap of $7,000 per quarter. Employers of any  size, including Group Training Organisations, that  re-engage an eligible out-of-trade apprentice or  trainee will also be eligible for the subsidy.

This measure will support approximately 90,000  small and medium-sized businesses, employing  around 180,000 apprentices.

The Government is investing further into  Australia’s training system and skills pipeline,  committing an additional $1.2 billion through  the Boosting Apprenticeships Wage Subsidy to  increase the number of new apprenticeships   and traineeships.

Boosting Cash Flow   for Employers Helping businesses stay open and  keep people in jobs

The Government is delivering cash flow boost  payments to small and medium sized businesses  and not-for-profit entities to support them to  keep operating, pay their rent, electricity and  other bills, and retain staff during the   COVID-19 pandemic.

To date, around 800,000 employers across  Australia have been credited with more than   $28 billion in cash flow support. This has helped  keep small businesses open and meant staff  have retained their jobs.

The cash flow boost payments are tax-free and  are automatically delivered to eligible entities  by the Australian Taxation Office. This ensures  entities receive the cash flow support quickly and  efficiently without any new or additional forms.  This allows employers to focus on their business  and staff.

Eligible entities receive a minimum of $20,000  and up to $100,000 for the March to   September 2020 period. Support has been  flowing since April 2020.

This temporary cash flow support helps  businesses and not-for-profit entities to be in  the best possible position to weather the crisis,  recover strongly and continue to grow.

The Government is backing businesses to invest  to help the economy withstand and recover from  the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As part of its economic response to COVID-19,  the Government enhanced the instant asset  write-off and introduced a 15 month Backing  Business Investment incentive to support  business investment over the short-term. Around  3.5 million businesses are eligible to access   these measures.

From 12 March 2020, the instant asset write-off  threshold was increased to $150,000 (up from  $30,000) and access was expanded to include  businesses with a turnover of less than   $500 million (up from $50 million).

The threshold applies on a per asset basis,  so eligible businesses can instantly write-off  multiple assets each costing less than $150,000  that are purchased by 31 December 2020. As part  of the 2020-21 Budget, businesses will have an  extra six months to first use or install   these assets.

The Backing Business Investment incentive  complements the enhanced instant asset   write-off by allowing businesses with a turnover  of less than $500 million to deduct 50 per cent of  the cost of an eligible asset installed by   30 June 2021. Existing depreciation rules apply   to the balance of the asset’s cost.

The Government is building on the enhanced  instant asset write-off and Backing Business  Investment incentive in the 2020-21 Budget by  introducing temporary full expensing to support  investment and jobs. Full expensing applies from  announcement on Budget night until   30 June 2022.

Temporary insolvency  measures On 22 March 2020, the Government announced  temporary relief for financially distressed  companies, to provide the opportunity for as  many businesses as possible to survive. On   7 September 2020, the Government announced   a further extension of this relief to   31 December 2020. The relief includes changes to  insolvency laws to provide:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A temporary increase in the threshold at  which creditors can issue a statutory demand

on a company from $2,000 to $20,000, and  a temporary increase in the time companies  have to respond to statutory demands they  receive from 21 days to 6 months.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Temporary relief for directors from any  personal liability for trading while insolvent,  with respect to any debts incurred in the  ordinary course of the company’s business.

As part of the JobMaker Plan the Government  has announced that it is implementing  permanent insolvency reforms to help small  businesses survive the economic impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic.

Responsible lending  obligations  In April 2020, the Government also implemented  a temporary exemption from responsible lending  obligations for small business loans.   These changes made it easier for lenders to  provide credit to business owners looking to stay  open and keep their staff employed.

While responsible lending obligations are  not supposed to apply to business lending,  ambiguity in the law meant that these  obligations had impacted small business lending.

The Government has expanded and extended  the exemption for a further 6 months until   2 April 2021.

As part of the JobMaker Plan, the Government  has also announced a suite of permanent  changes to Australia’s lending laws to support  the flow of credit to the economy.

Reducing regulatory barriers The Government was able to flexibly respond   to issues affecting the ability of business   to comply with provisions of the   Corporations Act 2001, by introducing a   temporary instrument-making power.

The power has been used to:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ ensure that companies can conduct virtual  annual general meetings and sign documents  electronically until March 2021, with  permanent reforms to be made as part of the  Digital Business Plan; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ amend continuous disclosure provisions to  enable companies and their officers to more  confidently provide guidance to the market  during the COVID-19 pandemic until   March 2021.

The Government has established a $1 billion  Relief and Recovery Fund to provide tailored  support to a range of industries, regions, and  communities that have been most affected by  the COVID-19 pandemic. Initiatives announced  under the fund are supporting industries  including aviation, tourism, primary production  and the arts, with a focus on support to   regional areas.

The aviation sector has been critically  disrupted as a result of border closures and a  significant reduction in patronage and service  requirements. The COVID-19 pandemic has also  led to major air freight shortages and disrupted  supply chains around the world.

With international travel restrictions expected to  remain in place for the foreseeable future, our  exporters and key importers will continue to face  significant barriers. Primary industry exporters  have been affected by a loss of export markets  and difficulties accessing airfreight.

Because of their reliance on in-person  experiences, Australia’s arts and tourism sectors  have been particularly impacted by travel  restrictions and social distancing requirements.

Recognising these challenges, the Government  has provided additional support for these sectors  through the Relief and Recovery Fund.

The Government’s response to COVID-19  has ensured that credit continues to flow to  Australian households and businesses despite  the impacts of the pandemic. This response has  supported lending to small and medium sized  businesses in particular, assisting them to get  through to the other side.

The Government’s Coronavirus Small and  Medium Enterprises (SME) Guarantee Scheme  is supporting up to $40 billion of lending by  guaranteeing 50 per cent of eligible new loans  issued by participating lenders to SMEs.

Phase 1 of the Scheme provided businesses with  access to unsecured working capital loans to  help manage disrupted cash flows.

The Government has now extended and  enhanced the Scheme to support businesses in  recovery and those facing the ongoing impacts  of the COVID-19 pandemic. Phase 2 of the  Scheme will be available until 30 June 2021.

The Reserve Bank of Australia’s Term Funding  Facility is providing up to $200 billion in   low-cost funding to the banking system to  support the flow of credit and lower interest  rates for households and businesses. It provides  incentives for banks to increase lending to  businesses, with incentives greatest for lending  to small and medium-sized businesses.

The Government’s $15 billion Structured Finance  Support Fund is making targeted investments  through the securitisation market to support  funding for smaller lenders. This is helping to  promote the flow of credit and mitigate impacts  on competition in consumer and business  lending markets.

The Government and a number of banks are  also establishing the Australian Business Growth  Fund. The Fund will provide patient equity capital  to small and medium-sized businesses in a wide  range of industries across Australia.  This will  support their growth over time and also assist as  they move into the recovery phase of the   COVID-19 pandemic.
