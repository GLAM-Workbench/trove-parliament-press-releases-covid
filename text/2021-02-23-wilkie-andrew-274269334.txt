NO REAL RELIEF FOR THOSE LIVING ON STRUGGLE STREET



Independent Member for Clark, Andrew Wilkie, says the Scrooge-like increase to the JobSeeker  payment will do next to nothing to ease the pain for Australians living on struggle street.

“Returning JobSeeker to the pre-pandemic level of $40 a day would have been devastating,” Mr  Wilkie said.  “But the $50-per-fortnight increase only equates to an extra $3.57 per day - not  even the price of a coffee or a salad roll. It’s a Scrooge-like move and simply not enough.

“In the Clark electorate alone, there are about 9,500 people on JobSeeker and the end of the $150  COVID supplement will strip about $1.4m from the local economy each fortnight.

“Just last week I shared the stories of 58 single mothers with Federal Parliament in the hope MPs  would learn something from them, change policy and finally end this poverty by design. These  women collectively spoke of how the JobSeeker COVID-19 supplement had greatly improved  their lives.

“Australia is a rich and fortunate country and there is simply no excuse that people struggling to  secure work cannot afford to cover basic needs like rent, running a car and putting enough food  on the table.

“We can afford to pay every eligible Australian a base rate to cover their reasonable expenses  and allow them a dignified life, not one where people are forced to choose between having  enough to eat or paying their rent.”
