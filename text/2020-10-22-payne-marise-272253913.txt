MEDIA RELEASE

Ambassador to Germany

Today I announce the appointment of Mr Philip Green OAM as Australia’s new Ambassador to  Germany. Mr Green will also be accredited to Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

Germany is a close and important partner for Australia with a common strategic outlook, shared  values and commitment to the rules-based international order, including in the Indo-Pacific. We  are working together to support multilateralism, human rights, trade liberalisation, shared  defence and security objectives and the international response to COVID-19. Germany is  Australia’s eleventh largest trading partner and fifth largest destination for foreign investment.  We appreciate Germany’s ongoing support for a comprehensive and ambitious free trade  agreement between Australia and the European Union.

Australia’s strong relationship with Switzerland is underpinned by shared economic interests.  Australia values our bilateral research cooperation and engagement on global challenges with  Switzerland.

Australia and Liechtenstein’s warm relationship reflects our common commitment to promoting  democracy, good governance and human rights around the world.

Mr Green is a senior career officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and was  most recently First Assistant Secretary, United States and Indo-Pacific Strategy Division. He  has previously served overseas as Head of Mission in Singapore, South Africa and Kenya.

Mr Green holds a Bachelor of Laws and a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Sydney.

I thank former Ambassador Lynette Wood for her contribution to advancing Australia’s interests  in Germany since 2016.
