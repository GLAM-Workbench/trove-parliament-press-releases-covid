MORRISON GOVERNMENT WASHES ITS HANDS OF PLANE CREW COVID

SAFETY



The Morrison Government is continuing to try to avoid any responsibility for keeping  Australia’s borders COVID-safe, this time washing its hands of COVID safety for  international pilots and crew.

On ABC Radio National today, the Deputy Prime Minister confirmed there were over  3000 international pilots and cabin crew in Australia. But under the Morrison  Government they have been able to avoid compulsory hotel quarantine, instead being  trusted to isolate at a hotel chosen by their airline.

Borders and aviation are Commonwealth Government responsibilities, no matter how  much the Morrison Government may wish they weren’t.

With 34 foreign airlines operating into Australia every week, the Morrison Government  needs to urgently address this weak link in Australia’s quarantine system.

While Federal Labor welcomes individual states taking action to strengthen their  containment measures, it is essential that the Morrison Government puts in place  consistent, national guidelines for pilot and crew quarantine and safety.

It is not good enough for the Morrison Government to once again wash its hands of  COVID safety, abrogating its responsibilities and leaving the job of keeping Australians  safe to the states alone .

All year Scott Morrison has passed the buck on quarantine to the states, just like he did  with the Ruby Princess and Aged Care.

Our international borders are too important for Scott Morrison to ignore.

It’s time Australia had a national border control quarantine plan.
