MINISTERIAL FORUM ON MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS

23 March 2021

Multicultural Affairs Ministers across Australia met on Friday 19 March 2021 to discuss issues of  national significance and to reflect on the values that bring us together as a nation.

The Hon Alex Hawke MP, Federal Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and  Multicultural Affairs chaired the Forum, which was attended by Ministers or their  representatives, from each State and Territory.

The Forum took place during Harmony Week, signalling the importance of inter-governmental  cooperation to maintain Australia’s social cohesion.

The Australian Human Rights Commission’s Race Discrimination Commissioner Chin Tan  briefed the Forum on his proposal for a National Anti-Racism Framework.

Ministers agreed to:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ deepen cooperation in relation to the safe, effective and culturally appropriate delivery of  COVID-19 vaccines to culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities, particularly  through the provision of effective information campaigns, both in English and community  languages;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ strengthen cooperation across jurisdictions and working in partnership with multicultural peak  bodies, community and faith leaders, to counter pandemic misinformation and to distribute  accurate, authorised and targeted health information to CALD communities, in English and in  community languages, including in accessible audio and visual formats;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ engage in regular dialogue between governments in order to strengthen Australia’s social  cohesion;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ strengthen government engagement with all communities to improve social cohesion and  tackle racism and discrimination;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ examine models for a National Anti-Racism Framework and areas for inter-governmental  cooperation and collaboration;
