JOINT MEDIA RELEASE  08 October 2020

BUDGET INVESTS MORE THAN $4 BILLION INTO NORTHERN AUSTRALIA

The Coalition Government is investing more than $4 billion in northern Australia to create  jobs and stimulate economic opportunities as the economy recovers from the COVID-19  pandemic.

Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia Keith Pitt said the Morrison-McCormack Government is implementing its plan to rebuild the economy and create jobs.

“We are getting on with economic recovery by investing over $4.15 billion to develop more  infrastructure and create jobs across Australia’s north,” Minister Pitt said.

“This is on top of a suite of nation-wide initiatives that will also benefit northern Australia.

“We will capitalise on the north’s advantages in gas, critical minerals and renewable energy  sources.”

Northern Australia is at the forefront of the gas-led recovery with $52.9 million invested for  Strategic Basin Plans for the Beetaloo and North Bowen and Galilee; independent scientific  research into the social, economic and environmental impacts of gas; and support for  emissions reduction through carbon capture.

“Gas will play a critical role in the nation’s economic recovery, to capture new opportunities  in global resources markets and position Australia to bounce back stronger,” Minister Pitt  said.

The $5 billion Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility received an additional $41.5 million  to extend operations for five years to 2026 and implement reforms to expand eligibility,  increase access to the facility, fast-track approvals, and accelerate lending.

Assistant Minister for Northern Australia Michelle Landry said the 2020-21 budget would  help northern Australia recover from the impact of COVID-19.

“The north is full of hard working, resilient, resourceful and compassionate people and  communities,” Assistant Minister Landry said.
