LINDA SCOTT ELECTED PRESIDENT OF AUSTRALIAN LOCAL  GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION

Labor congratulates Linda Scott on her election as President of the Australian  Local Government Association.

Linda brings with her a wealth of experience. She has served as Vice President  of the Australian Local Government Association since 2018, been a Councillor  on the City of Sydney since 2012 and served as Deputy Lord Mayor of the City  of Sydney between 2018 and 2019.

We also thank outgoing President David Oâ€™Loughlin who has served in this role  since 2016. David has advocated relentlessly for local government during his  four years as President, particularly throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

Local government across Australia have faced increasing challenges this year  from the horror bushfire season and record-breaking drought, to the COVID-19  pandemic.

Our councils know what their communities need - what will create local jobs  and what will help get local economies back on their feet - and the work they do  will also be essential in helping Australia emerge from this recession.

Linda Scott will be a strong advocate for local government in her new role as  President and we look forward to working with her.
