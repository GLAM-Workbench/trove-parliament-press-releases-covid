Funding to help Australian venues bring back the music

Applications are now open for the first round of the Morrison Government’s $20 million Live Music  Australia program, designed to bring more home-grown music to Australians stages.

Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher MP, said the first year  of the new live music program has been adapted to assist in recovery from COVID-19.

“This program will help the live music scene to adapt in this changing environment by supporting  venues to host gigs, performances and tours of local talent as restrictions ease,” Minister Fletcher said.

“I encourage pubs, clubs and venues around the country to apply for funding through the new Live  Music Australia program so they can get back on their feet and be ready to open their doors to once  again bring live home-grown music to Australian audiences.

“There will be a particular focus on small to medium-sized venues, which provide professional staging  for quality original Australian live music both to support emerging talent and provide established  musicians a setting to reconnect with their fans.”

Live Music Australia is an open competitive grant program which will deliver $5 million annually  over four years, with each of the two rounds per year providing $2.5 million. The aim of the 2020-21  funding is to:   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ assist venues as they prepare to reopen and rebuild their music programs as restrictions are

lifted on public gatherings and live performance  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ support performance opportunities for original contemporary music by Australia artists  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ support partnerships, collaboration and networks across the Australian live music industry.

“Along with many Australians, I can’t wait to see our musos back on stage doing their thing. This  country has long had a vibrant live music scene and we want it back as soon as public health  requirements allow!”

Live music performances contribute an estimated $15.4 billion to the Australian economy and create  65,000 full and part-time jobs. In 2018 contemporary music generated the highest ticket revenue in the  live performance sector, generating $1.092 billion, and attracted the highest attendance of 10.08  million.

The program is part of the Government’s $30.9 million Australian Music Industry Package, announced  in March 2019.
