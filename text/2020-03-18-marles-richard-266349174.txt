ANZAC DAY

Labor acknowledges the difficult decision to cancel Australian-led Anzac Day services  overseas and the tough decisions by a number of RSLs around Australia to cancel their  services.

This is a health crisis first and foremost and the health and safety, particularly of our older  veterans who are more vulnerable to COVID-19, is paramount.

In the case of overseas services, we need also to respect the views of host nations in  relation to the Coronavirus pandemic.

These are tough decisions to make and there are now arrangements in place, which will  prohibit public gatherings which limit the ability for Australians to gather together to honour  the service and sacrifice of our fallen.

It is understood that there will still be a televised event from the Australian War Memorial  and we encourage all Australians to make an effort on Anzac Day to remember those men  and women who have served our country and those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice.

Anzac Day is a part of the nation’s fabric. For many, there is no greater day on which we  honour and reflect on the service of our current and former service personnel.
