PANEL ESTABLISHED TO CREATE PATHWAYS TO GET   YOUNG AUSTRALIANS INTO JOBS

Twelve industry groups will help co-design new pathways for young people to find  employment, as part of a $10 million trial run by the Morrison Government.

A panel of national associations has been chosen to deliver the PaTH Business Placements  Partnerships Trial, which will come up with new ways for young people to get into work.

The trial will support the design and delivery of tailored pre-employment pathways, using  elements of the Government’s Youth Jobs PaTH program, as well as employment services  and other support.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash said it forms part of the Morrison Government’s COVID-19 Economic Recovery Plan  for Australia.

“The Morrison Government is committed to helping businesses come up with tailored pre-employment pathways that meet the needs of both employers and job seekers,” Minister Cash  said.

“These panel members will be able to work with hundreds of thousands of businesses around  the country to identify exactly what they want from a new recruit, and my department will  work with them to make sure young people are well supported into their jobs.

“This is an opportunity for the Government and industry to work together to deliver the best  possible employment pathways for young people and ensure they’re prepared for the  workplace, now and into the future.

“The panel represents a wide range of industries and has been chosen as part of the two-year  trial for their industry expertise and relationships.”

The 12 panel members are:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Accommodation Association of Australia Inc   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australian Meat Industry Council   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Housing Industry Association Ltd   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Motor Trades Association of Australia Ltd   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ National Disability Services Ltd   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ National Electrical Contractors Association
