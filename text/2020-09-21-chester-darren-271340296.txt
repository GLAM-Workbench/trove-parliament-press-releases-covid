NEW OPEN ARMS OFFICE IN MELBOURNE

VETERANS and their families in Melbourne will have easier access to Open Arms - Veterans &  Families Counselling (Open Arms) with the office relocating to 303 Collins Street.

Minister for Veterans’ Affairs Darren Chester said despite the current coronavirus restrictions in  Melbourne, work had continued on outfitting the new office space so veterans and their families  would have improved access to support when face-to-face counselling resumes.

“Open Arms’ Melbourne office has seen a 25 per cent increase in clients in the last 12 months, and  this increase is expected to continue throughout the pandemic,” Mr Chester said.

“With this in mind, the new location at 303 Collins Street, Melbourne is conveniently close to  Flinders Street Station, tram and bus routes and offers veterans and their families a modern, well  equipped and family friendly site with additional counselling rooms and large open office spaces to  ensure they are well-looked after.

“It is incredibly important that this relocation to improved office space is completed so our Victorian  veterans and their families can access the right facilities and services when they need to.”

Open Arms is Australia’s leading provider of high quality mental health assessment and clinical  counselling services for Australian veterans and their families.

“If you are a veteran or family member who may be struggling or in need of additional support, I  encourage you to call Open Arms 24/7 on 1800 011 046 or visit OpenArms.gov.au to find more  about services available.”

Open Arms was founded by our Vietnam veterans and is their enduring legacy of ensuring all  veterans and their families can access free and confidential mental health support.

The Melbourne Open Arms office is one of five in Victoria. For further information on Open Arms  locations, visit OpenArms.gov.au.
