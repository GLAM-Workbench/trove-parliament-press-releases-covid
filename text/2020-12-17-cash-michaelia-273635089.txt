Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said the Government remains acutely aware that the economic and labour market  fallout from COVID-19 will continue for some time to come.

“That is why the Morrison Government has committed an unprecedented $507 billion in  economic support, to help rebuild the economy and put Australia back on the road to  recovery,” Minister Cash said.

“This includes $257 billion in direct economic support including more than $101 billion in  JobKeeper payments to help cushion the impact of COVID-19 which has led to the most  severe global economic crisis since the Great Depression.

“This is the single largest economic support measure that any Australian Government has  introduced, which will help mitigate the difficulties that businesses and employees are  encountering as a result of COVID-19.”

The Morrison Government’s Economic Recovery Plan, described as key to saving jobs by the  OECD, will also continue to help boost Australia’s economic recovery, create further  employment opportunities and help to secure this country’s economic future.
