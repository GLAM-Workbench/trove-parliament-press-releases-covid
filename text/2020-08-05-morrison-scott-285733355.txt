MEDIA STATEMENT  05 Aug 2020  Prime Minister



Papua New Guinea and Australia are sovereign partners who share unique and  enduring connections that span decades. Ours is a special relationship underpinned by  a shared history, geographic proximity, common strategic interests, deep community  links, mutual respect, and cooperation across all spheres.

This Comprehensive Strategic and Economic Partnership (CSEP) reinforces the  strong bonds between our two countries and strengthens our ambitious vision for the  future. Through it, we commit to elevate our relationship, accelerate our strategic and  economic cooperation, and build on the close connections between our people,  institutions and communities. We enter into this Partnership at a time when the mutual  value of our friendship has been clearly demonstrated through our response to natural  disasters and a global pandemic, and the impacts these have had on our economies.

The CSEP provides an enduring and overarching framework for deepening bilateral  cooperation across security, trade and investment, governance, development  cooperation, health, education, gender equality, climate change, people-to-people and  institutional links, underpinned by a commitment to achieving concrete outcomes by  2030. Our progress in these areas will be reviewed periodically, with a comprehensive  review in 2030. Our partnership will build on strong foundations: the 1987 Joint  Declaration of Principles Guiding Relations between Australia and Papua New Guinea  (amended 1992), and the 2013 Joint Declaration for a New Papua New Guinea-Australia  Partnership. It will be guided by the following principles:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Respect for the laws, regulations and established processes of our individual  sovereign States  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Open communication to ensure we understand our respective points of view  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Shared responsibility to achieve joint strategic, economic, security, and social goals  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Support to assist each other in times of need  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Commitment to inclusive, sustainable and effective delivery of policies and

programs, including as informed by research and development priorities  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Flexibility to respond to emerging priorities, including capacity building, as they  arise.

Together we commit to advancing shared bilateral, regional and global objectives under  the following six pillars:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Pillar 1 - Strong Democracies for a Stable Future  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Pillar 2 - Close Friends, Enduring Ties  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Pillar 3 - Economic Partnership for Prosperity  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Pillar 4 - Strategic Cooperation for Security and Stability

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Pillar 5 - Social and Human Development  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Pillar 6 - Near Neighbours, Global Partners

We acknowledge our shared interests in a secure, stable, peaceful, prosperous and  democratic region; one in which safeguarding the sovereignty of each state is of critical  importance. Through this Partnership, the elements outlined under its six pillars, and  an Action Plan, we give practical effect to our ambitious vision for the benefit of our  people and for future generations.

Pillar 1 - Strong Democracies for a Stable  Future

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Papua New Guinea and Australia share strong traditions of participatory democracy  reflecting broader shared values. We recognise and respect our sovereignty, and the  fact that our democratic institutions, which are free from coercion and interference,  form the foundations of our security and stability.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We reaffirm our commitment to the rule of law and support Papua New Guinea in its  efforts to address law and order issues through mutually agreed programs and  mechanisms. We will strengthen cooperation to support Papua New Guinea’s law  and justice agencies, while also protecting our independent judicial systems,  strengthening our institutions and governance and safeguarding human rights.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We commit to supporting the full participation of all people in our societies,  irrespective of gender, ethnicity, disability, religion or belief or any other attribute,  consistent with our international human rights obligations. We commit to  empowering women and girls, increasing the number of women in visible leadership  roles, and ensuring gender equality in all aspects of the economy, politics and  government.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We will strengthen partnerships to promote gender equality and empower women  and girls in Papua New Guinea through all Australia-funded development programs,  as well as the effective implementation of Government of Papua New Guinea  programs and policies such as the National Strategy to Prevent and Respond to  Gender Based Violence 2016-2025.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We recognise that functional, affordable and accountable institutions are  fundamental to service delivery and good governance. We will continue to cooperate  to share knowledge, skills and experience to improve the accountability,  transparency and capability of institutions, including through institutional twinning  arrangements.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We acknowledge the Bougainville Peace Agreement is a national priority of the  Government of Papua New Guinea. We commit to continue supporting the post-referendum process through the ongoing collaboration of Papua New Guinea and  Autonomous Bougainville Government.

Pillar 2 - Close Friends, Enduring Ties

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We commit to further expanding and deepening our ties in all sectors and at all  levels of our societies.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To promote ever-closer relations, we reaffirm our commitment to the annual  Leaders’ Dialogue and Australia-Papua New Guinea Ministerial Forum, as well as

high-level meetings on security, economic, development, Torres Strait Treaty and  other issues. We will also conduct regular high-level visits and parliamentary  exchanges.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We recognise the diversity of the cultures that make up our societies. We will foster  stronger links between Australia’s Indigenous peoples and Papua New Guinea. We  acknowledge the special status of the Torres Strait and Treaty villages as places of  cultural exchange throughout our history and into the future.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We commit to promoting contemporary views of each other through the media, the  arts and cultural exchange programs.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ As two sporting nations, sport plays a critical role in connecting our people,  promoting development and unity, building leadership skills, encouraging a healthy  lifestyle and maximising economic opportunities.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We commit to working together towards streamlined travel facilitation to foster  greater travel, exchange and people-to-people linkages.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We commit to working together to strengthen Papua New Guinea’s document  identity systems and enhance levels of travel document integrity.

This includes programs such as the New Colombo Plan,  the Australia Awards Program, the Papua New Guinea-Australia Network, the  Emerging Leaders' Dialogue, and institutional partnerships at the tertiary level. We  also commit to reviving and strengthening sister-city relations between towns and  cities of both countries.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We note the importance of Kokoda in forging the bonds and friendship between the  two countries and we will continue the existing partnership under the Kokoda  Initiative, with a focus on protecting the region's unique environmental, cultural and  military heritage.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ As a necessary first step towards strengthening our current bilateral trade

architecture, we commit to reviewing and modernising the Australia-Papua New  Guinea Bilateral Investment Treaty (1990) to enhance business confidence and  investor certainty, which should also benefit Micro Small and Medium Enterprises  (MSMEs).  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We commit to upholding international trading rules, in accordance with our

commitments and obligations as World Trade Organisation members, and will  explore options for greater economic engagement, including through bilateral and  regional trade arrangements.

Pillar 6 - Near Neighbours, Global  Partners  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ As neighbours, we share many common challenges that require coordinated  solutions. Through the decades, we have demonstrated a successful, collaborative

approach to addressing these challenges. We commit to continue this approach and  to work together closely both bilaterally and as global partners.
