A SAFE AND MERRY CHRISTMAS TO OUR ADF PERSONNEL

Federal Labor wishes all of our service personnel at home and abroad a safe and merry  Christmas.

This has been a year unlike any other in Australia and around the world - and we are  thankful for the continued resolve and support of our Australian Defence Force personnel.

Throughout this challenging year, our ADF personnel have provided unprecedented and  critical support to help communities around Australia get back on their feet.

During Operation Bushfire Assist, our ADF evacuated hundreds of people stranded on the  beach at Mallacoota, supported State and Territory emergency services,  and delivered critical supplies to devastated communities.

2020 has also been defined by the coronavirus pandemic, which has seen unprecedented  community support provided by our ADF under Operation COVID-19 Assist.

Thousands of ADF personnel have assisted in contact tracing and planning, supporting law  enforcement agencies, quarantine and compliance arrangements, and repatriation efforts  across hotels and airports.

The Australian community is safer thanks to our ADF.

Australian defence personnel continue to serve around the world, promoting and protecting  our national interests. We wish those who are deployed overseas, away from their families  and loved ones, a safe and merry Christmas.

This year is a reminder of the sacrifices so many of our ADF personnel and their loved ones  make to protect and defend our country and our national interests - and the willingness of  our ADF to help and support our local communities in their time of need.

We are thankful for their service all year round, but especially at this time of year. We wish  them all a safe and happy holiday season.
