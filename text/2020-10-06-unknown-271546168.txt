FEDERAL BUDGET: MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN THE EARLY YEARS

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s 2020-21 Budget is a missed opportunity to recognise the critical role of  early childhood education and care in supporting Australia’s economic recovery.

While ECA welcomes the COVID-19 Response Package to support early education services struggling  to manage the impacts of the pandemic, including additional support for Victorian services and an  extension to the easing of the Child Care Subsidy (CCS) Activity Test, this does not go far enough—it  does nothing to reduce the cost burden on families or improve access for children at risk of long-term disadvantage.

‘Early childhood education and care has the capacity to secure more than 200 000 jobs (of which  91% are filled by womeni), support families impacted by job losses or reduced income and provide  children with quality early development experiences that can set them up for long-term education  outcomes and good mental health,’ said ECA CEO Samantha Page.

‘The consensus amongst economists and leading researchers is that increased investment in early  education would aid Australia’s economic recovery in multiple ways—boosting female workforce  participation and improving education outcomes,’ Ms Page said. ‘However the Morrison government  has chosen to overlook this.’

‘The Budget fails to address affordability issues, address workforce shortages or help women back  into paid employment.’

ECA is particularly concerned that the Budget fails to provide certainty for the National Partnership  on Universal Access to Early Childhood Education and Care (Universal Preschool), by only extending  funding for 6 months to December 2021. Numerous reports have called for a secure, long-term  funding commitment to ensure certainty for children and families.

CONTINUES OVER



























This Budget fails to include any of ECA’s recommendations as outlined in our pre-budget submission.   ECA will continue to call for:   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A 10-15% increase to the Child Care Subsidy to address affordability.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Suspension of the activity test until at least 30 June 2021.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Additional funding to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community-controlled early  learning and family support services.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A five-year national funding agreement for universal preschool.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Increased funding for children with disability and additional needs.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Professional development to help teachers/educators support children through the

pandemic.
