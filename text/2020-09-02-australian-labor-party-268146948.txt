DAVID LITTLEPROUD FAILS TO DELIVER AGRICULTURAL WORKERS’  CODE

Minister for Agriculture David Littleproud has failed to deliver a nationally consistent  Agriculture Workers’ Code because he failed to do the necessary work to get the job done.

Reports today that Chief Health Officers have rejected David Littleproud’s agriculture code  means that the Prime Minister must also reject his Agriculture Minister’s code.

On August 21 the Prime Minister tasked Minister Littleproud with establishing a nationally  consistent Agricultural Workers’ Code, to be presented in National Cabinet this Friday.  Today the Minister for Agriculture rushed together an Agmin meeting of state agriculture  ministers to try and ram through his Agriculture Workers’ Code, before it was endorsed by  the Chief Health Officers.

Media reports also point to the fact that not all States supported the code, which means the  code fails the nationally consistent test.

The Agriculture sector is facing a labour shortage which has been exacerbated by Covid-19 and border restrictions.

The Prime Minister must call in his Agriculture Minister to explain why he has not been  able to develop an Agricultural Workers’ Code - endorsed by the Chief Health Officers and  all the states - before he takes it to National Cabinet this Friday.
