E&OE TRANSCRIPT   DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA  WEDNESDAY, 7 OCTOBER 2020

SUBJECTS: Federal Budget; JobMaker.

PAT CONROY, MEMBER FOR SHORTLAND: Well last night’s Budget was a grab bag of  initiatives without a comprehensive plan to get the one and a half million unemployed  Australians back into work, and tragically this Government has declared war on every  single unemployed Australian aged over the age of 35. Let me repeat that: Mr Morrison  has declared war on every unemployed Australian aged over the age of 35 through his  wage subsidy which excludes the 920,000 Australians who are aged over the age of 35.

Just think about it for a moment. You might have lost your job during the COVID Morrison  recession or you’re about to lose it because JobKeeper is being abolished, you’re then  going onto the much reduced JobSeeker subsidy, you’re on a JobSeeker payment of only  $40 a day because of this heartless Government, and then if you’re aged over the age of  35, you then go for a job interview where - what is your chance when the person next to  you who is interviewing for the job is aged 29 and the employer gets $200 a week subsidy  to hire that 29 year old but not that 45 year old?

So the question for Mr Morrison is why is a 36 year old unemployed Australian worth less  than a 29 year old? Why is Mr Morrison making it harder for everyone aged over 35 - most  of whom have families that depend on them to get new jobs - why is Mr Morrison  potentially condemning a generation of older Australians who already face age  discrimination, who already face real challenges re-entering the workforce, into further  unemployment during this Morrison recession because of his decision to have the wage  subsidy cut out at 35? It’s a disgrace. It’s incredibly concerning, and he needs to rethink  this policy.
