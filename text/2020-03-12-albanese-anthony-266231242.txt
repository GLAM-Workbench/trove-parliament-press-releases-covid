JIM CHALMERS MP  SHADOW TREASURER  MEMBER FOR RANKIN

STATEMENT ON CORONAVIRUS ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE

Labor is supportive of the Government’s stimulus measures announced this  morning.

We will be as responsible and as constructive as possible and will work with the  Government to expedite legislation through the Parliament where required.

Labor’s priority is to protect jobs, help Australian workers, businesses, families  and communities through this difficult time, and ensure vulnerable Australians  are supported.

There are some welcome measures in this stimulus package that are worthy of  our support and we will not stand in the way of them being implemented as  soon as possible.

It remains to be seen whether these measures will be big enough or deployed  quickly enough to prevent job losses, business failures or a more serious  downturn.

This is a Government which is good at announcing things but has trouble  actually getting support out the door as we have seen with its poor record on  infrastructure investment as well as bushfire and drought relief.

Labor has some concerns with the current measures which we are prepared to  work through with the Government, including:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The lack of more substantial support for casual workers who are  required to self-isolate;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The risk that the Sickness Allowance may not be accessible, sufficient or  timely enough to support casual workers, particularly given no additional  resources have been provided to Centrelink to process these claims;



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The risk that greater reliance on the Sickness Allowance may create an  additional burden on the health system where a medical certificate is  required to claim this payment;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The lack of direct support for sole traders and the self-employed;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Concern that cash flow assistance to business is not sufficiently targeted  to ensure workers are kept on;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Concerns that measures may have come too late for some businesses

already struggling; and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The lack of detail and delayed rollout of the $1 billion regional and  community support fund, particularly given the Government’s poor track

record when it comes to integrity and implementation.  The Government must move to implement this package quickly and properly,  and be prepared to take additional steps if it becomes clear that this response  has been insufficient.
