GREENS WELCOME GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT TO COVAX





The Greens are pleased that the Government has finally announced that

Australia has joined the COVAX facility.



Australia’s participation in COVAX is critical to ensuring developing countries,

especially our neighbours in the Pacific, have access to a Covid-19 vaccine as

soon as it becomes available.



Australia has a responsibility to be part of the solution to vaccine nationalism.



The Government must continue to commit funding to COVAX to actively

support smaller nations to access Covid-19 vaccines.



It is critical that this funding continues to come out of the health portfolio. We

look forward to supporting Australia’s active engagement and participation in

COVAX.
