Campaign gets Australians to holiday in the city

The Morrison Government today launches the latest tourism advertising campaign focussed  on encouraging Australians to take a holiday in a major city.

The $6 million advertising campaign features Tourism Australia ambassadors Hamish Blake  and Zoe Foster-Blake, as it shines a spotlight on the variety of activities, events and  attractions on offer in Australia’s major cities, as part of the Holiday Here This Year  campaign.

COVID-19 has impacted tourism in major cities, with Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Gold  Coast and Perth experiencing a 34 per cent drop in tourism expenditure - equivalent to  $27.1 billion - while direct flights to capital cities are down 59 per cent, the equivalent of nine  million seats.

Federal Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Dan Tehan said every Australian should  do their patriotic duty and take a holiday in Australia this year.

“Every dollar spent on a holiday in Australia is a dollar that supports a tourism job and  business and helps support our wonderful tourism sector,” Mr Tehan said.

“So now is the time to book a holiday to explore one of our major cities, and experience the  world-class accommodation, attractions, dining and culture on offer.”

Hamish Blake said: “We have such a unique collection of clean, safe, beautiful cities with  lots in common with each other but a vibrancy that’s unique to each city. We’re extremely  lucky.

“There is always a cafÃÂ©, shop, pasta spot, or small business just around the corner waiting to  give you a memory you weren’t expecting. And at the moment our cities are full of  Australians! And that gives travelling such a unique vibe right now that we may never feel  again, it’s like a big family holiday wherever you go.”
