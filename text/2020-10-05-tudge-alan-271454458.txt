MORRISON GOVERNMENT INVESTS $1.1 BILLION IN TRANSPORT  INFRASTRUCTURE TO BOOST VICTORIAN ECONOMIC RECOVERY

The Victorian  economy will be boosted, roads will be safer and thousands of jobs created, with a $1.1  billion investment into transport infrastructure from the Federal Coalition as part of our COVID-19  economic recovery plan.

The latest funding injection builds on a series of statewide infrastructure investments from the  Commonwealth in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic which now total nearly $1.6 billion.

Key investments for Victoria include $320 million for the Shepparton Rail Line Upgrade; $208 million for  Stage 2 of the Warrnambool Rail Line Upgrade; $292 million for the Barwon Heads Road Upgrade; and  $85 million to upgrade Hall Road in Cranbourne.

Work on Stages 2 and 3 of the South Geelong to Waurn Ponds Rail Upgrade will also be accelerated with  $605 million brought forward into the forward estimates.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Tuesday’s Federal Budget would deliver funding for infrastructure  which supports the Government’s JobMaker plan and help Victoria recover from COVID-19.

“We have been working closely with state and territory governments to invest in the infrastructure that  is ready to go and can help rebuild our economy and create more jobs,” the Prime Minister said.

"These projects will keep commuters safe on the road, get people home to their loved ones sooner and  provide better public transport links for urban and regional communities.”

“As part of the COVID-19 economic recovery plan we have invested nearly an additional $1.6 billion  focused on shovel-ready projects across the state.

“This latest investment will provide another boost to the local economy and is part of our plan to  support an estimated 3,850 direct and indirect jobs across the state.”

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development Michael  McCormack said the benefits of the spending on infrastructure went beyond these projects.

“Infrastructure means jobs, it means livelihoods, it means stronger local communities and it means  building a better and more secure future for our nation,” the Deputy Prime Minister said.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the Government is focused on delivering priorities and boosting local  jobs as part of Australia’s road to recovery.

"Infrastructure helps to create jobs and to get people where they want to go sooner and safer and  unlocks the potential of our regions," the Treasurer said.

"These commitments will help to get the Victorian economy moving when restrictions are eased."

Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure Alan Tudge said the Government’s  infrastructure package for Victoria would help the state economy claw its way back and provide  certainty for business over the long term.

“This Government recognises the pain many Victorians are going through and we know that jobs and  economic stimulus through targeted infrastructure are what is needed right now,” Mr Tudge said.

“Key investments across Victoria include a major new injection in faster, more reliable regional  passenger rail services, with an additional $320 million to deliver Stage 3 of the Shepparton Rail Line  Upgrade, along with $208 million for Stage 2 of the Warrnambool Rail Line Upgrade.”

“The Australian Government will continue to invest in the Victorian economy in the coming years,  through projects such as $292 million for congestion-busting upgrades to Barwon Heads Road and a  further $85 million for upgrades to Hall Road in Cranbourne.”

Since being elected in 2013 the Liberal and Nationals Government have committed more than $31.5  billion for infrastructure in Victoria.
