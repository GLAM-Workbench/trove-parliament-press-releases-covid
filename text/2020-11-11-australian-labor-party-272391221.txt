INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION CALLS FOR AVIATION PLAN



The International Air Transport Association, the global body representing 290 airlines comprising  82% of global air traffic, has joined with the International Transport Workers' Federation in calling on  governments around the world to “prevent an employment catastrophe in the aviation industry” and  deliver a long-term plan for the future of the stricken sector.

Labor will use the Future of Australia’s Aviation Sector inquiry established this week by the Senate to  ensure the voices of aviation workers and businesses are heard and that the Morrison Government  finally delivers a plan for aviation.

As a sparsely-populated island nation Australia is uniquely reliant on domestic and international  aviation - but the Morrison Government has stood by as thousands of jobs have been lost across  and ignored calls for assistance from airlines, unions, workers and other aviation businesses.

With Australia’s international borders remaining closed for the foreseeable future, and domestic  travel still well below pre-covid levels,  it is essential that the Morrison Government continues to  support Australia’s aviation workers.

Australia’s aviation workers are highly skilled and undergo high levels of security screening - it is a  workforce that cannot be rebuilt overnight.

Instead of developing a plan for aviation, the Morrison Government has denied support to airports,  denied JobKeeper to Dnata workers, allowed Virgin Australia to fall into administration and failed to  act as Qantas sacked thousands of workers.

Rather than providing handouts for private jets and favoured airlines, the Morrison Government must  urgently support the entirety of this industry.
