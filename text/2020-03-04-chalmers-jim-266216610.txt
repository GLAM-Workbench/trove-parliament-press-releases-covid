SHADOW TREASURER

MEMBER FOR RANKIN





E&OE TRANSCRIPT

TELEVISION INTERVIEW

AFTERNOON AGENDA, SKY NEWS

WEDNESDAY, 4 MARCH 2020



SUBJECTS: National Accounts; Impact of Coronavirus on the economy.



KIERAN GILBERT, HOST: Joining me now, the Shadow Treasurer, Jim

Chalmers. Thanks for your time. You are criticising the Government for not

getting back to surplus but also calling for stimulus. Are you arguing both sides

of the street?



JIM CHALMERS, SHADOW TREASURER: Hundreds if not thousands of

times last year the Treasurer was saying two things: the Budget is back in black

and the economy's back on track. We are well within our rights to ask whether

either of those things are still true.



GILBERT: Certainly the growth was still there in the December quarter. Were

you encouraged by that? Obviously you want to see the economy as strong as

possible?



CHALMERS: The economy slowed in the December quarter.



GILBERT: It was 0.5 per cent and it was better than market expectations.



CHALMERS: It was worse than the 0.6 in the quarter before. The economy

slowed in the December quarter and we need to be upfront about that. I know

that people are talking about expectations but what matters isn't how the

number compares to what some economists were predicting. Some of them

were predicting that it would be stronger than that and some were predicting it

to be weaker than that. What matters is the data. The economy slowed in the

December quarter. It's below average, below trend, and below what Morrison

and Frydenberg inherited. There are serious challenges in the numbers which

were released today. Business investment went backwards again and it's gone

backwards for three quarters in a row. Yes the Coronavirus is going to have a

substantial economic impact but the economy was already weak and

weakening before the Coronavirus hit.



GILBERT: Do you recognise what the Treasurer says? He says it repeatedly in

answer to you and the Labor Party. He says that Australia compared to other

major developed nations is actually doing quite well.



CHALMERS: On some numbers, but not on others. For example our

unemployment rate, which is rising and at 5.3 percent now, compares really

badly with most of those countries who've got unemployment with a 3 or a 4 in

front of it. It depends what number you're talking about.



GILBERT:  You've got a division to get to in the House of Representatives so

I'll let you go.



CHALMERS: Thank you.
