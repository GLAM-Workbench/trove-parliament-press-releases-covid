MORRISON GOVERNMENT FAILS TO AUDIT NURSING HOME PPE BEFORE  COVID CRISIS

The Morrison Government failed to audit nursing homes’ stock of personal  protective equipment (PPE) in the weeks before fresh COVID outbreaks in  Victoria despite more than 1,000 aged care providers requesting access to the  national stockpile.

With reports of aged care providers in Victoria now facing shortages of PPE this  serious lapse in oversight is deeply concerning.

Labor has repeatedly raised concerns about the availability of PPE in aged care  - the Morrison Government must now ensure nursing homes have adequate  supplies.

This is more concerning evidence of the Morrison Government’s failure to  adequately prepare Australia’s vulnerable nursing homes for COVID-19  outbreak.

In the critical weeks leading up to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Victorian  nursing homes, why didn’t the Morrison Government and the aged care  regulator do more to protect older Australians?

The announcement of a Victorian aged care response centre while welcome is  sadly too late for some residents, staff and families already impacted.

Why was the Morrison Government not doing this work sooner?

We have seen the devastating impact of COVID-19 outbreaks in aged care in  Australia and across the globe.

Australia’s aged care system was broken before the COVID-19 pandemic and  this is only putting extra stress on the system.
