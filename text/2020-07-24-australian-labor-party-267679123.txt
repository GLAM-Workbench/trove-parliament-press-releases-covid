MORE EVIDENCE WHY WE NEED AN ANTI-RACISM CAMPAIGN



A survey conducted by the Asian Australian Alliance and Per Capita has revealed shocking

racism directed at Asian Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic.



The survey attracted nearly 400 respondents, most of them women, who reported racist

incidents between April and June of this year. The incidents included abuse, physical

intimidation and people being spat, sneezed or coughed on.



These findings can’t be ignored. Everyone deserves respect, especially now.

We need consistent national leadership standing against racism.



Whilst the vast majority of Australians reject racism, we can’t ignore the evidence that it

has been increasing during the pandemic.



The Morrison Government must join with Labor and take a stand against racism by

launching a national anti-racism campaign that promotes a zero-tolerance approach to

racism.



We need a bipartisan approach to tackling to racism in Australia.



You can stand with Labor against racism by joining our campaign against racism
