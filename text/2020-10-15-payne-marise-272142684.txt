FASTER JUSTICE AND MORE LOCAL JOBS:   POTENTIAL CAMPBELLTOWN COMMUNITY AND JUSTICE  PRECINCT

Campbelltown could be home to a new Community and Justice Precinct following  today’s announcement of a $1 million strategic business case to investigate its  potential development.

The precinct could house NSW and federal courts as well as co-located community  services that would deliver jobs and justice for the people of Western Sydney.

The Australian Government, the NSW Government and Campbelltown City Council  have all contributed through the Western Sydney City Deal.

Federal Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure Alan Tudge said  demand for justice services in South West Sydney will continue to grow.

“A new precinct would bring high-value jobs and career opportunities close to home  and provide improved justice services for the Western Sydney region,” Mr Tudge  said.

“The project would create a hub of services that would boost the local economy and  open new avenues of opportunity for local businesses to support the COVID-19  recovery.”

NSW Attorney General Mark Speakman said the proposal would help streamline  services in South Western Sydney to the benefit of local residents.

“The people of South Western Sydney face significant stress and cost at an already  tumultuous time in their lives by having to travel to Parramatta or Sydney CBD to  access court services,” Mr Speakman said.

“This initiative has the potential to expand Campbelltown Courthouse to include  additional Local, District and Children’s Court facilities. As well as creating faster  access to justice, this proposed precinct could improve efficiency by co-locating  justice services and possible community services.”

Liberal Senator for Western Sydney, Senator the Hon Marise Payne, said the City  Deal offered the opportunity to explore the need for a service that the people of  South Western Sydney have been asking for.

“Delivering this funding highlights how our plan for Western Sydney is putting jobs  and services at the front of our COVID-19 recovery effort,” Senator Payne said.

NSW Minister for Jobs, Investment and Western Sydney Stuart Ayres said the  strategic business case will examine how Campbelltown could benefit from a new  economic base focused on justice, and community service professions.

“A Community and Justice Precinct could provide a new professional industry to  Campbelltown, delivering jobs, education opportunities, and new services for  residents, boosting the local economy,” Mr Ayres said.

“Population growth in the Macarthur region is creating the demand for the new court  facilities to accommodate the needs of the community it serves. The region also has  the skilled workforce to fill newly created local jobs.”

Campbelltown Mayor George Brticevic said the proposed Community and Justice  Precinct had the potential to transform Campbelltown CBD.

"This Precinct could be the catalyst for a vast array of new jobs, businesses and  opportunities for locals. It also lends itself to the opportunity to house a University in  our CBD, which has been identified as a priority for the ongoing revitalisation of our  City Centre." Mr Brticevic said.

"An expanded precinct could grow the existing local legal ecosystem, creating  opportunities for businesses to expand, and crucially bring more higher-order jobs for  our community."

The Western Sydney City Deal enables the exploration of opportunities to release  surplus or underused government-owned land and assets to drive jobs growth.

The strategic business case follows an earlier Memorandum of Understanding signed  by Campbelltown City Council and the NSW Government to examine the possibilities  of a South Western Sydney Justice Precinct.

It will provide decision makers with an early indication of the best options for any  future investment and is due for completion this financial year.
