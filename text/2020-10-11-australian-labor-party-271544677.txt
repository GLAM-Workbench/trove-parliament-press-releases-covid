OUR 2.6M UNSUNG HEROES DESERVE RECOGNITION



Australia’s 2.65 million unpaid carers - carers of children with disability, of frail, elderly

parents, of partners with chronic health problems - do an incredible and selfless job.



At the best of times this care takes a toll on the physical health, the mental health and the

financial security of carers.



During COVID-19, with formal support declining and wait times growing, the nation’s

unpaid carers have taken on more responsibility than ever before.



This National Carers Week (11-17 October) is an opportunity for all of us to thank

Australia’s carers and recognise their extraordinary contribution.



But carers also deserve more than words of thanks. They need the Government to do

more to support them.





The little Government support that exists for carers pales in comparison to the estimated

$78 billion value of informal care across Australia every year.



More than 100,000 older Australians are waiting for care at home.



Parent carers of children with disability are in many cases struggling to cover the costs of

much needed allied health and therapy.



Both groups are still being refused the Coronavirus Supplement payment currently

available for job seekers.



Carers are the quiet, unsung, unpaid workforce who are so often the last failsafe between

dignity and neglect.



This week the Government should say thank you to the nation’s carers, and then have

their actions mirror their words.
