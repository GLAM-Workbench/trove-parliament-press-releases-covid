STATE OF PANIC AS HOUSING CRISIS CONTINUES





Independent Member for Clark, Andrew Wilkie, will today address Federal Parliament to  highlight the urgent need to solve the housing crisis in Tasmania.

WHEN: Approximately 3.15pm TODAY 18 March 2021  WHERE: House of Representatives (watch live at  https://aph.gov.au/news_and_events/watch_parliament)

“Rents across Tasmania have risen by an alarming 36 per cent in the past five years, with  vacancy rates remaining below one per cent,” Mr Wilkie said. “One single mum is a facing a 59  per cent hike in her rent from $220 to $350 per week.  She is now in ‘panic mode’ and may have  to move into a tent or caravan with her three-year-old son.

“It’s common to line up with more than 100 people to view a house for sale or rent, while more  than 3,500 Tasmanians are languishing on public housing waiting list. The average waiting time  for ‘priority’ applicants is 63.7 weeks. This woeful situation, compounded by a moratorium on  evictions and rent increases ending earlier this year, is about to become even worse when  JobKeeper and the life-saving JobSeeker COVID subsidy disappear.

“Disturbingly, Tasmania already holds the unenviable title of the least affordable state in which  to rent. The proportion of income required to cover rental costs is an eye-popping 29.5 per cent,  compared with a national average of 24 per cent.”
