GREATER SYDNEY INDIGENOUS VIRTUAL JOBS FAIR CONNECTS  JOB SEEKERS WITH EMPLOYERS

A virtual jobs fair showcasing employment opportunities for Indigenous Australians across  the greater Sydney region will be held on Wednesday 18 November 2020.

The Greater Sydney Indigenous Virtual Jobs Fair, funded by the Australian Government and  held in partnership with the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) and the  Department of Education, Skills and Employment, is the first to bring together Indigenous  job seekers and local businesses in greater Sydney.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said the virtual jobs fair will promote job opportunities for Indigenous Australians  across the Illawarra, Shoalhaven and Southern Tablelands regions.

“As we see COVID-19 restrictions ease, the Government is committed to connecting job  seekers with businesses looking to hire,” Minister Cash said.

“Creating jobs and boosting the skills of Australians to help them get back into work is at the  heart of the Australian Government’s recovery plan and 2020-21 Budget.

Minister for Indigenous Australians, the Hon Ken Wyatt AM MP, said the Greater Sydney  Indigenous Virtual Jobs Fair is a must for Indigenous Australians who want to connect with  businesses currently recruiting.

“The event will feature virtual presentations and workshops from industry professionals,  including representatives from the Government’s Mining Skills Organisation Pilot and  Human Services Skills Organisation Pilot, as well as help with rÃÂ©sumÃÂ©s and interview  practice,” Minister Wyatt said.

“While we can’t meet in person, online presentations provide job seekers with useful  information on how to get job ready and use online tools to boost their employability.”

The Australian Government has held jobs fairs in many locations around Australia with more  than 40,000 people having attended these events since July 2018.

The Greater Sydney Indigenous Virtual Jobs Fair is a free online event from 9.30 am to  1.30 pm (AEDT) on Wednesday 18 November 2020.

Registrations are required for the event and can be made via:  employment.gov.au/SydneyIndigenousVJF
