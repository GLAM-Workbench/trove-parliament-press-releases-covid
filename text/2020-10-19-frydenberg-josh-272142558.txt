ACCC REPORT CONFIRMS GOVERNMENT DELIVERING CHEAPER ELECTRICITY

The cost of electricity for households and businesses continues to fall across much of  eastern Australia, thanks to strong action from the Morrison Government.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), in the fourth report of  its ongoing inquiry into the National Electricity Market, has found the Government’s  Default Market Offer has led to customers on standing offers paying less for their  electricity.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the ACCC analysed data from 8.5 million bills and found  the Default Market Offer has led to cheaper prices.

“The ACCC report underlines the Government’s initiatives are delivering a fair deal on  electricity for households and businesses , particularly as Australia recovers from the  impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic,” the Treasurer said.

“The ACCC has found the median price for standing offer customers across Victoria, New  South Wales, South Australia and south east Queensland between 2018 and 2019 fell by  4.4 per cent for households, and by 7.5 per cent for small businesses.”

Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said the Government  introduced the Default Market Offer in July 2019 to protect loyal customers on standing  offer contracts from paying excessively high prices, and around 800,000 Australian  households and businesses have benefited from this action.

“Earlier this year, the government acted to expand the protections provided by the  Default Market Offer to cover people and small businesses with solar systems, and on  flexible or time-of use tariffs.”

“The Default Market Offer has clearly helped to lower electricity prices, and not just for  standing offer customers, with the average market offer price falling by up to 7.6 per  cent for residential customers, and 3.7 per cent for small businesses.

“Importantly, the Default Market Offer also acts as a reference price, making it easier  for consumers to make an apples-for-apples comparison of prices and offers from  different electricity retailers,” Minister Taylor said.

“There are great benefits in shopping around for a competitive deal, with the ACCC  finding typical residential customers could save up to $219 by switching to the median  market offer, while typical small businesses could save $424 a year.

"The Government’s free energy comparison website, energymadeeasy.gov.au compares  all available offers in the region and is an excellent resource for families and small  businesses to find the best deal for their energy needs.

“The findings of the ACCC demonstrate our policies are creating real savings for  Australians, and we will continue to deliver reforms across the electricity market that  put downward pressure on prices and ensure families and businesses have access to  affordable, reliable power.”

In addition to the Default Market Offer, the Government has taken a range of actions to  ensure Australians have access to cheaper and more reliable electricity, including:   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Introducing the ‘Big Stick’ legislation to deal with misconduct in the electricity sector

and ensure retailers pass on reductions in wholesale prices to consumers;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Getting rid of sneaky late payment penalties imposed by energy retailers;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Underwriting New Generation Investments program to improve competition and

reduce wholesale prices;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Establishing a new $1 billion Grid Reliability Fund to support investment in new

energy generation, storage and transmission infrastructure;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Extending the Consumer Data Right to energy, to make it easier for consumers to

switch provider to get a better deal; and   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Extending the ACCC’s gas sector inquiry for a further five years to ensure energy

companies continue to be held to account.

The ACCC’s fourth report into the NEM is available on the ACCC website.
