JOBS FAIRS POSTPONED AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE FOR  COVID-19



In response to the latest expert medical advice provided by the Australian Health Protection  Principal Committee (AHPPC), Commonwealth, State and Territory governments have  agreed to provide public advice against holding non-essential, organised public gatherings of  more than 500 people from Monday 16th March 2020.

As a result, the upcoming Perth, Newcastle, Melbourne North and Melbourne West Jobs  Fairs have been postponed. It is appropriate that we take measures to ensure we are  mitigating any unnecessary risk to ensure the community remains as safe as possible.

This advice applies for the following events:

- Perth Jobs Fair on Tuesday, 17th March   - Melbourne West Jobs Fair on Friday, 27th March  - Melbourne North Jobs Fair on Tuesday, 31st March  - Newcastle Jobs Fair on Wednesday, 8th April



We look forward to rescheduling these particular Jobs Fairs in the near future.
