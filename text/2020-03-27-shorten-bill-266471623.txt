BILL SHORTEN MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR THE NDIS  SHADOW MINISTER FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICES  MEMBER FOR MARIBYRNONG



JUST SAY SORRY, PAY THE VICTIMS, & REDIRECT CENTRELINK STAFF  TO VIRUS

When Labor announced last year that Robodebt victims would pursue a class  action against the Government, Stuart Robert said it was a stunt and there  were no plaintiffs.

There are more than 11,000 plaintiffs and potentially 700,000 Australians in the  broader group of victims. And now secret communications that have emerged  today reveal Ministers Robert, Anne Ruston and Christian Porter are planning  on settling the case and refunding 400,000 fake debts worth about $550m.

Master of disaster Stuart Robert needs to settle this case immediately, restore  public confidence in Centrelink by allowing the court to be the independent  umpire, and pay the victims back their money as well as interest.

Most importantly he needs to immediately redirect the hundreds of Centrelink  staff - who are working on limiting the Governmentâ€™s Robodebt exposure - back  to the frontlines of helping their fellow Australians with their social security  needs in this time of national crisis.

Mr Robert is fresh from making up fairy tales about hostile foreign cyber-attacks  to seek to cover his failure to bolster the myGov site from crashing from a  foreseeable surge in users.

The last thing he should do is let stubborness about his original disaster,  Robodebt, compound the damage from his latest disaster - his ill-prepared  Centrelink response to the coronavirus crisis.

Take the staff off the Robodebt files, Minister, and put them to work on the  safety net for a million displaced Australians.

For Stuart Robert, sorry seems to be the hardest word. He should immediately



front the Australian public and apologise to the multitude of Robodebt victims  who have suffered so much because of this scandal.
