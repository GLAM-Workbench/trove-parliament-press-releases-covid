URGENT STEP UP IN COVID SUPPORT FOR PAPUA NEW  GUINEA NEEDED

The Morrison Government needs to provide urgent and comprehensive  assistance to Papua New Guinea, which is grappling with a severe COVID-19  outbreak.

So far this month our Pacific neighbour has recorded 376  new coronavirus cases, however due to low testing rates this number could be  much higher.

Yet again the Morrison Government is behind the eight ball when it comes  to stepping up in the Pacific.

The Minister for International Development and the Pacific Zed Seselja claims  the “Government is watching the current rise of COVID-19 in PNG closely and  with concern” but it appears the Morrison Government has been caught flat-footed.

Not only is this outbreak putting huge pressure on Papua New Guinea’s health  system, it’s already creating challenges in Australia - including higher risks of  transmission to the Torres Strait Islands and via fly-in workers.

Last year Labor warned that if the Morrison Government didn’t provide



adequate support to the Pacific during this pandemic, then other  countries would fill the void. The Chinese government has already dispatched a  medical team to Papua New Guinea this week.

It has been almost two weeks since the last community transmission of COVID-19 in Australia, and the vaccine rollout is still in its very early days.

If the outbreak in Papua New Guinea is not quickly contained, it could again  spread throughout Australia.

The Government must ensure its Pacific Step-up is more than just a slogan and  provide Papua New Guinea with emergency medical assistance, testing and  health infrastructure to ensure this COVID-19 outbreak  doesn’t inflict catastrophic damageon our Pacific neighbour.
