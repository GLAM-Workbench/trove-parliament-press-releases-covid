SKY NEWS FIRST EDITION WITH PETE STEFANOVIC

Ã¢ÂÂ¨TUESDAY, 22 SEPTEMBER 2020Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã¢ÂÂ¨



SUBJECTS: Extradition of alleged child sexual abuser Malka Leifer; Angus Taylor’s

energy ‘technology roadmap’; inaction on climate change; Victorian coronavirus

cases and reopening.



PETE STEFANOVIC, HOST: A court in Jerusalem has ruled former Melbourne principal

Malka Leifer can be extradited to Australia to face 74 child sex abuse charges. The 52 year

old is accused of sexually assaulting three female students during her time at an ultra-orthodox school in Melbourne's southeast. She fled to Israel 12 years ago when the

allegations first surfaced. Earlier this month the Supreme Court ruled she is mentally fit to

face trial. Leifer has denied the allegations and is expected to appeal the extradition

decision. Well joining me now is Victorian Labor MP Josh Burns. Josh, good to see you.

Thanks for joining us this morning. So what was your reaction to that news yesterday? It's

something that you've been quite passionate about in recent times.



JOSH BURNS, MEMBER FOR MACNAMARA: Well, it's good to see you Pete and you're

right. It was a bit of relief, to be honest. It was over nine years ago that the three sisters,

Dassi, Nicole and Elly, first put their police statements in and first made statements against

Malka Leifer. Nine years, who would have thought that this thing was going to take at least

nine years and for a while there Malka Leifer was living free in Israel. And there were even

reports of her making similar assault and sort of child sex abuse issues in Israel in her

community in Israel. And eventually she was taken into custody and arrested and she has

a very, very well resourced legal team, and they have done a very good job of keeping this

case rolling for longer than it should have. But finally, yesterday, we heard the news that

we have been waiting for for a long time that she'll be extradited to Australia.



STEFANOVIC: There's likely to be an appeal though. I mean, given it's taken so long to

get to this point. It's not, she's not gonna be extradited tomorrow is she. I mean, there's

going to be an appeal, which, which is going to probably drag this out even further,

wouldn't you think?



BURNS: Yeah, the defence have already said that they will appeal which was to be

expected. I think there is a couple of points to say, first of all, is that the higher courts have

thrown out the latest rounds of appeals pretty quickly in the case and in doing so have

made public comments saying that this has gone on way too long already. I mean, this

court case has had, I think yesterday was the 72nd court case hearing of this trial. So this

should have been a simple extradition matter that has gone on way, way too long. So you

know, there will be appeals, but we are hopeful that they'll be thrown out as the recent

ones have been really quickly and then Malka Leifer will be sent back to Australia.



STEFANOVIC: It's what happens with extraditions though, they take time, don't they, and

this is another example of that?



BURNS: Well, I mean, it shows the independence of the Israeli judicial system that, as

frustrating as it might be, they are an independent system and I think that despite, you

know, all of the will of the world, there are processes that have to be followed. But one

thing that I would say is that is that the effort of the three sisters from my electorate in

Melbourne, Dassi, Nicole and Elly, has been herculean. They have stood up in the face of

really difficult circumstances. They've copped public criticism from their own community

and they have stood up for what is right and you know, when Malka Leifer gets on a plane

to Australia, it will be because of the awareness and the seriousness and the elevation of

this case. And for political figures, we all we've asked consistently is that this matter be

dealt with in a timely way, and that the court processes are not delayed any further.



STEFANOVIC: Alright, just on a few other issues today, Josh, so Angus Taylor is going to

be announcing his long-awaited Technology Roadmap today. So there are five top priority

low emission technologies, he's going to be announcing - clean hydrogen, batteries, green

steel and aluminium, carbon capture among them. What does Labor think of it?



BURNS: Well, I think Pete this is the 22nd energy announcement by this Government.

That's a lot more energy announcements than you need. The one big, glaring omission of

the announcement that I've read today, and unless you've seen something that I haven't

Pete, is that there is nothing in here that the industry- the energy industry - has been crying

out for. There is nothing in it, to provide the certainty for investment to make sure that

Australians can have cleaner and cheaper energy into the future. I mean, the cheapest

form of energy generation at the moment, not according to me, but according to AEMO,

the government's own Energy Agency, is firmed renewable energy. That's solar and wind

with some form of firming agent, whether they be battery or hydro, or whatever it is. That is

the cheapest form of energy. And there's nothing in this energy plan that transitions

Australia towards a cleaner and cheaper energy, which means Australian households are

going to have higher energy bills because of Angus Taylor. And it means that our duty as

Australians, as part of a global effort to tackle climate change is undermined by this 22nd

announcement. I mean, we really need to be doing better. And Angus Tyler has yet again

put a lot of pies in the sky but hasn't delivered things that will give us cheaper and cleaner

energy.



STEFANOVIC: But the Government has already said that it's dropped, you know, the

renewable energy parts of it anyway, solar and wind, because there is enough investment

in the private sector to kind of do it without Government help. Would you accept that that is

the case?



BURNS: Well, there is investment, but it's slowing down because of the inaction by Angus

Taylor and Scott Morrison. I mean, there are things that the Government could be doing at

a much better rate like, like investing in transmission lines that would connect up new

energy generation and allow for a much speedier investment of renewable technology. And

to be honest, you know, there is a lot of investment in renewable technology, because we

have a country which has an abundance of potential when it comes to renewable

technology. We're quite a hot country and we have huge coastlines. I mean, it's not a

surprise that businesses want to invest in renewable technology, because we have such a

competitive advantage as a country on this form of technology. So the answer, I mean, it's

a bit of a cheeky answer when they run those lines, because yes, there is investment, but

is it anywhere near where it could be? Not even close.



STEFANOVIC: So will you support the top priority low emission technologies, would Labor

support them?



BURNS: Oh look, we'll wait and see what Angus Tyler spouts out today. But I think that our

clear focus is cleaner and cheaper energy. From what I've seen, there's nothing in this

announcement today and the other thing, Pete, is that Scott Morrison is becoming

increasingly isolated by not having a 2050 net zero emissions target. I mean, this is not

radical policy. This is something that National Farmers Federation has adopted, the

Business Council's adopted, that all the states and territories have adopted including the

Liberal ones. Scott Morrison and Angus Taylor are sort of announcing roadmaps and press

releases and doing the things that Scott Morrison likes to do. But where are they going?

They're leading us towards more inertia and higher energy prices. And unfortunately, not

having a plan to tackle climate change.



STEFANOVIC: Just finally, and briefly, Josh, we've got some numbers at the bottom of the

screen there - three deaths, 28 cases, that's the latest from Victoria. I notice some positive

news regarding what people actually think about Daniel Andrews' leadership on the front

page of The Oz this morning, according to the latest opinion polls, that they do support

what he's doing. When would you like to see restrictions eased now that there seems to be

a stabilisation of cases, well more than a stabilisation, that they're heading in very much

positive territory, leaving the deaths aside for the moment?



BURNS: Look Pete, I think the answer from everyone from the Premier down is as soon as

it's safe to do so. And we've had low cases in the last few days, which is such a relief

compared to what we're seeing in Europe at the moment, as four and a half thousand

cases plus a day in the United Kingdom and Spain and France. And the US is a basket

case when it comes to the number of deaths and cases, they've had 200,000 deaths, let

alone cases. So I think Victorians were relieved that we aren't seeing the sort of makeshift

morgues that are happening across the world. But you know, it's obviously come at a price

and, and it's been difficult for people. So I think Victorians have done an amazing job, they

are resilient and they have helped create probably some of the best reduction in

transmission rates in the world. And so as soon as it's safe to do so we'll be coming out of

these restrictions and hopefully having a summer where we can move around Victoria and

the rest of the country.



STEFANOVIC: Okay, Josh Burns, thanks for your time. Always good to talk, we'll chat to

you soon.





BURNS: See you, Pete.
