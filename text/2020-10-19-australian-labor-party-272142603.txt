OFFICE FOR WOMEN LOCKED OUT OF MORRISON GOVERNMENT POLICY

MAKING



New answers provided to the Senate have revealed the Office for Women was not  consulted on the design of the Morrison Government’s key policy responses to COVID-19.

Despite women falling further behind because of the COVID-19 crisis, the Office for  Women did not brief the Morrison Government on its early access to superannuation,  JobKeeper or JobSeeker policies prior to policy decisions.

It has also emerged the Office for Women did not brief the Morrison Government on  Budget measures including JobMaker and the latest round of tax cuts.

Australian women are being left behind under the Morrison Government and now it is  clear they are being locked out of decision making.

Women already retire with half the superannuation balances of men, why did the  Morrison Government not look at how its early access policy might make this situation  worse?

At the peak of coronavirus restrictions earlier this year, more than 1 million women had  no work whatsoever.

Why did the Morrison Government not look at how JobKeeper and JobSeeker policies  might impact on this?

Day after day we see new evidence of the terrible impact COVID-19 is having on  Australian women, but in response this Government fails to act.

In this year’s Budget, there was no new funding for frontline service providers to support  women and their children escaping domestic violence.

There was nothing new to properly drive down the gender pay gap. There was nothing

to bolster women’s superannuation or economic security in retirement.

There was no plan to lift the permanent rate of JobSeeker from $40 per day, tackle  insecure work, create opportunities for women or to improve access to childcare.

Under Scott Morrison and his Government, Australian women continue to be left out  and left behind.
