MORRISON GOVERNMENT INVESTS $1.3 BILLION IN TRANSPORT  INFRASTRUCTURE TO BOOST QLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY

The Queensland economy will be boosted, roads will be safer and thousands of jobs created, with a $1.3  billion investment into transport infrastructure from the Federal Coalition as part of our COVID-19  economic recovery plan.

The latest funding injection builds on a series of statewide infrastructure investments from the  Commonwealth in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic which now total more than $1.7 billion.

Key investments for Queensland include $750 million for Stage 1 of the Coomera Connector (Coomera  to Nerang); $112 million for the Centenary Bridge Upgrade in Brisbane; $76 million for Stage 2 of the  Riverway Drive Upgrade between Allambie Lane and Dunlop Street in Townsville; and $42 million for the  Mt Lindesay Highway Upgrade between Johanna Street and South Street in Jimboomba.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Tuesday’s Federal Budget would deliver funding for infrastructure  which supports the Government’s JobMaker plan and help Queensland recover from COVID-19.

“We have been working closely with state and territory governments to invest in the infrastructure that  is ready to go and can help rebuild our economy and create more jobs,” the Prime Minister said.

"These projects will keep commuters safe on the road, get people home to their loved ones sooner and  provide better transport links for urban and regional communities.”

“As part of the COVID-19 economic recovery plan we have invested an additional $1.7 billion focused on  shovel-ready projects across the state.

“This latest investment will provide another boost to the local economy and is part of our plan to  support an estimated 5,150 direct and indirect jobs across the state.”

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development Michael  McCormack said the Government is focused on delivering priorities and boosting local jobs as part of  Australia’s road to recovery.

“We will draw on local businesses to stimulate local economies through these projects,” the Deputy  Prime Minister said.

“Infrastructure means jobs, it means livelihoods, it means stronger local communities and it means  building a better and more secure future for our nation.”

Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure Alan Tudge said the Government’s  infrastructure package for Queensland would put key infrastructure back on track in Brisbane, South-east Queensland and across the State.

“This will not only drive major infrastructure projects on the economic road back from the pandemic,  but build the economy and provide certainty for business over the long term” Mr Tudge said.

“Key investments across Queensland include $750 million for the Coomera Connector Stage 1 (Coomera  to Nerang) and $112 million for the congestion-busting Centenary Bridge Upgrade over the Brisbane  River.”

“We will continue to invest in the Queensland economy in the coming years, including through  commitments such as $76 million for Riverway Drive Stage 2 (Allambie Lane - Dunlop Street) in  Townsville and $42.4 million to upgrade Mt Lindesay Highway between Johanna Street and South  Street.”

Since being elected in 2013 the Liberal and Nationals Government have committed more than $28.5  billion for infrastructure in Queensland.
