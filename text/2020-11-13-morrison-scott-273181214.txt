ASEAN-AUSTRALIA AND EAST ASIA SUMMITS

On Saturday, I will participate in a virtual ASEAN-Australia Summit and a virtual East Asia Summit,  alongside Australia’s key Indo-Pacific partners.

ASEAN remains at the heart of Australia’s vision for a peaceful, stable, inclusive, sovereign, prosperous  and resilient Indo-Pacific. ASEAN has a central role to play in the region’s recovery and the post COVID-19 regional order.

At the ASEAN-Australia Summit, I will discuss Australia’s role in our region’s response to COVID-19  recovery. Australia is proud to be a Strategic Partner of ASEAN and its oldest Dialogue Partner.

At the East Asia Summit, I will highlight the importance of our collective COVID-19 recovery being guided  by the principles set out in the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific - by transparency, inclusivity, good  governance and respect for international law.

The East Asia Summit is the Indo-Pacific’s premier forum for discussion of our region’s most pressing  strategic challenges. Never has this been more important as the world continues to tackle COVID-19.

I will also deliver an address at the ASEAN Business and Investment Summit on Friday night and  participate in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Summit on Sunday.

RCEP brings together Australia’s top regional trading partners into a single economic framework and will  link us more closely with this dynamic region.

I congratulate Vietnam for its stewardship as ASEAN Chair during a very challenging year and for Prime  Minister Phuc’s hosting of the ASEAN-Australia, East Asia and RCEP Summits.
