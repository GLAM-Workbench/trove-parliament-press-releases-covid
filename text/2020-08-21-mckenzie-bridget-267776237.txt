MEDIA RELEASE

National Cabinet must develop a National approach to border

closures and quarantine protocols

Wodonga-based Nationals Senate Leader Bridget McKenzie is calling on National

Cabinet to deliver a nationally consistent approach to border closures and quarantine

processes.

While state leaders are engaged in a political game of one-upmanship regional

communities, hundreds of kilometres from COVID-19 hotspots, are being torn apart.

Protecting the health of the Australian community is the number one priority but

because of city-centric parochialism our farms are at a standstill and businesses are

being forced to shut without the medical evidence to justify state border closures.

We need a national standard approach to inbound quarantine with stringent checks,

and equivalent processing systems that will give confidence as we learn to live with

the virus.

The reality is in the present system some state governments are simply not up to it,

as evidenced in Victoria.

National Cabinet also needs to produce a common-sense national border-closure

strategy, to avoid issues such as:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A three year old Murrayville girl with cancer unable to see Adelaide-based

specialist for treatment

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A Queensland mum with cancer and newborn, and her partner stranded in

Wodonga

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Farmers being told to fly their sheep, hay and header with them to Sydney

then quarantine in a hotel before they can access their NSW properties

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A Queensland farmer unable to access their NSW property to feed their cows

being told by a bureaucrat to euthanise them.

It is time for leadership at National Cabinet to end nonsensical state-imposed work

and travel arrangements.

After months of immense emotional and mental pressure, COVID-19 free regional

Australians need a plan.
