HELPING MINING WORKERS UPSKILL AND RESKILL

The mining sector will benefit from improved qualifications to help address existing and  future workforce challenges.

A qualification design trial is now underway as part of the Morrison Government’s Skills  Organisations Pilots, which are helping the nation’s training system respond to industry  needs.

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia  Cash, said the Morrison Government is committed to delivering faster and improved training  for the Australian mining sector.

“We want to better meet the current and future training needs of employers and employees,  which is especially important now to support our COVID-19 economic recovery,” Minister  Cash said.

“That’s why this trial is so important, because it will help simplify and streamline  qualifications to provide the mining sector with the skills it needs to flourish.”

The first qualification trial is being run by the Mining Skills Organisation Pilot, one of three  industry-led organisations funded by the Morrison Government to test and trial ways to  improve the VET system.

The trial will test the following concepts:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Qualifications based on appropriately grouped occupation and skills clusters to enable  broader vocational outcomes, improve individual mobility and labour market  resilience, and increase the pool of available talent for employers

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Simplified training products that reduce the level of prescriptive conditions in current  qualifications and make better use of industry and educational expertise,  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Use of short form training products with improved pathways advice to support  students to rapidly upskill or reskill to pursue new career opportunities.

Minister Cash said the trial presents a significant opportunity to design and test new  evidence-based approaches to improving the national VET training system.

“Technology is changing traditional occupations and demanding new skills. The Mining  Skills Organisation Pilot will help develop and test a new apprenticeship for mobile plant

diesel mechanics that incorporates critical skills that cross traditional occupations,” Minister  Cash said.

The Trial is just one part of the Morrison Government’s ongoing commitment to improving  the existing VET system, including measures to improve industry engagement and provider  quality. For more information visit: https://www.skillsreform.gov.au
