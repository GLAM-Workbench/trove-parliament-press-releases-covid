OPEN ARMS IPSWICH MOVE

VETERANS and their families in Ipswich, Queensland, now have greater access to mental health  support services with the opening of a new permanent Open Arms - Veterans & Families Counselling  office tomorrow.

Minister for Veterans’ Affairs Darren Chester said the previous Open Arms office in Ipswich was a  satellite office and that the new permanent location further demonstrated the Government’s  commitment to improving the mental health and wellbeing of Australian veterans and their families.

“The new office, centrally located at 10 Brisbane Street, is in close vicinity to RAAF Base Amberley,  the largest Air Force base in Australia, and the place of employment for thousands of current  Australian Defence Force (ADF) members and their families,” Mr Chester said.

“The new location offers veterans and their families a modern, well equipped, easily accessible and  family friendly site with additional counselling rooms and large open office spaces to ensure they are  well-looked after.”

In what has been a challenging year, Open Arms has seen a 35 per cent increase in counselling  sessions provided to the ex-service community in the last 12 months, and this increase is expected  to continue throughout the coronavirus pandemic.

Senator for Queensland Paul Scarr, who is based in the Ipswich region, said the increase in those  accessing counselling services illustrated that the message about seeking mental health support was  being heard, particularly in the ex-service community.

“Reaching out for support is incredibly important during uncertain times and veterans and their  families in the areas surrounding RAAF Amberley here in Queensland will now have a better  resource to provide that support,” Senator Scarr said.

“If you are a veteran or family member who may be struggling or in need of additional support, I  encourage you to call Open Arms 24/7 on 1800 011 046 or visit OpenArms.gov.au to find more  about services available.”

Open Arms was founded by our Vietnam veterans and is their enduring legacy of ensuring all  veterans and their families can access free and confidential mental health support.
