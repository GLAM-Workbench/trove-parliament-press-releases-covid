Supporting more women in STEM

The Morrison Government will support up to 500 women to study science, technology,  engineering or mathematics.

Minister for Education Dan Tehan today launched the new $24.8 million Women in STEM  Program that offers a four-year program to study an industry-supported higher education  Diploma or Advanced Diploma in STEM while working in paid employment.

“Australia needs more women working in science, technology, engineering or mathematics  to help drive our COVID-19 recovery,” Mr Tehan said.

“Our Government has a plan to address the underrepresentation of women in STEM, where  currently less than a third of the STEM-qualified workforce are women.

“The Women in STEM Program will create more opportunities for women. It’s part of our  Government’s plan to encourage more Australians into areas of expected job demand.”

Education providers will receive grant funding to deliver eligible STEM programs, and  participating employers will receive up to $5,000 a year per employee.

Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Karen Andrews said the Government is  committed to ensuring women can excel in STEM fields.

“I am a huge advocate for encouraging women to pursue their interest in STEM,” Minister  Andrews said.

“Studying STEM can open up enormous job opportunities, especially given STEM skills are  increasingly important across all industries.”
