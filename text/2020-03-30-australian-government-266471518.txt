Supporting businesses to retain jobs

Last updated: 30 March 2020

FACT SHEET

ECONOMIC RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS

The Government is introducing a subsidy program to support employees and  businesses. The JobKeeper Payment is designed to help businesses affected by  the Coronavirus to cover the costs of their employees’ wages, so that more  employees can retain their job and continue to earn an income.

Keeping Australians in work and businesses in business will lay the foundations  for a stronger economic recovery once the Coronavirus c risis passes.

JOBKEEPER PAYMENT

Summary

The economic impacts of the Coronavirus pose significant challenges for many businesses - many of which  are struggling to retain their employees.

Under the JobKeeper Payment, businesses significantly impacted by the Coronavirus outbreak will be able  to access a subsidy from the Government to continue paying their employees. This assistance will help  businesses to keep people in their jobs and re-start when the crisis is over. For employees, this means they  can keep their job and earn an income - even if their hours have been cut.

The JobKeeper Payment is a temporary scheme open to businesses impacted by the Coronavirus.  The  JobKeeper Payment will also be available to the self-employed.

The Government will provide $1,500 per fortnight per employee for up to 6 months.

The JobKeeper Payment will support employers to maintain their connection to their employees. These  connections will enable business to reactivate their operations quickly - without having to rehire staff -  when the crisis is over.

Eligibility

Employers (including non-for-profits) will be eligible for the subsidy if:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ their business has a turnover of less than $1 billion and their turnover will be reduced by more than  30 per cent relative to a comparable period a year ago (of at least a month); or

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ their business has a turnover of $1 billion or more and their turnover will  be reduced by more than  50 per cent relative to a comparable period a year ago (of at least a month); and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the business is not subject to the Major Bank Levy.

Employers must elect to participate in the scheme. They will need to make an application to the Australian  Taxation Office (ATO) and provide supporting information demonstrating a downturn in their business. In  addition, employers must report the number of eligible employees employed by the business on a   monthly basis.

Eligible employers will receive the payment for each eligible employee that was on their books on  1 March 2020 and continues to be engaged by that employer - including full-time, part-time, long-term  casuals and stood down employees. Casual employees eligible for the JobKeeper Payment are those  employees who have been with their employer on a regular basis for at least the previous 12 months as at  1 March 2020. To be eligible, an employee must be an Australian citizen, the holder of a permanent visa, a  Protected Special Category Visa Holder, a non-protected Special Category Visa Holder who has been  residing continually in Australia for 10 years or more, or a Special Category (Subclass 444) Visa Holder.

Eligible employers who have stood down their employees before the commencement of this scheme will  be able to participate. Employees that are re-engaged by a business that was their employer on   1 March 2020 will also be eligible.

In circumstances where an employee is accessing support though Services Australia because they have  been stood down or had their hours reduced and the employer will be eligible for the JobKeeper Payment,  the employee will need to advise Services Australia of their new income.

Self-employed individuals will be eligible to receive the JobKeeper Payment where they have suffered or  expect to suffer a 30 per cent decline in turnover relative to a comparable prior period (of at least a  month).

Where employees have multiple employers - only one employer will be eligible to receive the payment.  The employee will need to notify their primary employer to claim the JobSeeker Payment on their behalf.  The claiming of the tax free threshold will in most cases be sufficient notification that an employer is the  employee’s primary employer.

Payment process

Eligible employers will be paid $1,500 per fortnight per eligible employee. Eligible employees will receive, at  a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight, before tax, and employers are able to top-up the payment.

Where employers participate in the scheme, their employees will receive this payment as follows.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If an employee ordinarily receives $1,500 or more in income per fortnight before tax, they will  continue to receive their regular income according to their prevailing workplace arrangements. The  JobKeeper Payment will assist their employer to continue operating by subsidising all or part of the  income of their employee(s).

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If an employee ordinarily receives less than $1,500 in income per fortnight before tax, their employer  must pay their employee, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight, before tax.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If an employee has been stood down, their employer must pay their employee, at a minimum,   $1,500 per fortnight, before tax.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If an employee was employed on 1 March 2020, subsequently ceased employment with their  employer, and then has been re-engaged by the same eligible employer, the employee will receive, at  a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight, before tax.

It will be up to the employer if they want to pay superannuation on any additional wage paid because of  the JobKeeper Payment.

Payments will be made to the employer monthly in arrears by the ATO.

Timing

The subsidy will start on 30 March 2020, with the first payments to be received by employers in the first  week of May. Businesses will be able to register their interest in participating in the Payment from  30 March 2020 on the ATO website.

Budget impact

This measure is expected to cost $130 billion across 2019-20 and 2020-21.

Self-employed

Melissa is a sole trader running a florist. She does not have employees. Melissa’s business has been in  operation for several years. The economic downturn due to the Coronavirus has adversely affected  Melissa’s business, and she expects that her business turnover will fall by more than 30 per cent  compared to a typical month in 2019.

Melissa will be able to apply for the JobKeeper Payment and would receive $1,500 per fortnight before  tax, paid on a monthly basis.

Worker with multiple jobs

Michelle currently works two permanent part-time jobs, at an art gallery during weekdays, and at the  local cafÃÂ© on the weekend. Due to the impact of the Coronavirus, the gallery has closed and Michelle has  been stood down without pay under the Fair Work Act.  Michelle continues to work at the cafÃÂ© delivering  take-away orders.

Michelle can only receive the JobKeeper Payment once, from the employer from whom she nominates as  her primary employer. As Michelle only claims the tax free threshold from her job at the art gallery, this  will be treated as her nomination of the art gallery as her primary employer.

The art gallery is eligible for the JobKeeper Payment. The art gallery will pass the JobKeeper Payment on  to Michelle, so she will receive $1,500 per fortnight before tax. During the application process, the art  gallery will notify the ATO that Michelle receives the payment from them. The art gallery is also required  to advise Michelle that she has been nominated to the ATO as an eligible employee to receive the  payment.

The cafÃÂ© is not eligible to receive the JobKeeper Payment for Michelle. The income that Michelle receives  from her job at the cafÃÂ© does not change her entitlement to the JobKeeper Payment she receives from  the art gallery.

Employee made redundant after 1 March

Miles worked as a permanent part-time personal trainer at a gym for six months and was made  redundant on 20 March 2020 in response to the Government directive that gyms close. Miles was not  entitled to redundancy pay due to his length of service.

In response to the announcement of the JobKeeper Payment, the gym decides they want to re-engage  Miles so they are well placed to resume their operations once the Coronavirus restrictions are lifted.

After being made redundant, Miles had registered an intent to claim with Services Australia for access to  the JobSeeker Payment and the Coronavirus Supplement. Miles is single, with no children and in total he  would be eligible to receive $1,124.50 before tax per fortnight.

If Miles chooses to be re-hired by the gym, under the JobKeeper Payment he will receive $1,500 a  fortnight before tax while he is stood down. Miles will need to advise Services Australia of his income. He  is no longer eligible for the JobSeeker Payment and the Coronavirus Supplement from Services Australia  as a result of receiving the JobKeeper Payment.

Employer with 5 employees who all currently get paid more than $1,500 per fortnight

Sara runs a landscaping company, and employs five full-time gardeners. Sara is paying her employees  $1,700 per fortnight before tax. She expects that her turnover will decline by more than 30 per cent over  the coming months and that she will either need to lay staff off, or reduce their wages significantly.

As a result of the JobKeeper Payment, Sara will be able to keep employing every gardener, and only  needs to pay the $200 wage cost per fortnight before tax per employee above the $1,500 per fortnight  (before tax) JobKeeper Payment.
