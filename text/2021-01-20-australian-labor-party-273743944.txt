NEW FIGURES REVEAL SHAMEFUL WAIT FOR AGED CARE UNDER  MORRISON

New figures released today by the Productivity Commission show just how  broken our country’s aged care system is under the Morrison Government.

Older Australians needing high level home care are now waiting more than two  years for care they have been approved for and some are waiting almost three  years.

The wait for older Australians to enter residential care has blown out by more  than 200% under the Coalition to 148 days.

These are shameful figures. It is clear the Morrison Government has completely  failed older Australians.

Scott Morrison has racked up a trillion dollars in debt but waiting times for  critical services for vulnerable older Australians just keep blowing out.   In a wealthy country like Australia no one should wait more than two years for  care they need and have been approved for.

This is the latest evidence of the Morrison Government’s aged care failures.

Over the three years leading up to mid-2020, more than 30,000 older  Australians died waiting for home care that had been approved.

685 older Australians tragically died in aged care homes from COVID-19  because the Morrison Government didn’t have a plan.

The Aged Care Royal Commission’s interim report detailed the crisis in aged  care was titled ‘Neglect’.

It called for urgent action more than a year ago but there are still 100,000 older



Australians waiting for home care.

Day after day, evidence continues to mount of serious neglect in aged care. But  all we see from the Morrison Government is excuses and smoke and mirrors.

Scott Morrison needs to accept responsibility and fix it.

Neglect. That’s the legacy of this Government when it comes to aged care.

Australians deserve better.
