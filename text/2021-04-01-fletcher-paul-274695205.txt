More than $4.8 million for NSW’s creative sector to RISE

Eighteen creative organisations across NSW will share in more than $4.8 million under the second  batch of grants from the Australian Government’s $200 million Restart Investment to Sustain and  Expand (RISE) Fund, which is designed to reactivate live performance venues and events.



Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher MP,  said the latest RISE funding would support arts and entertainment organisations throughout NSW to  restart, re-imagine or create new cultural and creative activities.

“NSW is renowned for its vibrant and diverse creative sector, which supports cultural expression,  community and social wellbeing, and provides significant employment and economic benefits for the  state,” Minister Fletcher said.

“That is why we’re committed to reactivating this vital sector, with more than $4.8 million to flow  immediately to 18 diverse projects throughout NSW, creating 13,300 job opportunities across the  sector.”

One of the largest grant recipients in NSW is Sydney Film Festival, which will receive more than  $530,000 for its 68th film festival, creating more than 260 job opportunities.

To support its 2021 festival, The Sydney Fringe will receive more than $370,000 to present the work  of 2,500 independent artists in 1,600 individual public performances.

One of Australia’s leading performing arts companies, Bangarra Dance Theatre will also receive more  than $220,000 for their latest production showcasing the culture of the Torres Strait.

On 25 March the Government announced the RISE Fund will be boosted with an extra $125 million to  support around 230 projects and up to 90,000 jobs, building on an original commitment of $75 million.

In November 2020 more than $60 million in funding was announced under Batch One of the Fund.

The successful New South Wales projects listed below are part of 61 projects funded under Batch Two  of RISE. The full list of Batch Two recipients will be announced in the coming weeks at:  www.arts.gov.au/covid-19-update
