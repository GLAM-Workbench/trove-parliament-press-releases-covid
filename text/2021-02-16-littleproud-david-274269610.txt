Vaccine biosecurity a government priority

Ã¯ÂÂ· Biosecurity’s critical role in safe importation of COVID-19 vaccines  Ã¯ÂÂ· Every effort being made to ensure that there are no delays at the border

Australian Government biosecurity efforts have contributed to the safe importation of the  first batch of COVID-19 vaccines into our country.

Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management David Littleproud said his  department played an important role in managing biosecurity risks posed by imported  products, including human therapeutics such as vaccines.

“I am proud that my department, the Department of Agriculture, Water and the  Environment, has played an important role in facilitating the importation of the essential  Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines into Australia,” Minister Littleproud said.

“The first of many consignments arrived in Australia on Monday.

“These vaccines will very soon be available to our vulnerable community members and  front-line officers.

“In partnership with the Department of Health, we ensure that imported therapeutics such  as these vaccines will not cause harm to humans, animals or the environment.

“While these COVID-19 vaccines have been assessed as safe, it is important that all  imported therapeutics meet the strict requirements of the Australian Government.

“My department has ensured that companies such as Pfizer are well informed about what  they’ll need to do when importing these valuable vaccines.

“In close collaboration with other border agencies, every effort is being made to ensure  that there are no delays at the border for these very important vaccines.

“The urgency and volume of these imports have combined to make for an unprecedented  collaborative effort at the border.

“As a result of this important work, Australian’s can be assured of the quality of imported  vaccines.”
