Westerdam cruise ship passengers



The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) is no longer  recommending passengers from the Holland America Westerdam cruise ship  undertake 14 days of self-isolation on return to Australia to manage novel  coronavirus (COVID-19).

State and territory health authorities are now contacting passengers to advise them  of this updated public health advice.

This advice—which aligns with the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention—is made on the basis that significant testing of passengers has not led  to any further cases beyond the one initial passenger.

Cambodian authorities have tested large numbers of Westerdam cruise ship  travellers who are still in Cambodia and all have tested negative to date.

The AHPPC has concluded, like our colleagues in the United States, these  passengers present a low risk of COVID-19 and the proportionate response is to  remove the restrictions.

The AHPPC made its original decision out of an abundance of caution to protect  the Australian public’s health.

Like all of our decisions so far, this was based on the best medical advice at the  time and on the basis of a positive case on the ship. Self-isolation in Australia  allowed time for further testing and a better understanding of the situation for  passengers from the Westerdam.
