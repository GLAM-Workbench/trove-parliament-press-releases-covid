ANOTHER LOOPHOLE DISCOVERED IN

LIBERALS’ $50 MILLION CASHLESS DEBIT CARD



The Government has admitted to yet another loophole in its $50 million cashless debit card

which allows participants to purchase alcohol as it continues to foreshadow a national

rollout of the card.



The cashless debit card prohibits the purchase of certain items or services - such as

alcohol or gambling - from ‘declared’ outlets based on what is known as their ‘merchant

category code’.



For example, ‘Duty Free Stores’ and ‘Gambling Transactions and Betting’ merchants are

unable to process transactions by patrons using the cashless debit card.



Last night, Labor senators discovered a merchant code - 5812: ‘Eating Places and

Restaurants’ - which is currently not on the list of ‘declared’ merchants.



When asked by Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, “does that mean that I could use my

Cashless Debit Card at the restaurant with the Merchant Category Code 5812 to buy

alcohol?”, a Department of Social Services official answered, “yes.”





This is the latest loophole in a series which has exposed the defectiveness of the

Government’s multimillion dollar ideological boondoggle.



In October, following intense scrutiny from Senator McCarthy, it was discovered that

participants could use a credit to purchase alcoholic items or gambling services, and then

use the cashless debit card to pay off the credit.



The Senate Community Affairs Committee also heard about the rapidly increasing cost of

the card.



In the 2015/16 financial year, the Government spent $10.982 million on the card.



In 2016/17 - $8.076 million.



In 2017/18 - $15.132 million.



And in 2018/19 - $16.176 million - for a grand total of $50.4 million - or $4,333 per

participant.



And now the Government wants to expand its defective card nationally.



International evidence shows that mandatory income management does not work.



What was clear from estimates last night is that the Government is unprepared for the

expansion of the cashless debit card.



At a time when the community is calling for an increase to Newstart to pre-empt the

economic uncertainty ahead of the coronavirus pandemic, the Government is more

obsessed with its multi-million dollar boondoggle.
