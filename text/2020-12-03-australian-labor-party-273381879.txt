INTERNATIONAL DAY OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY



Today is the International Day of People with Disability.



This is an occasion to celebrate the achievements and contributions of people with disability.



But we must also seize the opportunity to take stock of the unfinished business that remains to

improve the lives of people with disability - one in five Australians.



The Coalition has failed to deliver on the promise of Labor’s National Disability Insurance

Scheme across a range of areas:



Deaths of NDIS participants by neglect in their homes. The NDIS underspent by billions. The

failure to deliver a national disability strategy. Failing to listen and consult with the disability

community before rushing through independent assessment changes. Omitting people with

disability entirely - not mentioning them once - from the national pandemic emergency plan.



Australians with disability being, in the words of the Royal Commission, “neglected” and “left

feeling invisible and ignored” during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.





But in marking this special day we must not forget the positive progress that has been made.



Faced with seemingly insurmountable odds during the pandemic, we have seen resilience and

ingenuity as people with disability, their loved ones, carers and support teams met unique

challenges.



And, despite Coalition mismanagement the promise of the NDIS remains, and the Scheme is

still an Australian achievement.



It is also a result of a grassroots campaign by the Australian disability community and their

efforts to organise, unite and demand a greater slice of our civic pie.



Labor will continue to work for NDIS participants and for a stronger national disability support

network for all.



We have further to go. But today we celebrate the achievements.



Thank you to every Australian with a disability, for all they contribute to our community.
