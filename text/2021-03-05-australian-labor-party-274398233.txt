JULIE COLLINS MP

SHADOW MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE

MEMBER FOR FRANKLIN



RELEASE OF NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL WORKFORCE STRATEGY



The Morrison Government cannot step back from the responsibility of driving the

reform of Australia’s agricultural workforce after finally releasing the National

Agricultural Workforce Strategy today.



Despite the Strategy sitting on Minister David Littleproud’s desk since October

2020, today’s release is accompanied with little real action.



The Strategy provides an important blueprint for addressing long-term issues in

Australia’s agricultural workforce and Labor will consider the recommendations

closely.



Labor wrote to Minister Littleproud calling for him to finally step up and respond to

this report with a real plan to address gaps in Australia’s agriculture workforce.



It is incredibly disappointing the Morrison Government has sat on this report for

months while crop losses across the country have mounted due to farm labour

shortages.



Earlier this week, ABARES forecast farm labour shortages would hit production,

hurting farmers and causing prices of fruit and vegetables to increase 7-29 per

cent.





The cost of crop losses has already reached $45 million.



Minister Littleproud and the Nationals have been more interested in shameless

politicking than showing leadership for Australian farmers.



Restrictions related to COVID-19 have highlighted longstanding issues in

Australia’s agriculture workforce, which is why leadership is needed now.



The Morrison Government must do better for Aussie farmers.



Labor thanks the National Agricultural Labour Advisory Committee, including the

Chair, Mr John Azarias, and those who contributed to this strategy.
