$49 million to showcase world-class Indigenous arts

The Morrison Government has today announced that more than $49 million will flow to Australia’s world-renowned Indigenous visual arts sector, providing new opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander artists and supporting a professional and viable visual arts industry.

The funding, which is part of the Indigenous Visual Arts Industry Support (IVAIS) program, will support  54 Indigenous visual art organisations including art centres, art fairs, regional hubs and service  organisations.

Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher MP, said annual IVAIS  funding supports around 8,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists and 500 Indigenous arts  workers.

“Indigenous-owned art centres are at the heart of Australia’s internationally renowned Indigenous visual  arts movement and are an important contributor to local economies,” Minister Fletcher said.

“The IVAIS funding will create new opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists from  across the country and provide funding certainty to organisations that support their work,”

Funded projects include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $70,000 in 2020-21 for First Hand Solutions Aboriginal Corporation to contribute to the delivery  of the National Indigenous Art Fair in Sydney in 2021 where artwork can be bought directly from  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists from remote communities.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $550,000 over five years to support the Arts Law Centre of Australia’s Artists in the Black and  Licensing the Right Way projects to improve licensing outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander artists and to build best practice within the Indigenous visual arts industry across  Australia.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $240,000 over three years to support Numburindi Arts to provide services to visual artists based in  the Numbulwar community located in South-East Arnhem Land on the Gulf of Carpentaria in the  Northern Territory.

“This funding is part of the Government’s long-standing support for Australia’s world-class Indigenous  visual arts sector. I’m pleased that the organisations supported through today’s announcement continue to  facilitate and promote ethical conduct in the Indigenous visual arts sector,” Minister Fletcher said.

The IVAIS program provides annual funding through an open competitive grants process and through  targeted funding opportunities.



The Government invests around $750 million in the arts and cultural sector in each year through its regular  funding programs.

The funding announced today is in addition to $7 million of support for Indigenous artists and arts centres  through the Relief and Recovery Fund COVID-19 package announced on 9 April 2020.
