CLIVE PALMER’S UNAUTHORISED VACCINE DISINFORMATION

Clive Palmer is spending thousands of dollars on vaccine disinformation in communities right  throughout Australia.

Mr Palmer’s pamphlets have been letterboxed in my electorate in Adelaide, and have been  also found in New South Wales and Queensland.

Mr Palmer, in his unauthorised leaflets, says he is “very concerned by the emergency use of  this vaccine on the general population”.

I have written to the Australian Electoral Commission seeking advice as to whether the flyer is  in breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act.

The COVID-19 vaccine rollout and the Government’s response to the pandemic are clearly  issues which will influence the way electors vote at the next federal election, which could be  held as early as August this year.  The subject matter makes it more likely that the dominant  purpose of the flyer is to influence the way electors vote at the election.

Clive Palmer is the leader of the United Australia Party.  Although the flyer does not mention  the United Australia Party, electors associate Clive Palmer with the party.

The Morrison Government is spending over $24 million on advertising the vaccine rollout but  its silence on Mr Palmer’s vaccine disinformation is deafening.
