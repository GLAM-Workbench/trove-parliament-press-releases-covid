$1.1 BILLION TO SUPPORT MORE MENTAL HEALTH, MEDICARE AND DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE SERVICES

More help will be given to millions of Australians battling the devastating impacts of coronavirus with a  $1.1 billion package which boosts mental health services, domestic violence support, Medicare  assistance for people at home and emergency food relief.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said more support would be rolling out immediately to deal with the  secondary effects of the health and economic crisis caused by coronavirus.

“As we battle coronavirus on both the health and economic fronts with significant support packages in  place and more to come, I am very aware many Australians are understandably anxious, stressed and  fearful about the impacts of coronavirus and what it brings,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.

“We are focused on saving lives and saving livelihoods and this new support package will provide much  needed care and help to so many Australians facing hardship at no fault of their own.

“We will get through this crisis by staying together, by supporting each other and ensuring that no  Australian, even though we have to be isolated, should have to go through this alone.”

Medicare support at home - whole of population telehealth



To provide continued access to essential primary health services during the coronavirus pandemic, $669  million will be provided to expand Medicare-subsidised telehealth services for all Australians, with extra  incentives to GPs and other health practitioners also delivered.

Australians will be able to access support in their own home using their telephone, or video  conferencing features like FaceTime to connect with GP services, mental health treatment, chronic  disease management, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health assessments, services to people with  eating disorders, pregnancy support counselling, services to patients in aged care facilities, children with  autism, after-hours consultations and nurse practitioners.

Providing the opportunity to get health services at home is a key weapon in the fight against coronavirus  while limiting unnecessary exposure of patients and health professionals to the virus, wherever  treatment can be safely delivered by phone or videoconferencing. This will take pressure off hospitals  and emergency departments and allow people to access essential health services in their home, while  supporting self-isolation and quarantine policies.

The GP bulk billing incentive will be doubled for GPs and an incentive payment will be established to  ensure practices stay open to provide face to face services where they are essential for patients with  conditions that can’t be treated through telehealth. The new arrangements will be in place until 30  September 2020, when they will be reviewed in light of the need to continue the fight against  coronavirus.

Domestic violence support

An initial $150 million will be provided to support Australians experiencing domestic, family and sexual  violence due to the fallout from coronavirus.

Google is seeing the highest magnitude of searches for domestic violence help that they have seen in  the past five years with an increase of 75 per cent and some services are already reporting an increase in  demand.

The funding will boost programs under the National Plan to reduce Violence against Women and their  Children including:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Counselling support for families affected by, or at risk of experiencing, domestic and family  violence including men’s behaviour change programs which will provide a short, medium and

longer term response to support men.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 1800RESPECT, the national domestic, family and sexual violence counselling service, which  already answers around 160,000 calls a year.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Mensline Australia, the national counselling service for men that provides support for emotional

health and relationship concerns for men affected by or considering using violence.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Trafficked People Program to support particularly vulnerable cohorts such as victims of human  trafficking, forced marriage, slavery and slavery-like practices.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Support programs for women and children experiencing violence to protect themselves to stay

in their homes, or a home of their choice, when it is safe to do so.

A new public communication campaign will roll out to support those experiencing domestic violence  over this period and to ensure those affected know where they can seek help.



Minister Payne and Minister Ruston will convene a COAG Women’s Safety Council meeting on Monday  to discuss with the states and territories how to best deliver this funding to support local responses to  this issue.

Mental health support

An initial $74 million will be provided to support the mental health and wellbeing of all Australians.

The Government’s digital mental health portal, Head to Health (www.headtohealth.gov.au), will be a  single source of authoritative information and guidance on how to maintain good mental health during  the coronavirus pandemic and in self-isolation, how to support children and loved ones, and how to  access further mental health services and care.

A new national communications campaign, delivered in conjunction with the National Mental Health  Commission, will provide information about maintaining mental wellbeing, raise awareness of the signs  of when you or a loved one needs to get additional assistance, and where to find further information,  support and care.

$10 million will be provided to create a dedicated coronavirus wellbeing support line, delivered by  Beyond Blue, to help people experiencing concern due to a coronavirus diagnosis, or experiencing stress  or anxiety due to employment changes, business closure, financial difficulties, family pressures or other  challenges. The Government welcomes an additional $5 million contribution from Medibank to Beyond  Blue to support this vital initiative.

$14 million will bolster the capacity of mental health support providers who have experienced an  unprecedented surge in call volumes with funding increasing their capacity, including $5 million for  Lifeline and $2 million for Kids Helpline. The funding will also bolster other existing services,  including digital peer-support to people with urgent, severe and complex mental illness who may be  experiencing additional distress at this time.

Health workers, who will be at the frontline of the pandemic, will get dedicated mental health support  through digital platforms developed to provide advice, social support, assistance in managing stress and  anxiety, and more in-depth treatment without having to attend in-person sessions.

To ensure that older Australians in aged care are not socially isolated despite visiting  restrictions, $10 million will be provided to the Community Visitors Scheme. The funding will mean extra  staff to train volunteer visitors, who will connect with older people in aged care online and by phone,  and assist older Australians keep in touch with the community and loved ones.

To help younger Australians stay on track in their education and training and prepare them for the  workforce, $6.75 million will be provided to deliver the headspace digital work and study service and  eheadspace. Mentors and headspace vocational specialists working in an integrated team will offer  technical and life skills, providing a comprehensive digital support service for all young Australians  during the COVID-19 pandemic and after.

For Indigenous Australians, whose elders and communities are particularly vulnerable to the impacts  coronavirus, Gayaa Dhuwi (Proud Spirit) Australia will develop culturally appropriate mental health and

wellbeing resources. These will be available and easily accessible across a range of platforms, including  print, podcast, NITV, Indigenous print media and internet/social media platforms.

$28.3 million will be utilised to continue to deliver psychosocial support to Commonwealth community  mental health clients for a further 12 months. This will allow additional time for people with severe and  complex mental illness to complete their applications and testing for support under the National  Disability Insurance Scheme.

Relief services for vulnerable Australians

An additional $200 million will be provided to support charities and other community organisations  which provide emergency and food relief as demand surges as a result of coronavirus.

Given the unprecedented nature of the situation, emergency relief services are being heavily relied  upon and this demand will increase.

The Community Support Package will provide flexible funding to boost support to services where  demand is quickly increasing, including:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Emergency Relief which will help vulnerable Australians who need assistance with bills, food,  clothing or petrol and increase and retain workforce capacity including volunteers.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Assistance for food relief organisations to source additional food and transport for emergency  relief service providers, and rebuild workforce capacity.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Immediately scale-up services through the National Debt Helpline — which is often the first  point of contact for people experiencing financial difficulties, and to support one-on-one tele-

financial counselling.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Creating a short-form Financial Counselling course through Financial Counselling Australia to  train new financial counsellors to boost the workforce, potentially providing hundreds of new

jobs.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Expanding access to safe, affordable financial products through the No Interest Loan Scheme  which provides an immediate financial relief alternative to other high-risk, high-interest  products such as credit cards and payday loans.
