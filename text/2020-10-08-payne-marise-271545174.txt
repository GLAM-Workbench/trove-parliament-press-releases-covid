SENATOR THE HON MARISE PAYNE  Minister for Foreign Affairs  Minister for Women

MEDIA RELEASE  VISIT TO SINGAPORE

I will visit Singapore from 8-9 October. I look forward to meeting again with Prime  Minister Lee Hsien Loong, affirming our two countries’ strong friendship, which is  underpinned by our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP).

I will also meet with Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and Minister of State for  Social and Family Development and Education Sun Xueling.

Australia and Singapore have a wide-ranging and cooperative relationship. We will  focus on our nations’ work together, including in responding to the significant health,  economic and security challenges facing the international community and our region  due to COVID-19.

My visit is an opportunity to advance Australia’s interests and reaffirm our shared  commitment to promoting a stable, inclusive and prosperous region, with ASEAN at its  core, as we work towards COVID-19 recovery. Our COVID-19 cooperation with  Singapore spans discussions on technology and tracing, vaccines and vaccine  multilateralism, supply chains and food security.

Our economic relationship is strong, supported by a shared belief in the benefits of open  and rules-based economic and trade frameworks.
