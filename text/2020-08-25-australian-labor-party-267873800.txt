MORE AVIATION JOB LOSSES



Qantas’s latest announcement is another example of why the Morrison Government urgently needs  a plan for aviation.

Coming so soon after previous announcement of 6,000 job losses at Qantas and 3,000 at Virgin  Australia, these losses will be another devastating blow for Australian workers and an industry in  crisis.

Labor’s thoughts are with all Qantas workers and their families on what will be another difficult day.

Australia will need our aviation industry as we emerge from this crisis, but it cannot survive on a wing  and a prayer.

With Qantas reporting a loss of $2 billion, airports reporting collective losses of $300 million per  month, and capital city airports such as Canberra and Hobart being forced to close on certain days  the industry cannot wait.

It was revealed last week at the Senate Select Committee on COVID-19 that the Deputy Prime  Minister has not even bothered replying to 5 separate letters from the Australian Airport Association.

We also know that the Prime Minister refused to provide Qantas guarantees regarding the future of  JobKeeper the night before the airline was forced to cut 6,000 jobs.

The Morrison Government’s inaction is costing jobs.

Airlines, airports and unions are united in calling for a national aviation plan, the Morrison  Government must listen.
