Release of Newmarch House review



The Australian Government today releases the review findings into the spread of COVID-19  at Sydney aged care facility Newmarch House.

In offering further condolences to the families of the 19 residents who died as a result of the  outbreak between April and June, Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Richard  Colbeck said lessons learned are being implemented to offer greater protections as we  continue to combat the pandemic.

“The outbreak at Anglicare’s Newmarch House was incredibly challenging and underlined the  impact this infection can have within an aged care facility,” Minister Colbeck said.

“The Australian Government is committed to learning from the experience at Newmarch House  and to doing all we can to ensure aged care providers are prepared to address future outbreaks  so that residents receive safe and quality care.”

In June 2020, the Chief Medical Officer and now Secretary of the Department of Health,  Professor Brendan Murphy, commissioned Professor Lyn Gilbert and Adjunct Professor Alan  Lilly undertook the independent review.

They consulted with stakeholders, including family members of residents, to provide a  comprehensive break down of what led to the outbreak and how authorities responded to it.

Minister Colbeck said the review is an important resource for all levels of government which  would improve the management of potential future outbreaks and inform advice and guidance  to support the aged care sector.

“We continue to integrate the learnings from Newmarch and infections in Victoria into the  national response as outbreaks occur,” Minister Colbeck said.

Changes already implemented include:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Ensuring early identification of all COVID-19 cases via immediate and repeated testing  of all residents and staff as soon as the first case is identified;  Ã¯ÂÂ· Actions to reinforce compromised management;  Ã¯ÂÂ· Immediate engagement of advocacy group Older People’s Advocacy Network (OPAN)

to ensure services and information are available to providers, residents and their  families;   Ã¯ÂÂ· The provision of support from the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre (in Victoria)  to improve communication, staff and management support;  Ã¯ÂÂ· Expansion of surge workforce providers for facilities affected by outbreaks; and  Ã¯ÂÂ· Practical additional infection control training, including support from AUSMAT.

Additionally, the Australian Government is supporting the Aged Care Quality and Safety  Commission in its monitoring efforts.

The Commission continues to take decisive steps related to the issuing of corrective action to  ensure providers and management respond appropriately and levels of care are met.

Minister Colbeck said throughout the pandemic there has also been regular, ongoing  communication to the aged care sector about managing outbreaks, including providing updated  advice incorporating learnings from Australia and other countries.

The Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) outbreak guidelines are supported  by a ‘First 24 hours’ document, published by the Department, which also provides aged care  facilities with practical steps they should take in order, following the identification of a positive  COVID case.

“Each of these implemented actions, are another step toward reinforcing the sector and  ultimately protecting senior and vulnerable Australians,” Minister Colbeck said.

“The Government’s measures to tackle COVID-19 in aged care now exceeds $1 billion.”
