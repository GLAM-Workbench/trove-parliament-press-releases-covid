MORRISON GOVERNMENT SUPPORTING THE  CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IN THE TOP END

8 September 2020



The Morrison Government is supporting small to medium sized businesses across the  Northern Territory with millions of dollars in funding for the construction industry.

Minister for Defence, Senator the Hon Linda Reynolds CSC said the investment  provides greater surety for the construction industry in the Top End as the nation  continues to recover from COVID-19.

“The Morrison Government will inject $190 million into existing major projects over the  next two financial years to fast-track the delivery of facilities and infrastructure in  Defence locations across the Top End,” Minister Reynolds said.



Minister for Defence Industry, Melissa Price said an additional $300 million will be  invested in the existing national Estate Works Program over 2020-21 and 2021-22 to  help with sustaining the Defence Estate.

“This additional funding builds on the $870 million investment in the Estate Works  Program announced in May 2020, and which is providing opportunities to local  businesses across Australia, including small businesses in the NT,” Minister Price said.

Senator for the Northern Territory, Dr Sam McMahon said Larrakeyah Defence Precinct,  RAAF Darwin, Robertson Barracks, Mt Bundey Training Area and the Delamere Air  Weapons Range will benefit from the works package.

“These works will be tailored to ensure that small to medium sized enterprises can bid  for this work and will be incorporated into both current and new projects so the Defence  Estate is safe and fit-for-purpose for the members of the Australian Defence Force,”  Senator McMahon said.

Local industry will be able to tender for works including a health centre, explosive  ordnance storage, a gymnasium, mess facilities and additional airfield works.
