MULTICULTURAL GROUPS SAY JASON WOOD’S POSITION IS

UNTENABLE



Major multicultural organisations have described the position of the Assistant Minister for

Multicultural Affairs, Jason Wood,  as ‘untenable’ following a social media post on the

Sunday night.



The Chinese Community Council of Australia, the National Sikh Council of Australia and

the Multicultural Communities Council of NSW have joined together to call for Wood to

resign or to be removed from his position by Scott Morrison.



“It would not be surprising that Mr Wood’s inflammatory remarks have given

credibility to those people raising concerns about the Asian-American medical staff

treating their children, at the Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne last week …



“We believe that Mr Wood’s remarks as an assistant minister for multiculturalism is

highly inappropriate... his position in the multiculturalism portfolio is now

untenable.”





Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Dr Anthony Pun, OAM,  National President of the Chinese Community

Council of Australia and Mr Ajmer Singh Gill, National President of the

National Sikh Council of Australia.



In the context of community concern in relation to Coronavirus, and many reports of racism

being directed to Chinese Australians, and Asian Australians more broadly, it is imperative

that he delete his Facebook post in which he said “When will they learn?” and apologise.



These remarks are inappropriate, offensive and may undermine public health efforts.



If he can’t stand up for Chinese Australians now, he shouldn’t remain in his position.



Jason Wood has form - Australians remember his divisive and appalling African gang

rhetoric.



Now is the time for Australians to pull together, and to reject racism.
