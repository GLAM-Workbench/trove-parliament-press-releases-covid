LEGACY WEEK 2020



This week is Legacy Week 2020, the annual national appeal that raises awareness and

funds to support the families of Australian veterans.



Legacy is an outstanding community organisation that provides services to families of

veterans who lose their lives or their health as a result of their military service.



These efforts are ably supported by veterans, servicemen and women, and other

volunteers from all walks of life.



Labor values our veterans and their families, and understands the unique nature of military

family life and that families can also be deeply affected by military service.



Legacy Week will help around 52,000 beneficiaries through funding essential services and

help provide educational resources to children.



This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened many of the pressures that our

veterans and their families are experiencing.



That is why it is more important than ever that we help organisations like Legacy in their

vital work, so Australians are encouraged to buy a badge, donate or consider becoming a

volunteer.





Due to coronavirus emergency, this year many of the normal Legacy Week fundraising

events will not be able to go ahead in order to protect the health and safety of participants

and Legacy volunteers.



Badge Day is Friday, 4 September (Thursday, 3 September in Western Australia) and

donations can be made at the Legacy Week website www.legacyweek.com.au



Legacy merchandise, including their famous badges and bears, can also be purchased

online at the Legacy shop at www.legacyshop.com.au



The Legacy Australia National Launch Commemorative Wreathlaying Ceremony will be

hosted by the Australian War Memorial on Monday, 31 August 2020.
