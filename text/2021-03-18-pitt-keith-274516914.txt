NEW GRANTS TO UNLOCK BEETALOO BASIN POTENTIAL

Australia’s gas-fired recovery has taken another step forward with the launch of new  grants to support further exploration of the Northern Territory’s Beetaloo Basin.

Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia Keith Pitt said $50 million in  grants will be provided through the Beetaloo Cooperative Drilling Program.

“The program is expected to deliver approximately 10 additional exploration wells in  the Beetaloo by 2022, and bring forward at least $150 million of private investment  from companies.

“This Commonwealth grants program will support gas operators to speed up  exploration and development of the Beetaloo Basin,” Minister Pitt said.

“These grants are a key component of our Government’s agenda to bring gas from  this world class resource into the market by at least 2025.

“The Beetaloo Cooperative Drilling Program is part of the Beetaloo Strategic Basin  Plan and the Government’s $224 million commitment to the Beetaloo,” Minister Pitt  said.

Senator for the Northern Territory, Dr Sam McMahon, says it will be a major local  economic driver.

“The Plan is expected to generate significant development in the Top End, creating  up to 6,000 jobs over the next 20 years and helping Australia remain a world leader  in gas,” Senator McMahon said.







“This investment by the Morrison-McCormack Government will provide new  opportunities for thousands of Territorians and ensure the NT can emerge from the  COVID-19 pandemic in a strong position.”

The Beetaloo Cooperative Drilling Program will provide grants of between $750,000  and $7.5 million, up to a total of $50 million, to gas companies to support exploration  that occurs before 30 December 2022.
