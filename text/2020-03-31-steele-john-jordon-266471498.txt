DISABLED PEOPLE & CARERS LEFT OUT OF $130 BILLION STIMULUS

Tuesday 31st March, 2020

Australian Greens Disability spokesperson Senator Jordon Steele-John said  the Government's failure to extend the $550 COVID-19 supplement to people  receiving the Disability Support Pension (DSP) and Carer Payment in  Yesterday's $130 billion stimulus package was an indictment on their attitude to  disabled people and carers.

"It's clear that this government is still not taking the needs of disabled people  and their families seriously enough in their response to the COVID-19  pandemic," Steele-John said.

"The Disability Support Pension and Carer Payment exist in recognition of fact  that disabled people and carers have higher everyday costs and face significant  barriers to entering the workforce. Those costs and barriers have increased, not  decreased, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Disabled people and carers are also having to factor in higher costs for  transport, medical supplies and support workers, as well as unplanned costs for  personal protective equipment to stay safe when venturing out into the  community.   "To be quite honest, I'm shocked that people receiving the disability support  pension and carer payment have been left out of a such a massive stimulus  package.

"Everyone on the disability support pension and the carer payment needs to be  able to access the $550 supplement to help them get through this crisis."
