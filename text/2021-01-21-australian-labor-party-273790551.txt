2.1 MILLION AUSTRALIANS UNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED

Today’s ABS Labour Force figures confirm that while there is recovery in the  jobs market, there are still too many Australians unemployed or underemployed  with no plans from the Morrison Government to help those looking for work.

While we welcome the increase in employment, there are also almost 2.1 million  Australians who are unemployed or looking for more work.

Despite this increase in employment, for the year to December, the number of  unemployed people rose by more than 220,000.

The December ABS Labour Force figures confirm that:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢           912,000 Australians are unemployed.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢           1,181,100 workers are underemployed.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢           There are still 93,100 fewer jobs than in February 2020, before Covid-19  struck.

While parts of the economy are recovering, there are many sectors and  Australian workers that are still struggling.

What looks like a recovery on paper still feels like a recession to many  Australians. For this to be the right kind of recovery, we need to make sure that  there's job security and wages growth for ordinary working families.

It is not a good enough recovery if it leaves people stranded in joblessness,  underemployment or on weak wages, which mean they can't provide for their  families.



With the unemployment rate not expected to return to its pre-crisis level within  four years, Scott Morrison doesn’t have a goal to achieve full employment, let  alone a plan to realise it.

Australians need and deserve a plan from the Morrison Government to promote  growth, protect and create jobs, support business and set us all up for the  recovery.
