E&OE TRANSCRIPT

DOORSTOP INTERVIEW

PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA

THURSDAY, 4 FEBRUARY 2021



SUBJECTS: Victoria; Comments by the RBA Governor on Jobseekers.



RICHARD MARLES, DEPUTY LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY: Let me just

start by saying, as a Victorian, we can all understand the anxiety that's being filled in Victoria

today. But I take heart, and I think every Victorian and every Australian should from the quick

response of the Victorian Government and the fact that it's underpinned by the best medical

advice. It's really important that we are following that advice. And when you look at what has

occurred around the country, and the way in which state Premiers have been acting in when

there's been the slightest hint of an issue, the medical advice is saying go, hard go early. And

to this point in time, that's been successful. I don't think anyone is taking anything for granted

in terms of how this plays out. But at this moment in time, we're in good hands in terms of

medical advice, which has been provided, and we should take a great deal of confidence with

the swiftness of the Victorian Government's response.



JOURNALIST: What did you make of the RBA Governorâ€™s comments yesterday about the

Jobseeker rate?





MARLES: Well, his comments reflected comments that we've been making for some time now,

that the underlying rate of Newstart as it existed before the coronavirus pandemic started was

too low. It doesn't surprise me at all, that that sentiment is echoed by the Reserve Bank

Governor.
