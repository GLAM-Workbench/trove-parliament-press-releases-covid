INITIAL TOWNS, SUBURBS AND HUBS FOR COVID-19 VACCINE

Australia’s COVID-19 Vaccination Program will commence from next week. People in  priority groups who are most at risk and who need protection the most - will receive a  vaccine first.

The rollout will begin with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, and following the approval by the  Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) on Tuesday, will include the AstraZeneca/Oxford  vaccine from early March.

The initial priority groups include aged care and disability care residents and workers,  frontline healthcare workers, and quarantine and border workers.

Minister for Health and Aged Care, Greg Hunt reaffirmed that Australia’s vaccine strategy is  strong and on schedule.

“Australia will begin rolling out the COVID-19 Vaccination program from next week,”  Minister Hunt said.

“This week the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has arrived in the country and the TGA has  approved the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine. These are two outstanding vaccines that will be  available to people in Australia free of charge.”

Frontline healthcare workers and quarantine and border workers will receive the vaccine  through Pfizer hubs run by states and territories. In addition, a Commonwealth led in-reach  vaccination workforce will ensure residential aged care and disability care residents and staff  receive their vaccines.

Minister Hunt said the staged approach to the rollout would ensure those who need the most  protection get it first.

“Our frontline border and quarantine workers, and people living and working in residential  aged and disability care facilities will be the first to receive their vaccines,” Minister Hunt  said.

“The vaccination program will save and protect lives. Both of our vaccines will prevent  serious illness. That is our primary goal.”

States and territories will initially have 16 Pfizer vaccination hubs operational across  Australia. These first hubs will be at:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (NSW)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Westmead Hospital (NSW)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Liverpool Hospital (NSW)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Monash Medical Centre Clayton (VIC)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Sunshine Hospital (VIC)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Austin Health (VIC)  Ã¯ÂÂ· University Hospital Geelong (VIC)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Gold Coast University Hospital (QLD)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Cairns Hospital (QLD)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Princess Alexandra Hospital (QLD)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Royal Adelaide Hospital (SA)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Flinders Medical Centre (SA)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Perth Children's Hospital (WA)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Royal Hobart Hospital (TAS)  Ã¯ÂÂ· The Canberra Hospital (ACT)  Ã¯ÂÂ· Royal Darwin Hospital (NT)

The remaining phases will be rolled out as the number of vaccines grows.

Vaccines will be available across additional settings including GP clinic and community  pharmacy. The staged rollout of COVID-19 vaccines is guided by Australia’s COVID-19  Vaccine National Rollout Strategy.

The aim of the vaccination program is to save and protect lives. To keep people out of  intensive care and off ventilators. Both vaccines approved for use in Australia do that very  well.

Protecting people from serious illness is, and must, be the first priority
