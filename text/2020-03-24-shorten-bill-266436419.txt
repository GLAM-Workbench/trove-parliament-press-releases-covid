CUT THE QUEUES AND HELP AUSTRALIANS IN NEED

The Morrison Government needs to get serious about helping the hundreds of  thousands of Australians who need to access our nation’s safety net in this time  of crisis.

Queues around the nation, crashing websites and so-called phone ‘help lines’  that are understaffed and with hours-long waiting times are not good enough.

It is not sufficient for Government Services Minister Stuart Robert to fail to have  the myGov website and Centrelink shopfronts prepared for foreseeable  demand, to confect a story (later retracted) about a hostile denial of service  attack on the site and then flippantly say ‘my bad’ about the whole mess.

There are things the Government can do to ease these problems and reduce  and ‘triage’ these queues.

Face to face services should of course observe appropriate social distancing  and staff should where appropriate wear masks and protective gloves.

But constructive solutions include:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ They should reinstate some of the more than 4,000 experienced and  trained workers cut in recent years and deploy them to the Centrelink  shopfronts and phonelines to deal with the surge of inquiries.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ They should start speaking to those standing in the queues and start

triaging and referring customers to online or phone services where  appropriate. They could be giving them the paperwork in advance of  reaching the counters.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A one page form could be distributed to those standing in lines at  Centrelink - Customer Reference Numbers could be issued there and  then and identity checks could be undertaken later over the phone. But  applicants’ intent to claim would be lodged and the applicants would be  eligible for backpay.



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Separate hotlines should be established for new Centrelink customers  and those seeking to obtain a CRN to use online.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ There should be an ability to register for a callback from Centrelink  (rather than staying on hold indefinitely).  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Clear instructions as to what the identity requirements are should be

broadcast on Government platforms and on the automated hotline  recording so people can be ready in advance.  This is the real social safety net Australians will need to get through the  challenges posed by the coronavirus in coming months.

I want to acknowledge former senior Centrelink officers and members of the  public who had input into these suggestions.

These are our suggestions made in good faith. If the Government has better  ideas we are open to them. But there should be no more excuses, only  solutions.
