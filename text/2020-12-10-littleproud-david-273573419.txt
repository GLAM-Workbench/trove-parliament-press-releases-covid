Labor attacks and abandons Australian farmers yet again

Senior Labor figures Senator Kristina Keneally and Ed Husic have today insulted the  integrity, reputation and good name of Australian farmers while also discouraging workers  from working on Australian farms this harvest season.

Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of the Nationals, David Littleproud, said that  Labor deserves to be condemned for suggesting that all Australian farmers abuse and  exploit their workers and called on the Opposition Leader to apologise to the farm sector.

Australian farmers who have been through floods, fires, drought and COVID-19 don’t  deserve to be insulted and maligned by two Sydney based MPs who would not have a  clue about farming.

Right now, our farmers are facing an unprecedented workforce shortage as a result of  COVID-related travel restrictions, and the government has pulled out all stops to support  them at this critical time.

Rather than support the government’s latest advertising campaign to encourage young  Kiwis to help our farmers, Senator Keneally instead decided to launch a shameless attack  on our hard working and law abiding farmers:

“People are exploited. Shocking stories of sexual exploitation, physical abuse,  withholding passports.”

“I think many Australian parents would be horrified to learn that the fruit they put in  their kids lunch box has been picked often by a 19-year-old backpacker who is  sexually exploited and having her wages stolen.”

Senator Keneally, 10 December 2020.

Every day Labor proves just how out of touch they are to Australian farmers and its time  they thank them for the service they have provided all Australians in 2020 and apologise  unequivocally.
