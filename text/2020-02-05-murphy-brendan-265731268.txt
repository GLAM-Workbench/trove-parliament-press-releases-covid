Australian confirmed cases of novel coronavirus on cruise vessel

Thirteen cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been confirmed in Australia - the  latest being an eight-year-old boy from Wuhan in China.

Importantly, of the 13 patients, three have recovered from the virus, and the others are  understood to be in a stable condition.

A further two Australians on board a cruise ship in Japan, the Diamond Princess, have also  been confirmed to have contracted novel coronavirus. They are among 223 Australian  passengers and three Australian crew on board.

The ship has been quarantined by Japanese authorities in Yokohama.

In other developments, 241 Australians have been transferred from Wuhan to Christmas  Island, where they will remain in quarantine for up to 14 days.

An additional 23 Australians and 12 permanent residents have been evacuated out of Wuhan  on a New Zealand assisted departure flight. They will be transferred to Christmas Island  where they will spend up to 14 days in quarantine.

Minister Hunt said, “The Australian Government is exploring options for other Australians  wishing to leave China.”

“We are in close contact with Chinese authorities and Australians seeking help to depart  China about a possible second assisted departure flight from Wuhan to Australia.”

Australian Government Chief Medical Officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, said authorities  remained confident the coronavirus would be contained in Australia.

“We are reviewing all aspects of the epidemiology on a daily basis but the 13 confirmed  cases in Australia appear to have all been successfully contained,” Professor Murphy said.
