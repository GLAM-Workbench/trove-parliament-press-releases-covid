GOVERNMENT SHOULD SUPPORT OUR LOCAL CRAFT DISTILLERS  CRAZY TAX REGIME NEEDS TO BE FIXED



Independent Member for Clark, Andrew Wilkie, will call on the Federal Government to  support local craft and boutique distillers by ending taxation disparities.

WHEN: Approximately 6.15pm TODAY 22 March 2021  WHERE: House of Representatives Federation Chamber (watch live at  https://www.aph.gov.au/news_and_events/watch_parliament)

“The Tasmanian craft spirits industry is taking the world by storm, as producers continue to  win awards on the international stage for their world-class boutique whiskey, gin and vodka,”  Mr Wilkie said. “But the ability of this burgeoning industry to recover from the COVID-19  pandemic is being hamstrung and hopes of expanding overseas are being dashed.

“Craft distillers are paying far more tax than beer, cider, wine or even brandy producers. And  because tax increases are linked to CPI and reset every six months, actual prices are actually  rising faster than inflation because the tax increases are on top of the inflation.

“The boutique distillery industry is crying out for support and I’m calling on the Federal  Government to cut the spirits excise rate to the brandy rate and freeze spirits and brandy CPI  indexation for three years to give these producers a chance to get back on their feet after the  COVID-19 economic downtown.

“Moreover increasing the current excise refund scheme limit from $100,000 to $350,000,  which brings it into line with the rebate offered to small wine producers under the Wine  Equalisation Tax, would provide much needed relief to local craft distillers across the country.”
