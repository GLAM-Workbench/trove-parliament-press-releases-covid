Landcare Week 2020: Celebrating sustainability in  agriculture

Ã¯ÂÂ· August 3 - 9 is Landcare Week 2020  Ã¯ÂÂ· The National Landcare program is a $1 billion Coalition Government  commitment to natural resource management  Ã¯ÂÂ· Improving the resilience and productive capacity of our soils, water and

vegetation helps underpin successful primary industries and regional  communities

Landcare’s role in the Australian community has never been more important, with our  worldwide clean green reputation placing agriculture at the heart of our COVID-19  recovery.

Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management David Littleproud said the  Landcare movement unites farming communities across all commodities and regions in  conserving, protecting, and maintaining healthy lands and waters.

“This year we’re encouraging more communities to get involved in the care and  management of their local environment.

“Landcare Week is also an opportunity to remind ourselves that we farm more sustainably,  efficiently and ethically than just about any country on earth.

“This week is also a chance to acknowledge and celebrate the thousands of people who  get involved with Landcare every year and work hard to make our country a better place,”  Minister Littleproud said.

“As a result of programs such as Landcare, Australia’s clean green image is paying off,  helping us send our high-quality, safe and premium food all over the planet.

“Our $1 billion investment in phase two of Landcare continues the Coalition Government’s  long-term commitment to natural resource management.

“I thank Landcare Australia, the National Landcare Network, local Landcare groups, NRM  regional bodies and farming groups for their commitment, dedication and hard work to  make Landcare the success that it is - we simply couldn’t do this without you.” Minister  Littleproud said today.
