Supporting Australian business to fill critical skills needs



A new priority skills list and strengthened labour market testing will allow small numbers of  sponsored skilled workers to return to Australia to fill urgent skills needs in critical sectors,  helping to create Australian jobs and rebuild Australia’s economy.

The 17 occupations on the Priority Migration Skilled Occupation List (PMSOL) were based on  advice from the National Skills Commission and consultation with relevant Commonwealth  agencies and will be reviewed regularly.

Acting Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs Alan  Tudge said the changes would strike the right balance for Australia’s economic recovery.

“Our priority is getting Australians back into work but we also need key health workers to help  fight the virus and skilled migrants who are going to be job multipliers, to help the economy  recover,” Mr Tudge said.

“These occupations in the health care, construction and IT sectors will supercharge both our  health and economic response to COVID-19.

“Visa holders, who have been sponsored by an Australia business in a PMSOL occupation can  request an exemption from Australia’s travel restrictions, but will be subject to a strict 14 days  quarantine on arrival at their own expense.”

Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator the Hon Michaelia Cash  said the PMSOL would be complemented by strengthened labour market testing requirements.

“In addition to the current requirements of two national advertisements, employers must also  advertise their vacancy on the Government’s jobactive wesbite,” Minister Cash said.

“JobKeeper is keeping many Australians in work and our $1 billion JobTrainer fund will create  340,700 new training places, but some sectors still need more skilled workers now.

“The occupations were chosen after careful analysis of recent changes to the internet vacancy  index, changes in employment, and longer-term stability in the labour market for individual  occupations.”

“As COVID-19 continues to play out both at home and abroad, we will closely monitor labour  market trends and respond to any changes in our skills needs.”

Existing skilled migration occupation lists will remain active and visas will still be processed, but  priority will be given to those in occupations on the PMSOL.

The 17 occupations (ANZSCO code) are:   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Chief Executive or Managing Director (111111)  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Construction Project Manager (133111)  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Mechanical Engineer (233512)  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ General Practitioner (253111)  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Resident Medical Officer (253112)  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Psychiatrist (253411)  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Medical Practitioner nec (253999)  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Midwife (254111)  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Registered Nurse (Aged Care) (254412)  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Registered Nurse (Critical Care and Emergency) (254415)  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Registered Nurse (Medical) (254418)
