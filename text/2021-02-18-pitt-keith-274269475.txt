NEW STRATEGY TO DRIVE AUSTRALIAN JOBS IN RESOURCES SECTOR

The Australian Government has released a new strategy to help Australians take up  jobs in resources industries and to make sure Australia has the skilled workers  needed to meet future demand.

The resources sector represents half of Australia’s exports and directly employs over  260,000 people in Australia, while supporting more than one million other jobs  across the economy.

Employment in the sector has grown by 8.5 per cent between last February and  November 2020, creating over 20,000 new jobs, and this growth trajectory is  expected to continue.

Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia Keith Pitt said Australia’s  National Resources Workforce Strategy demonstrates the support and opportunities  for careers in a thriving sector.

“There are opportunities across both cities and regions, with employees working in  hi-vis, lab coats and office spaces. This Strategy supports Australians to get the skills  needed to take up these jobs,” Minister Pitt said.

“The resources sector has been a standout through the global COVID pandemic.

“It’s continued to grow despite the pandemic and border disruptions at a time when  it is more important than ever that Australians have access to jobs and opportunities.

“We particularly want to ensure that people living in regional communities have  opportunities to study, train and upskill to take up these jobs,” Minister Pitt said.

Minister Pitt said Australia’s National Resources Workforce Strategy complements  the Government’s JobMaker plan and brings together education and training  initiatives to support participation and future growth.

The Strategy outlines measures in the three key areas of opportunity, participation  and quality, including ways the Government is:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Working with industry to plan for job creation and skills demand;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Supporting local employment, particularly in regional communities;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Providing opportunities, particularly for women and Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander peoples to engage with resources careers; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Increasing the availability of resources-related training.

Minister Pitt said the Government has provided $30 million to establish a new School  of Mining and Manufacturing at the Central Queensland University, and invested  $585.3 million in vocational education and training through the Delivering Skills for  Today and Tomorrow package, including a Mining Skills Organisation Pilot.

“The sector relies on certain skills to unlock new resources potential and productivity  and to maintain our status as a world-leading supplier of resources and energy,”  Minister Pitt said.

“This new Strategy aims to help the sector meet its need for skills, and to promote  resources job opportunities and training to Australian workers.”
