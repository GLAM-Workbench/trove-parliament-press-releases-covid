Ministerial Statement on Rural and Regional Budget Outcomes

8 October 2020

[Introductory words according to statement conventions]

Mr Speaker,

Our Government has stood with regional Australia through its most difficult  times. We will stand with them as we face the COVID recession.

Australia’s regions have always supported the growth of our nation.

This address reflects the Morrison-McCormack Government’s view that a  thriving regional Australia is at the heart of the strong economy we are  building.

The Budget the Treasurer handed down on Tuesday invests heavily in regional  Australia.

We are optimistic about Regional Australia. We have every reason to be.

Our regions are resilient. Country people are strong. The regions have a great  future.

Today, in this first annual Regional Ministerial Statement on Regional Australia,  I will outline the Government’s plans to grow our regions.

These are plans which will create jobs, generate exports and ensure regional  Australia continues to be the best place in which to live, work and raise a  family - where people continue to experience what it means to be part of a  connected and caring community.

2



These are plans which invest in infrastructure, water and services - ensuring  regional Australians have as much opportunity as other Australians.

The Government’s plans will help make our regions stronger.

I am very proud of our regions - and what they contribute to our country.

Minerals exports are holding firm in the face of COVID’s impact on economies  world-wide.

Likewise, our farm industries are underpinning Australia’s economy and will  continue to do so.

It’s not just economic strength - more Australians are seeing regional Australia  with new eyes, with tree-changers and sea changers looking afresh at our  regions.

The growing attraction of people seeing a quality of life second to none - a life  with less traffic, a home with big backyards, with reliable, well-paying jobs and  affordable living.

This is Regional Australia.

It’s why my colleagues and I are so passionate about the towns and regions  from which we come.

… And it’s what we seek to build and protect.

Mr Speaker, this Budget recognises a sustainable recovery depends on regional  Australia, already home to one in three Australians.

From minerals exports to regional manufacturing to highly-sought clean, green  Aussie farm produce - we have industries in demand and industries that can  and will grow.

Mr Speaker,

Through previous years, our focus has been on responding to a severe and  prolonged drought and indeed to flooding in North Queensland.

3



Our response to drought has been comprehensive, committing to initiatives  worth more than $10 billion since 2018-19.

Just as we are doing with the pandemic, we have invested in practical actions  helping farmers, regional businesses and communities through drought now  and building resilience for the future.

… And some aren’t on the other side yet, which is why the Government  extended the Farm Household Allowance in June, making it simpler and easier  to access and support some 12,000 farm families.

Our $5 billion Future Drought Fund is about preparing for the future. The first  suite of programs under this Fund have already been announced.

Large areas of northern Queensland have suffered terrible drought and  devastating flood.

Through the Drought and Flood Agency, ably led by Shane Stone, the  Government has worked closely with affected communities to support  response and recovery activities.

Hard on the heels of extreme drought conditions, we responded swiftly to the  Black Summer of bushfires - including by establishing the National Bushfire  Recovery Agency which is delivering $2 billion worth of support measures for  primary producers, small businesses and communities.

I pay tribute to the efforts of Andrew Colvin and his team. They are providing  recovery grants, concessional loans and supporting industries across  agriculture and forestry.

Money in the pocket to ensure food on the table.

This is making a real difference where it counts - on the ground.

Drought and fires may have subsided but we now face the challenges of  COVID-19.

Our response has been about saving lives and livelihoods.

Healthcare is a major concern for regional Australians.

4



We have allocated more funding to the states and territories to ensure the  availability of services in small rural and regional hospitals.

We have established 82 General Practitioner-led Respiratory Clinics in rural  and remote areas to provide testing and assessments.

The swift expansion of Telehealth is providing new options for regional  patients with more than eight million services provided, and we’ve boosted  testing in rural and remote Indigenous communities.

The Budget invests a further $50.3 million through the Rural Health  Multidisciplinary Training program for infrastructure to deliver new training  across health disciplines from nursing to allied health, underpinning services to  aged care, disability, rehabilitation, childcare and Indigenous health.

This will guarantee rural and regional communities will continue to benefit  from a skilled health workforce and have improved access to health services  and facilities, including essential mental health and suicide prevention  measures, long after the pandemic has passed.

Our economic response to the pandemic has also been strong.

Walk any street in any town in our country and people will tell you how vital  JobKeeper has been and the jobs it has saved. They are certainly telling me.

JobKeeper is a $101 billion lifeline supporting around 3.5 million workers in  more than 900,000 businesses - right across Australia.

… And we’ve backed small businesses with $32 billion in cashflow boosts to  around 800,000 businesses.

Many of these businesses faced and beat drought - and the Prime Minister  and I are determined they overcome the challenges of COVID.

The actions of the 2020-21 Budget build on this support with targeted  assistance for where the regions need it the most.

Businesses small and large have taken advantage of the historic Instant Asset  Write-Off provisions boosted in the face of COVID. Now, from Tuesday -

5



Budget night 2020 - the Government has delivered the largest set of  investment incentives ever provided by any Australian Government.

Now, more than 99 per cent of businesses can write off the full value of any  eligible asset they purchase for their business. This will be available to  businesses with a turnover up to $5 billion, until June 2022.

This will mean a family-owned trucking company can upgrade or buy a whole  new fleet of trucks and write it off in the year of investment.

From the outset of the COVID-19 crisis and as a result of the restrictions we  had to put in place to protect our population, we saw the immediate need for  targeted assistance for our regions.

This is why we quickly established the $1 billion COVID-19 Relief and Recovery  Fund to provide timely support when and where it was most critically needed.

Through this fund, we have provided significant assistance to a wide range of  industries.

This year, we’ve also supported our primary industries through this fund - we  committed funding for fisheries, the seafood sector, and agricultural shows  and field days, so often run by dedicated volunteers - these events being the  fabric of the country communities they’ve served in many cases since the late  1800s.

Look at the range of actions underway:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ from air freight support to levy relief for fisheries;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ from a boost to export marketing to crisis relief for the arts;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ from backing in our zoos and aquariums to financial counselling for small  regional businesses.

Each are practical actions; each making a real difference.

Aviation was one of the industries hit early, and hit hard, by COVID-19 and  those impacts are still being felt today.

6



Domestic aviation is vital to the health of regional communities.

Extensions to Domestic Aviation Network Support, or “DANS”, and the  Regional Airline Network Support, or “RANS”, have already backed in the  operation of more than 6,700 return services to more than 120 locations  across Australia.

Broken Hill, Ceduna, Cunnamulla, Mount Isa, Bathurst, Narrandera and  Kangaroo Island are among dozens of continuing flight destinations, all thanks  to “RANS” and “DANS” support.

Some rural and remote communities would have had no access to essential air  services without this support. This includes the carriage of face-masks,  personal protective, respiratory equipment and essential healthcare workers.

The $352 million International Freight Assistance Mechanism (IFAM) has  already helped get more than 90,000 tonnes of Australian produce to key  export markets.

By 23 September this action, “IFAM”, has committed more than 142,000  tonnes to an export value of $1.87 billion. It is moving freight from nine  Australian ports to 66 international locations.

The IFAM is flying Tasmanian salmon, West Australian crays and Victorian lamb  out to destinations in Asia and the Middle East.

We are grateful for recent rains, but ensuring the security, supply and quality  of our water is absolutely central to the future of regional Australia and central  to new economic growth for all Australians.

To build on regional Australia’s potential - I say: just add water!

The Australian Government has broken new ground in establishing the  National Water Grid Authority.

The Authority is now advised by an expert eight-member National Water Grid  Advisory Body of eminent Australians, headed by global senior executive Chris  Lynch, providing independent, expert advice on water infrastructure policies,

7



projects and investments to benefit agricultural and primary industries  Australia-wide.

Now we’re more than doubling the investment.

A further $2 billion now takes the National Water Infrastructure Development  Fund to a total of $3.5 billion. The Fund will become a 10-year rolling program  of priority water infrastructure investments.

We’ve announced a doubling of our capital commitment to Wyangala and  Dungowan dams in New South Wales - taking the Commonwealth’s  investment in those dams to $567 million and matched by the State  Government.

Adding capacity to these dams will deliver more than 650 gigalitres of water -  or 1.2 Sydney Harbours’ worth.

Increasing storage means big things for communities - for the Dungowan Dam,  it means a reliable supply of water for beef, sheep, grain, lucerne and poultry  producers. It means flood mitigation. It means long-term water security for the  people of Tamworth.

The Australian Government will continue to work, as we must, with the States  to deliver Australia’s water infrastructure of the 21st Century.

Mr Speaker, the key to vibrant communities, reducing the costs of getting  produce to markets, and creating stronger job-creating industries in our  regions is infrastructure.

The Government is further accelerating its already record-setting work to  deliver the right infrastructure in the right places, right now.

A record $100 billion 10-year plan now becomes $110 billion from this Budget,  delivering a vast range of new projects. Of this, around $36 billion directly  builds regional infrastructure.

Australian Government-funded projects under construction are expected to  support more than 100,000 direct and indirect jobs across Australia over the  life of the projects.

8



This is a jobs and infrastructure and regional budget.

The 2020-21 Budget has commitments for numerous land transport and road  initiatives to make a difference to regional communities all over Australia,  including:

Ã¢ÂÂ $560 million to build the New England Highway’s Singleton Bypass  Ã¢ÂÂ $528 million for regional rail services for the people of Shepparton and  Warrnambool, and  Ã¢ÂÂ $120 million for the Carpentaria Highway Upgrade in the Northern

Territory.

There will be extra work to upgrade and plan Queensland’s Bruce Highway on  top of our existing commitment of $10 billion.

The Roads of Strategic Importance initiative, “ROSI”, continues its work in  ensuring our key freight roads are efficiently connected, while our Roads to  Recovery Program supports the construction and maintenance of local roads  to improve safety and accessibility.

We’ve also announced an additional $1 billion to our Local Roads and  Community Infrastructure Program, taking the total commitment to $1.5  billion going directly to local councils - this will stimulate regional economies  and support community infrastructure projects.

Of course, one of our biggest infrastructure projects is Inland Rail, which is  delivering jobs and investment in regional Australia when we need it most.

This Melbourne to Brisbane 1,700 kilometre corridor of commerce - using  Australian steel - will become the new artery for trade, trade and commerce  along our Eastern Seaboard.

Mr Speaker, I was pleased to announce as part of this Budget a commitment of  $200 million to Round Five of our Building Better Regions Fund.

BBRF delivers regional development.

This is not a one-size-fits all approach. It’s everything from water recycling  facilities to refreshed streetscapes.

9



BBRF Round Four alone has delivered 163 projects across Australia.

These projects make a huge difference for the regions and there’s so much  more opportunity directly ahead.

In Round Five of BBRF we will include a specific stream for tourism-related  infrastructure, worth $100 million. This recognises tourism has been hit hard  during COVID-19.

This Round will complement other actions the Government has taken to  support regional tourism through the Relief and Recovery Fund as well as the  $50 million Regional Tourism Recovery initiative.

This summer Australians will use their holidays to see their own country - it's  better than anywhere else in the world.

Our efforts to improve communications have opened regional communities  and businesses like never before.

We are investing in significant upgrades and improvements to communications  with a new $37.1 million package for Strengthening Telecommunications  Against Natural Disasters and an additional $30.3 million for the Regional  Connectivity Program.

We’re fixing mobile phone black spots with more than 850 base stations  already activated, and we’re investing $4.5 billion in new upgrades to the  National Broadband Network.

In a significant investment in Australia’s small and medium businesses, NBN  will be rolling out 240 Business Fibre Zones across Australia, 85 of which will be  located in regional Australia.

This initiative will deliver accessible, affordable, ultra-fast connectivity to  Australian businesses at no upfront cost, creating thousands of jobs in regional  Australia and allowing more than 250,000 regional businesses to boost their  digital capabilities and support our economic recovery from COVID-19.

The Government is making changes to the Northern Australia Infrastructure  Facility to make it an even more effective vehicle to encourage investment in  the North.

10



These changes will provide more flexibility, increase the risk appetite and  widen the scope of projects eligible for funding for this vibrant, happening  place.

Along with the five-year extension to NAIF operations, these changes will help  ensure northern Australia plays a strong role in Australia’s economic recovery.

Mr Speaker, if COVID-19 has proven anything - it is that you can work remotely  and anywhere.

We know increasing numbers of Australians are choosing to decentralise, to  regionalise.

We want more businesses and public service agencies to take full advantage of  the opportunities we now have by encouraging their employees to work from  a regional or remote area.

I invite arms of industry to actively consider moving their entire operations out  of the city. You will not regret it!

This has long been the thinking behind our Decentralisation Agenda, which  can also be considered a regionalisation agenda.

New Research and Development Program initiatives aim to encourage private  sector investment in regional Australia.

The Budget provides $100 million to Regional Recovery Partnerships.

These Partnerships are about co-ordinating investments with other levels of  government, to support recovery and growth in 10 regions.

We’re backing in existing regional plans and we’re developing a package of  targeted initiatives to deliver jobs, economic recovery and economic  diversification.

And, more broadly, National Cabinet has supported the establishment of a  dedicated Rural and Regional Reform Committee.

11



On our first agenda will be outcomes - real-world actions, not documents or  studies, to ensure our significant investments reach the people who need  them… and fast!

Mr Speaker, our primary industries, including agriculture, have been hit hard  in recent years by the impacts of floods, drought, bushfires and now COVID-19  restrictions.

The Government is committed to supporting our primary industries.

Agriculture is capable of great adaptation and innovation - which is why we  are working to support the farm sector’s goal to become a $100 billion industry  by 2030.

We grow food enough to feed 75 million people - three times our nation’s  population.

We export 70 per cent of what we raise and grow in Australia. This is why the  Government continues to focus on establishing export agreements with  trading partners.

In 2013, trade agreements and preferential access accounted for 26 per cent of  what we export. Today this figure is 70 per cent - and still growing.

It’s ground-breaking news for producers, for exporters and for our regions. We  are permanently lifting the contribution by our regions to the national  economic recovery.

Trade equals jobs and more trade, equals more jobs.

Beyond our commitments to water security and drought resilience which will  contribute to this ambitious goal, we’ve also announced a number of new  measures in this year’s Budget including a significant $328.4 million package to  support agricultural exporters.

This will generate wider benefits for industry of up to $1.2 billion over the next  decade, with rural and regional Australia reaping the largest benefits.

12



We’ve also announced a Murray-Darling Basin Communities Investment  Package - worth $269.6 million over four years, and $9.8 million per year after  that.

This package will achieve a sustainable and certain future for the Murray-Darling Basin, its people, industries and an ever-changing environment. It will  bring Basin communities back to the centre of the Basin Plan and invest in  community resilience and river health.

Our plan for affordable, reliable energy will see us lock in low electricity and  gas prices to take pressure off Australian households and businesses. Nowhere  is this more important than for our regions.

Coal has helped power our nation for generations and boost exports and will  go on doing so.

Bringing on dispatchable generation capacity will help keep our electricity grid  reliable and secure. Opening up new gas fields and reforming gas transport  markets will help ensure abundant and affordable gas for manufacturing and  power generation.

We’ve provided funding for the forestry industry through the National Bushfire  Recovery Fund and for primary producers through a range of measures.

And we are providing additional funding to support people to relocate in order  to take up agricultural work, which will be absolutely vital for our agricultural  communities as they start to recover from COVID-19 impacts.

We are also supporting our manufacturing industries with $1.5 billion in new  funding in the Budget for our Modern Manufacturing Strategy.

This will grow our manufacturing base in areas such as resources, technology  and critical minerals processing, food and beverage manufacturing and  defence industry - opening up new opportunities for regional Australia.

Mr Speaker, this jobs and infrastructure and regional Budget includes a  commitment of $62.8 million for the Local Jobs Program in 25 regions across  Australia.

13



The program focuses on reskilling, upskilling and providing employment  pathways to help people back into the workforce as the economy recovers.

As well as jobs, we know that regional Australians want the same quality  educational opportunities as anyone else.

In this Budget we’ve also announced the Student Support package worth  $146.3 million which will improve education outcomes for young Australians,  particularly disadvantaged students and regional students.

This complements our broader higher education reforms and commitments,  including $400 million over four years to increase higher education access and  attainment for regional Australians, and support higher education providers in  regional Australia to grow their local economies.

We want to develop more local leaders in our communities and our Budget  includes support to do just that.

Mr Speaker, I’m a proud barracker for the bush.

I’ve lived my life in the regions. Worked in and raised a family in the Riverina.

First and last, our regions are about people.

People want to be connected - through safe, accessible transport options, and  broadband and mobile technology.

People want their industries and businesses to be valued, viable, and  supported.

People want their regions to be friendly, liveable and welcoming places for  hard working people of any background.

People want opportunities for training, education, and employment - for  themselves, for their employees, and their children.

Whether you are a veteran or serving member of our defence forces, a police  officer, a nurse, a manufacturer, a tradesperson or whichever vocation you  choose - regional Australia has something to offer.

14



Our people want sustainable natural resources to support economic  development and jobs.

I say of our regions and towns - they are big enough for a great cup of coffee,  small enough to care.

Our Budget announcements - across infrastructure and transport, digital  connectivity, water security, regional partnerships with states, and supporting  local jobs and local leaders - are designed to make every part of our country  better.

Regional Australia must have - Regional Australia will have - the support it  needs to recover and grow from this pandemic.

Our regions have the drive, let’s make them thrive.

That’s our message today.
