SCOTT MORRISON’S AGED CARE TRAGEDY



A report released in London overnight shows 75 per cent of all COVID deaths in Australia have

been among aged care residents.



On this measure, Australia has the worst performance in the world.







The Morrison Government is responsible for funding and regulating aged care in Australia.



Tragically, 685 older Australians died in aged care homes from COVID-19 because the

Morrison Government didn’t have a plan.



Scott Morrison has never accepted the responsibility for the tragedy that unfolded in Australia’s

aged care system. He has never apologised to the families who lost loved ones.



And in December, Scott Morrison re-appointed Richard Colbeck to the aged care portfolio, the

Minister who oversaw these tragic deaths.
