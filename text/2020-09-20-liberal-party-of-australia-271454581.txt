FURTHER INVESTMENT IN THREE NEW AUSTRALIAN   COVID-19 VACCINE RESEARCH PROJECTS

The Morrison Government will invest almost $6 million in additional funding from the  Medical Research Future Fund’s (MRFF) Coronavirus Research Response to support research  and development of three Australian COVID-19 vaccines.

The rapid development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines is a critical Australian  Government priority.

Under the competitive, peer reviewed COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate Research Grant  Opportunity, funding will be allocated for the further development of three COVID-19  vaccines.

The University of Melbourne will receive almost $3 million to develop two vaccine  candidates. Both vaccines are targeting the tip of the spike protein, known as the receptor  binding domain, but use different vaccine techniques to compare which vaccine maximises  the production of neutralising antibodies.

Ã¯ÂÂ· protein vaccine - this vaccine introduces a protein into the body to maximise the  antibody immune response to neutralise viral infectivity  Ã¯ÂÂ· mRNA vaccine - this vaccine represents a genetic sequence that supports the human  body to make the protein which would then maximise the antibody response to the tip

of the spike protein to neutralise viral infectivity

The University of Sydney, will receive almost $3 million for a Phase 1/1b clinical trial to test  the safety and effectiveness of a novel DNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine is being  developed so it can be administered using a needle-free system. The trial is a partnership with  four of Australia’s most experienced vaccine trial sites and aims to enrol 150 healthy  volunteers. Findings from the trial will inform evaluation of the vaccine in larger Phase two  and three trials.

Subject to further work, the resulting vaccines could eventually be deployed in Australia and  around the world.

These investments build on existing MRFF support for COVID-19 vaccines, including  $5 million provided to the University of Queensland for their innovative ‘molecular clamp’  technology and $1 million to Vaxine for their COVAX-19Â® vaccine.

Our Government continues to invest in medical research to supercharge the development of  promising vaccines to save lives and protect lives.

The Government has invested more than $2 billion in COVID-19 research and development.

This includes $1.7 billion to secure early access to over 84.8 million COVID-19 vaccine  doses and $362 million for diagnostics, vaccine development, antiviral development, clinical  trials, digital health research infrastructure and research into the human immune response to  COVID-19 infection.

Research plays a critical role in ensuring Australia maintains its world-class health system  and is particularly important as the world responds to COVID-19.
