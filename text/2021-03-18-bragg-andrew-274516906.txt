Australia as a Technology and Finance Hub  18.03.2021

Senator Andrew Bragg: Statement on the Senate Select  Committee on Financial Technology

and Regulatory Technology

Today the Senate voted to expand the scope and length  of the FinTech Select Committee to

further improve Australia’s position as a global financial  and technology hub.

Committee Chairman, Senator Bragg sought to extend  the Committee beyond its April deadline

to October 2021, and has changed the name to the ‘Select  Committee on Australia as a

Technology and Financial Centre’.

“The work of the Committee so far has clearly shown  Australia is well poised for rapid growth in

the sector to attract investment and create jobs,”  Senator Bragg said.

“This is the ideal time to widen our scope and explore  new opportunities for Australia as a

technology and finance centre arising from the COVID-19  pandemic.”

Senator Bragg said it is critical to use this opportunity  to consider opportunities in:

-

Cryptocurrency and digital assets  -

Neobanking  -

Instances of corporate law holding back investment  -

Options to replace the Offshore Banking Unit as set  out in a recent statement from the

Treasurer - https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/media-releases/amendi  ng-australias-offshore-banking-unit-regime-0

Senator Bragg noted that technology has unlocked geographic  restraints on Australia to

become a hub for global technology.

“I fully expect the Committee to focus on removing  more barriers to Australian growth as a

technology and finance centre,” he said.

“This is a golden opportunity to bolster Australia’s  economic growth and I want to ensure we

take full advantage of it”, Senator Bragg said.

The Committee is expected to deliver a report in April on its existing work programme and a  further report on the new mandate in October.
