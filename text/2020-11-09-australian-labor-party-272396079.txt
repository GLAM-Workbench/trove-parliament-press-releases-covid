CHIEF SCIENTIST APPOINTMENT



Federal Labor welcomes the appointment of renowned physicist Dr Cathy Foley AO PSM

FAA FTSE as Australia’s next Chief Scientist.



Dr Foley’s contribution to the Australian scientific community and reputation as a mentor,

particularly for young women makes her an excellent choice to see our nation through a

critical phase in our history.



The role of high quality science has never been more important following the most recent

devastating bushfires and our nation’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is science

that will be vital in our recovery from these events. Dr Foley has noted the importance of

science to ensure sovereign capability by having a strong onshore manufacturing sector

and federal Labor couldn’t agree more.



We also thank the outgoing Chief Scientist, Dr Alan Finkel AO FAA FTSE for his

outstanding contribution to our nation, not just during his time as Chief Scientist, but

throughout his career.



Dr Finkel’s dedication to science was obvious to all in Federal Labor who had the pleasure

of working with him.



He has a worthy successor in Dr Foley and we look forward to working with her in her new

role.
