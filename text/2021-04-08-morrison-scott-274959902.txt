ASTRAZENECA COVID-19 VACCINE



Earlier this evening the Australian Government received advice from the vaccine expert taskforce,  the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).

The detail of that advice is attached.

The Government accepts the advice from Australia’s medical experts and will move swiftly to ensure  Australia’s vaccination program and advice to patients is adjusted accordingly.

The Australian Government places safety above all else, as it has done throughout the pandemic,  and will continue to follow the medical advice in protecting Australians.

The ATAGI advice is clear that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective in preventing  severe disease caused by COVID-19.

The medical advice to the Government is that the risk of blood clotting side effects from the Astra  Zeneca vaccine is four to six in one million people, in the first four to 20 days post the vaccine.  This  is a rare but serious side effect.

On that basis, the recommendation is that it is preferred that the Pfizer vaccine be provided to  adults under the age of 50.  The AstraZeneca vaccine should only be given as a first dose to adults  under the age of 50 where the benefit clearly outweighs the risk for that individual.

AstraZeneca is recommended for those over the age of 50.

The vaccination program will continue, particularly for the most vulnerable Australians in Phase 1B  including those over the age of 70 who are not impacted by this revised advice.

The longer term timeframe for the program is being reviewed following this medical advice.

The Department of Health will provide preliminary, updated advice to general practitioners and  health professionals.

The ATAGI advice follows further international evidence including from the vaccinations in Europe  and the United Kingdom.  ATAGI had already provided updated guidance on 2 April.



The ATAGI advice has today been considered by the Australian Health Protection Principal  Committee (AHPPC), which is the Medical Expert Panel led by the Chief Medical Officer, and also  comprising all State and Territory Chief Health Officers.

The advice will be provided to National Cabinet tomorrow.

The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) advice on the AstraZeneca  COVID-19 vaccine in response to new vaccine safety concerns  8 April 2021

Summary  Ã¯ÂÂ· ATAGI notes further evidence of a rare but serious side effect involving thrombosis (clotting)  with thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count) following receipt of COVID-19 Vaccine  AstraZeneca  Ã¯ÂÂ· ATAGI recommends that the COVID-19 vaccine by Pfizer (Comirnaty) is preferred over

COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca in adults aged under 50 years. This recommendation is based  on the increasing risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 in older adults (and hence a higher  benefit from vaccination) and a potentially increased risk of thrombosis with  thrombocytopenia following AstraZeneca vaccine in those under 50 years.   Ã¯ÂÂ· COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca can be used in adults aged under 50 years where the benefits

clearly outweigh the risk for that individual and the person has made an informed decision  based on an understanding of the risks and benefits.  Ã¯ÂÂ· People who have had the first dose of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca without any serious  adverse effects can be given the second dose, including adults under 50 years.



Background - Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome and COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca

ATAGI recommends that all adults are vaccinated against COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic is  continuing to cause severe disease around the world, with many lives being lost. The Australian  population remains vulnerable to COVID-19 and most Australians have not yet been vaccinated and  are not immune.

ATAGI advised on 25th March 2021 that there was a potential safety concern being investigated  overseas, involving cases of thrombosis (blood clots) and thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet  count) occurring after COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. On 2nd April 2021 ATAGI reported that a  probable case had been reported in an Australian vaccine recipient, and issued an updated advice  for healthcare providers.

This ‘thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome’ (TTS) is a newly described serious condition,  with unusual blood clots in the brain (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) or in other parts of the  body, associated with low platelet levels. Some researchers have provisionally called this condition  ‘vaccine induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia’ (VIPIT). However, the causal  relationship and exact mechanism leading to this condition is not yet understood. Some people have  antibodies which activate platelets (anti-PF4 antibodies). These antibodies have been detected in  another disorder triggered by the drug heparin, which has a similar presentation.

ATAGI and other Australian officials continue to consult with the WHO, UK, European and other  regulatory agencies in countries where use of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine has been  widespread. Further information from the UK and Europe is still emerging. The European Medicines  Agency (EMA) stated on 7 April 2021 that a causal relationship between the AstraZeneca vaccination  and thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia is plausible.

In the UK, where approximately 20.2 million doses of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine have been  administered, their regulatory agency, the MHRA have advised that the evidence of a link is stronger  but more work is still needed.

OFFICIAL

ATAGI is aware of more cases of TTS being reported from other countries, and has reviewed all  available data and research provided by AstraZeneca, as well as independent expert groups.

Some countries that are using the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine have made precautionary decisions  about pausing or limiting its use based on the potential risk of this serious adverse event. These  decisions are also informed by the local risk for COVID-19, how much of the population is already  immune from vaccination and in what age groups, and whether they have an alternative supply of  vaccines.

The risk-versus-benefit assessment for the use of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine will be different for  Australia compared to other countries, such as those with widespread transmission. This includes  countries in our region such as those currently experiencing very serious outbreaks of COVID-19,  such as Timor Leste, Papua New Guinea and others.

Key Considerations

The following information has been considered by ATAGI in relation to its new recommendations:

Local epidemiology  Ã¯ÂÂ· While Australia currently has very low or no community transmission of COVID-19, this could  change, particularly in the context of high global transmission rates, including of new  variants of the virus. The risk of serious disease and death in Australia remains, even as

borders controls and other measures continue.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Although Australia has had few deaths from COVID-19 in young adults until now, large  outbreaks in other countries have caused many thousands of deaths in young adults,

indicating that the risk for serious outcomes exists across the age spectrum.

Vaccine availability and uptake  Ã¯ÂÂ· The AstraZeneca vaccine is highly effective at reducing the risk of death or severe disease  from COVID-19 across all adult age groups. At the present time, the AstraZeneca vaccine is  the only vaccine option for reducing this risk for many Australians, since the global

availability of alternative vaccines is highly constrained.   Ã¯ÂÂ· ATAGI recognises this safety concern will likely impact on confidence in being vaccinated  with AstraZeneca vaccine in all age groups.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Until the Government can increase supply of COVID-19 vaccines other than AstraZeneca,

overall coverage under Australia’s COVID-19 vaccine program will likely be reduced. This will  likely impact the time frame to which the Australian population is protected against COVID-19.   Ã¯ÂÂ· In the short term, delays in vaccine uptake increase the vulnerability of the Australian  population to outbreaks of COVID-19 and the attendant risk of death and serious morbidity,  especially among older Australians.

Evidence regarding TTS  Ã¯ÂÂ· The AstraZeneca vaccine appears likely to be causally-linked with a risk of this newly  recognised thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome.   Ã¯ÂÂ· There is currently uncertainty in, and different reported rates of risk, for this adverse event.    Ã¯ÂÂ· Studies have suggested it may occur in approximately 4 - 6 people in every one million

people in the 4-20 days after the first dose of vaccine. However, higher rates have been  reported in Germany and some Scandinavian countries.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Some evidence suggests the risk of this condition occurring may be somewhat higher in  people of a younger age, however a small number of cases have been reported in people of  different ages (including older adults).

Ã¯ÂÂ· While there have been more reports of TTS in women in some settings, this may be because  more vaccine doses have been given to women. In one country the reported rate of TTS  (number of cases adjusted for the number of men and women vaccinated) was similar in  men and women.

Ã¯ÂÂ· TTS can cause serious long term disability or death (with death occurring in approximately  25% of reported cases).   Ã¯ÂÂ· So far no specific biological risk factors or pre-existing medical conditions have been found  to modify (i.e. increase or decrease) the risk of TTS occurring after AstraZeneca vaccine.    Ã¯ÂÂ· We do not yet know to what extent earlier recognition of this syndrome and improved

treatments will improve patient outcomes. More cases can be expected to occur, albeit  rarely.   Ã¯ÂÂ· Comirnaty (the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine) does not appear to carry a risk of TTS.

Benefit-to-risk assessment  Ã¯ÂÂ· ATAGI consider that the individual benefit-to-risk balance of vaccination with COVID-19  vaccine AstraZeneca in Australia varies with age. The risk of ongoing health issues and death  from COVID-19 is highest in older age groups, particularly rising from 50 years of age. By

comparison, the rate, and thus possibility of disability and death from TTS may be higher in  younger people. This age-specific benefit-to-risk balance is demonstrated in an analysis from  the UK.  Ã¯ÂÂ· Younger people with certain underlying medical conditions are also at increased risk of  severe outcomes from COVID-19, which affects their individual benefit-to-risk balance.   Ã¯ÂÂ· ATAGI respects a person’s choice to make an informed decision on whether to accept the  risk of COVID-19 vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine. ATAGI recognise that it is difficult  for people to assess their personal risk where there is uncertainty about the short and long  term risk of severe COVID-19 in different age groups, and the evidence around benefit and  risk of the AstraZeneca vaccine is changing quickly.  Ã¯ÂÂ· In the context of the ongoing risk of COVID-19 in Australia, ATAGI considers that the benefit-to-risk balance is favourable for use of AstraZeneca vaccine in all older adult age groups.   Ã¯ÂÂ· ATAGI also consider that population coverage under Australia’s COVID-19 vaccine program  will likely be impacted until such time that an increased supply of alternative safe and  effective vaccines can be secured.

Recommendations

ATAGI recommends that:  1. At the current time, use of Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer) is preferred over  AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in adults aged < 50 years who have not already received a  first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine. This is based both on the increased risk of complications

from COVID-19 with increasing age (and thus increased benefit of vaccination), and the  potentially lower, but not zero, risk of TTS with increasing age.  2. Immunisation providers should only give a first dose of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to  adults aged < 50 years of age where benefit clearly outweighs risk for that individual’s

circumstances.   3. People who have had their first dose of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca without any serious  adverse effects can be given their second dose. This includes adults under 50 years of age.

People who have had blood clots associated with low platelet levels after their first dose of  COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca should not be given their second dose.

OFFICIAL

4. That the Department of Health further develop and refine resources for informed  consent that clearly convey the benefits and risks of AstraZeneca vaccine for both  immunisation providers and consumers of all ages.

This advice may be revised as more information becomes available or if the epidemiological situation  changes, particularly if there is, or is likely to be significant community transmission.

ATAGI supports the Australian Government's ongoing efforts to procure more or bring forward the  delivery of alternate COVID-19 vaccine brands to replace the use of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine  that would have been administered to persons under 50 years of age. Where possible, onshore  manufacturing of alternative safe and effective vaccines should be considered.

ATAGI intends to review other current COVID-19 vaccine recommendations as soon as practicable.  This includes recommendations on vaccination for those who have a past history of heparin induced  thrombocytopenia (HIT), central venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), and/or have other thrombosis risk  factors, and those who are pregnant.

Further data and outcomes of investigations from the UK, Europe and other countries will continue  to be reviewed over the coming days to weeks. ATAGI recommendations may change as a result of  this ongoing assessment of new and emerging evidence over coming days and weeks.



Definitions

Ã¯ÂÂ· Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) is a rare and new syndrome which has  been reported after being given the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. It may be caused by this  vaccine. The condition involves blood clots (occurring in body sites like the brain or  abdomen) together with low platelet levels.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot, which prevents blood flowing normally through  the body.

Ã¯ÂÂ· Thrombocytopenia is a condition in which you have a low blood platelet count. Platelets  (thrombocytes) are blood cells that help blood clot. Platelets stop bleeding by clumping and  forming plugs in blood vessel injuries.
