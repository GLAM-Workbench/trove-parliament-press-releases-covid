NEW ENTERPRISE INCENTIVE SCHEME PARTICIPANTS ABLE TO  ACCESS CORONAVIRUS SUPPLEMENT

The Government has announced the Coronavirus Supplement as part of its economic plan to  support Australian households and businesses.

The Coronavirus Supplement is available to existing and new recipients of eligible income  support payments from 27 April 2020. Further information about eligibility for the  Supplement can be found on the Services Australia website.

New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) participants can now choose to access the  Coronavirus Supplement if they are in receipt of an eligible income support payment. This  option will be available to both existing and new NEIS participants.

NEIS supports people to create their own job by starting a small business. In particular, NEIS  assists people to develop a range of new business skills and maximise new opportunities in  areas that have demand for goods and services during these changing economic times.

NEIS providers are assisting their participants throughout these difficult times and will work  with each NEIS participant to determine the best arrangements for their business in relation to  accessing the Coronavirus Supplement.

For more information on how to apply NEIS participants should contact their provider or visit  here.
