GREG HUNT ADDS MORE FUEL TO VACCINE ROLLOUT CHAOS

GPs around the country have been inundated with chaos because of the Morrison  Government’s complete blundering of the online booking system for COVID-19 vaccines.

It didn’t have to be this way - we knew the vaccine rollout was coming, the online booking  system should have been tested and finalised weeks ago. Instead all older Australians and  GPs have experienced is chaos and confusion.

Today Minister Hunt has fuelled even more confusion by telling ABC AM“Today we’re  announcing over 100 Commonwealth vaccination clinics that will take all-comers, with  over 100 around the country, that’s a very important addition and on average we’ll have  close to 1,000 vaccines a week, so that expands the capacity very significantly.”

These are not additional, in fact they were included in the Government’s COVID-19 vaccine  rollout presentation on Sunday the 14th of March and these GP respiratory clinics have  been operating since March 2020.

It’s time the Government stopped the spin and empty announcements and instead just got on  with the job of being honest with Australians about the vaccine rollout.

More than 400 million vaccines have been delivered around the world, more than 113 million  vaccines have been delivered in the US, and over 26 million in the UK. Australia is  sitting at around 200,000 vaccines delivered. The opening up of our economy is dependent on  vaccines being rolled out.

Australia has got to do better, we’ve got to start scaling this up quickly.
