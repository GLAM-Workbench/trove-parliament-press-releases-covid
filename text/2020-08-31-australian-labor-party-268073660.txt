MORRISON GOVERNMENT’S AGED CARE FAILINGS LAID BARE



The Morrison Government’s tragic failure to prepare Australia’s aged care system for COVID-19 outbreaks has been laid bare in an embarrassing press conference this afternoon.



The Minister for Aged Care, Richard Colbeck, when he was allowed the chance to speak by

the Minister for Health, was forced to admit key failings in the Morrison Government’s

response to COVID-19.



He confirmed the Federal Government has no idea about how many aged care employees are

working across multiple sites, despite the serious risks of this issue.



Alarming evidence emerged last week that new infections of COVID-19 in Victoria are being

driven by staff and residents in aged care.



The Minister also admitted the Morrison Government’s regulator ceased unannounced visits to

aged care homes at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.



How can anyone trust this Government when it is only now admitting that the Regulator

ceased visits to facilities for months?



The Morrison Government is completely in the dark about the serious risks of COVID-19 in

aged care.



New announcements today for aged care is just further confirmation the Morrison Government

never had a proper plan to deal with COVID-19.



Despite this, Scott Morrison continues to stand by his failed Minister for Aged Care who had



been ‘sidelined’ in his portfolio and isn’t even trusted to answer questions.



The Minister for Aged Care is not across basic details, he’s not in Cabinet and he’s been cut

out of the decision-making process. He walks away from scrutiny.



The Morrison Government has been behind the eight ball on aged care for years and we are

now seeing the tragic impact of this with COVID-19.
