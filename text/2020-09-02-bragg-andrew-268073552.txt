FinTech & RegTech Interim Report

The Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Financial Technology and Regulatory  Technology, Senator Andrew Bragg, tabled an interim report containing 32  recommendations today.

“As Australia faces its first recession in 30 years, it’s clear we need more jobs and the only  way to do that is to embrace technology and become globally competitive,” Senator Bragg  said.

“It is my hope this interim report can be seen as a series of quick wins: new jobs and more  choice,” he said.

Senator Bragg highlighted several recommendations.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Research and Development. Further clarification around eligibility for tax incentives  to ensure genuine software creation by Australian startups is reliably supported.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Establish a new national body to deliver the landmark Consumer Data Right.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Create a stronger competition mandate to promote innovation and guard against anti-

competitive behaviour in Australia.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Support for innovation and consumer choice like Buy Now Pay Later products.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Regularly assess Australia’s global competitive position & implement the remaining

recommendations from the Johnson Review.

“The Committee has made a number of other recommendations in the areas of regulation,  tax, capital and funding, skills and talent, and culture,” he said.

“Australia should continue developing as a leading Asia-Pacific FinTech nation especially as  Hong Kong declines as a financial centre.”

“More jobs and better consumer choice will emerge if we are competitive and iterative in our  approach to policy formulation,” Senator Bragg said.

“We’ve already shown we can be smarter and more innovative during the pandemic. That’s  why we’ve called for the extension of virtual AGMs, technology neutral laws and a  permanent telehealth system.”

The Committee’s final report is due in April 2021.



Ends.

Senate Select Committee on Financial Technology and Regulatory  Technology Tabling Speech - Interim Report

I am very pleased to be chairing this inquiry, which is about facilitating increased competition  and innovation in Australia's financial sector and beyond.

While Australia officially slips into the first recession in 30 years, it is clear that we need more  jobs. But we must embrace technology to be globally competitive. There is no other way.

The committee was established in September last year, and following an extensive round of  public submissions and hearings in January and February, the committee was due to table  this interim report in March this year.

However, COVID-19 intervened, and the committee decided to reopen submissions and take  further evidence at hearings in the middle part of the year before finalising this report.

In total, the inquiry has now received more than 200 written submissions from a broad range  of stakeholders and held ten public hearings. Following this substantial interim report, the  committee will consider further matters relevant to its terms of reference and present a final  report in April 2021.

Put simply, the inquiry is about more jobs and more choice - that is the dividend of these  sectors growing.

Technology should not be feared. The computer age has delivered enormous growth in jobs.  Technology is a job creator - not a job killer.

FinTech (Financial Technology) is commonly defined as organisations combining innovative  business models and technology to enable, enhance and disrupt financial services.

Australia has a vibrant and growing FinTech sector, with a significant number of startups and  scaleups as well as several established unicorns that clearly show the incredible potential of  this sector of the economy.

RegTech (Regulatory Technology) is the use of new technology to undertake regulatory  monitoring, reporting and compliance functions.

To review and organise the material presented to the committee through the inquiry thus far,  the committee has chosen to view it through 5 buckets: tax, regulation, access to capital,  skills and talent, and culture.

The committee also received specific evidence relating to the impact of COVID-19 and  technology enablers that have risen to prominence during the crisis.

The committee has made 32 recommendations across all of these areas.



COVID-19 Challenges and Digital Transformation

It is clear from evidence received by the committee that COVID-19 has had a material  impact on FinTechs, and the tech sector more broadly.

But as the pandemic has shown, adaptability and technology underpin the jobs of today- let  alone tomorrow.

While some businesses, particularly well-established FinTechs and those in specific niches,  have ‘ridden the wave’ and experienced significant growth over this period, many newer  companies have struggled, with loss of capital inflows and faltering customer acquisition.



The sector has received significant support from a number of government initiatives,  including JobKeeper as well as programs to support non-bank lending.

The committee has made several recommendations in relation to these technology enablers,  including: allow electronic company meetings and communications; allowing for electronic  signing and witnessing of legal documents; continuing the rollout of telehealth services on a  permanent basis; and the utilisation of electronic prescriptions.

The committee also identified accelerating progress on the Australian Government’s digital  identity reforms as a key opportunity, as well as the potential for RegTech to be used to  facilitate compliance with industrial awards.

Taxation Issues

On tax issues, the committee heard that a competitive tax framework will assist FinTechs  and RegTechs to reach their potential and maximise the impact of the sector in Australia’s  future growth.

The operation of the Research and Development Tax Incentive (R&DTI) was raised by a  number of industry participants, due to uncertainty around the eligibility of software  development for the program, and concern about retrospective audits which can result in  companies having to pay back the incentive.

The committee has made recommendations for additional clarity in these areas, while noting  that further legislative changes to the RDTI are currently under consideration by the  Economics Legislation Committee.

The report also calls on the Council for Federal Financial Relations to simplify payroll tax  across jurisdictions in Australia.

Regulation

Looking at the way competition in financial services is regulated in Australia, it is abundantly  clear that the current approach is fragmented and unclear, with the ACCC, ASIC, APRA and  the RBA all playing roles.

Witnesses viewed this fragmentation as a risk, and saw the need for Australia's financial  regulators to collectively provide greater focus on promoting competition and innovation in  the financial system, if Australia is to stand any chance of competing with the likes of  Singapore and the UK.



The committee’s recommendations in this area are:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Providing the Council of Financial Regulators with a competition mandate, and ensuring  that it regularly reports on competitive dynamics in the Australian financial services market  and provides advice on these issues to government; and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Requiring the Council of Financial Regulators to consider and report on Australia’s external  competitive position in financial services.

The committee also supports self-regulation where innovative products emerge, whilst  ensuring strong consumer protection. We have used the example of Buy Now Pay Later  products as a positive, innovative development which should be supported by a system of  “co-regulation”.

We were not convinced that the way to promote innovation was to force new ideas into old  forms of regulation and laws designed for something altogether different.

An important regulatory reform that is underway to encourage greater competition and  provide consumers with more power is the Consumer Data Right (CDR). The committee  considers that a single, standalone body is required to manage this program, particularly as  it is rolled out to further sectors in the economy. The CDR is too important to be managed by  a wing in the ACCC.

Access to Capital

Turning to the issue of access to capital, evidence received by the committee highlighted the  critical role that capital flows play in fostering the growth of innovative businesses in  Australia, including FinTechs and RegTechs.

The committee has made recommendations to strengthen the operation of the Early Stage  Venture Capital Limited Partnerships program and the Early Stage Innovation Company tax  incentive.

The committee heard that these programs require tweaking in order to reach their full  potential and attract additional capital into startups.

The committee has also recommended the creation of further Collective Investment  Vehicles, a reform to enhance Australia’s global attractiveness as an investment destination.

These reforms are well overdue, having initially been recommended by the Johnson review  in 2009.

If we have a serious prospect of beating Singapore in winning business from the ailing Hong  Kong, we must enact these reforms to attract capital.

Skills, Talent and Culture

On issues relating to skills, talent and culture, the committee has made recommendations  across several areas.

The committee has recommended the Government work with industry to ensure re-skilling of  workers affected by economic change, and ensure the availability and accessibility of  microcredentials for those seeking to join the FinTech and RegTech industries.



It should also explore the option of including eligible outplacement training under the Fringe  Benefit Tax exemption provision for eligible startups.

The committee is also calling for the government to examine options for enabling startups to  compete in government procurement processes, as well as the introduction of government-led, challenge-based innovation initiatives to enable X-tech firms to solve policy and service  delivery challenges.

Conclusion

The package of recommendations brings together many loose ends and turns them into a  package.

The committee will continue to engage with the sector as it moves into the next phase of this  inquiry.

Just like our FinTechs, we (Government) must be iterative and responsive as we undertake  our work.  A positive disposition to technology is one thing.

The next is to have a plan for Australia to be competitive.

The plan to be competitive in FinTech is the same plan for Australia to be competitive in  technology and across the economy.

The fundamental need to be competitive is the same as it was before the pandemic. The  need for reform is now more acute because we are in a recession and competing globally for  new investment.

We have the brains. We have the skills. All we need to do is unlock our technology prowess  by breaking down some old-fashioned barriers.

I wish to thank the other members on the committee for their interest, engagement and  collegiate approach to the operation of the committee, and note that the vast majority of  recommendations in this report were agreed to with bipartisan support.

I particularly wish to thank the Deputy Chair and fellow millennial, Senator Marielle Smith,  and Committee members Senator Paul Scarr, Senator Susan McDonald and Senator Jess  Walsh for their support in the compilation of this report.

It would be remiss of me not to personally thank Committee Secretary, Lyn Beverley, for her  commitment and guidance over the past year.

And finally, I want to acknowledge the father of Fintech in Australia - the Prime Minister Scott  Morrison, who has been a champion for FinTech since his days as Treasurer when he set  the ball rolling on Australian FinTech. He established the Consumer Data Right, opened the  Fintech Bridge with the UK and led the reforms on early stage innovation companies.

The government is full of FinTech supporters - the Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and  Australia’s first Financial Technology Minister, Jane Hume. They are a great team and I am  proud to serve alongside them. I hope these recommendations will be adopted by the  executive government.



I look forward to presenting the committee’s final report in April 2021.
