One visit won’t change regional Queenslanders view on Labor’s coal support

Labor’s Climate Change spokesman, Chris Bowen, should be using his Central Queensland  visit to say sorry to coal miners rather than lecture them on emissions targets.

It’s taken two years for a federal Labor frontbencher to visit a coal mine after the party  abandoned the industry, and its workers, in the lead up to the 2019 election. In fact, Labor’s  Deputy leader Richard Marles said it would be a good thing if world coal prices collapsed.

It seems Labor’s key message to coal miners is that their skill set will transfer to the  renewables sector, so they’ll be well placed to install solar panels. Try telling that to a diesel  fitter, mining engineer or High Voltage certified Electrician.

Despite what Mr Bowen may try and say, regional Queenslanders know that Labor doesn’t  really support the mining industry and can’t be trusted to support the thousands of jobs it  creates.

Labor is dominated by its left-green faction in the capital cities, which has made it clear it  wants to see the end of Australia’s coal and gas industries.

Only the Coalition Government has consistently shown its ongoing support for Queensland’s  coal sector.

Coal makes a significant contribution to the Queensland and national economy and will  continue to do so for decades to come.

The men and women who’ve kept the industry going through the COVID-19 pandemic  deserve our thanks, not more lectures from another inner city economist, more at home in  a designer suit than hi-vis and hard hat.
