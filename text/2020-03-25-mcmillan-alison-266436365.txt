Training to help nurses re-enter the health workforce

The Australian Government will provide funding for registered nurses to undertake online  education to enable them to re-enter the clinical workforce and assist with the national  response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite swift action by Australian governments, the number of COVID-19 cases will  continue to grow.

It is likely that unprecedented demand for health care will put pressure on our health system  and health professionals, especially doctors and nurses whose work is vital to protecting and  saving lives.

The Government will provide up to $1 million to the Australian College of Nursing (ACN) to  provide an online refresher course with up to date information about acute nursing care,  including latest evidence based guidelines on COVID-19 infection control.

The course will be available immediately to eligible registered nurses who hold current  general registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia, and who meet the  recency of Practice Registration Standard of 450 hours practice within the last five years.

Up to 1000 eligible nurses will be able to undertake the training free of charge.

This new investment builds on the Australian Governmentâ€™s announced $2.4 billion health  package aimed at protecting all Australians, including vulnerable groups such as the elderly,  those with chronic conditions and Indigenous communities, from COVID-19.

Eligible nurses interested in undertaking the training should visit acn.edu.au/refresher or  contact the Australian College of Nursing, by email at customerservices@acn.edu.au or by  phone on 1800 265 534.
