LABOR BACKS FLIGHTS TO SUPPORT AUSTRALIAN EXPORTERS

Labor welcomes the Morrison Government’s announcement it will spend $110 million to  boost international trade by helping to arrange cargo flights carrying seafood, beef and  dairy exports to key markets.

Australia is a major food exporter, with thousands of jobs dependent on this sector. It is  therefore crucial that the Government do all it can to ensure access to our key agricultural  markets during this crisis.

Under the package, special freight flights from Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth will  carry products to China, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.

This is particularly important for seafood exporters in Western Australia, who were among  the earliest hit by the coronavirus outbreak in China.

Labor also welcomes Trade Minister Simon Birmingham’s announcement that the  Government will inject an extra $49.8 million into the Export Market Development Grants  (EMDG) program.

Small businesses have told me in recent weeks that bolstering funding for the EMDG  would be a practical measure to assist exporters through the COVID-19 crisis.

Labor supports the EMDG, which facilitates reimbursements for businesses seeking to  grow through exporting into the global market.

At the same time, we are aware that there are often missed opportunities for Australian  businesses utilising the scheme, with issues surrounding accessibility, functionality, and  reimbursement delays.

Labor will continue to work with Australian exporters to ensure they can survive this crisis.
